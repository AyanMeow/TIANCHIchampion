"The author finishes it with this because spring time is a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test she wants to start over in the spring like the flowers do. To know that the hibiscus will grow back though now it is dying. For spring to come is a time to start a new, where babies are born, flowers are at blom and a new beggening is forming",0
"The author concluded the story with this paragraph heshe wanted to compare Saeng life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test and then she saw a plant the reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license.",0
"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, created a mood of joy and happyness. It set this mood because he can have a nice and happy life. I think its happy that he can express his feelings to us the reader. The writer makes me feel joyful because it reminds me of what my family is like. ""My parents always had their arms and door wide open to friends and people we consired family."" My mother always has her heart and arms open to anyone who needs to be loved. It is also joyful to know that most of his family will be coming to live with him. The writer tells us about how his grandfather and grandmother will be coming to the United States when they are allowed to leave Cuba. That is the mood the memoir set of me to understand it.",0
"I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent. There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library, but some of it could be useful.     There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library. When I went home to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive, not to mention awkward and embarassing. My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie 'CAPS1'.      Although there are some materials that should not be in the library, there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes. Some people think gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive. There MONTH1 be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives. Somebody MONTH1 have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman MONTH1 be thinking about recieving an abortion. What is offensive to some, MONTH1 not be offensive to others.     I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials. If it is educational, it MONTH1 be useful to some people. There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world. As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world.",0
"The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the  high   deserts of California    (kurmaskie NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills    (Kurmaskie NUM1   ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one   of them as a    long, crippling hill  (Kurmaskie NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got   increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist.",0
"One day I had to go to the doctors office to get shots. When we got into the doctors office I had to wait in some uncomfortable chairs, with my dad. It was my first time getting shots, and I didnt know how it felt. Since I was little, it was harder for me to have patience, I just wanted it over with. I kept on asking my dad is the doctor coming yet, and my dad would always say patience. It got to the point when my dad was so frustrated, and he told me to go play with some toys; which I did not notice until then. But when I saw those fun toys gleaming in the sunlight I ran to them. But after a few minutes it got so boring, so I went back and sat down. It was getting so boring I couldnt take it anymore! I wanted to scream! But then I couldnt take it, I started to get so mad, wanted to just get out of there. But I didnt let my dad know, because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out, and said CAPS1, and I was releved that the doctor finally came to give me shots. But what I didnt know was that I was going getin horrible pain for a few days.",0
"Some books are not suitable for kids. They could make a section for adults that includes books that are not censored. These books should not be aloud to be checked out by kids under the age of NUM1 unless their parent or guardian allows them to. Some adults don't care what there kids read but the library should. I've read books at school that were adult books at school.      Back in elementary school, I remember checking out alot of books but I don't think they were adult books. Some kids enjoy reading adult books. It helps their reading skills but the content in the book is not suitable for them.     Making a section for adults would help stop kids from reading adult material. I believe that this should take place at every library around the world.",0
"As a student at a public school, the libraries that I and many other students have access to are censored to an extent. With our library being censored I do not feel that the public library should be.          Why is censorship a conflict in need of discussion; every book found on a shelf is a part of history so every author that was good enough to get published should be able to have their book on a shelf. While school libraries are already censored for their age group; I feel that public libraries should not be censored for the plain reason that you, your gaurdian, but also the library has control over what they find age appropriate.           If disliking the book is a problem; then put it back. Find something more common towards your own interest. Some things MONTH1 be considered inappropriate as many things are, but at the same time each person has their own limits to this. While someone MONTH1 dislike a teen magazine because of how it effects youth, another MONTH1 find it inspiring. If every person found a way to rate things according to their own taste, there would be nothing left on the shelves; as Katherine Paterson expressed in her quote.          When you enter a public library; it is divided into sections according to interest, age, author, ect.. When you enter a school library it is done according to fiction, non-fiction and author. Censorship amoung public libraries is not needed. Adults, students, and childeren all go to a public library. So, as the case MONTH1 be why would you censor a library that goes for all ages. I feel that yes an CAPS1, or CAPS2 school library should not contain the same content as a CAPS3 school library. But a public library, is for the public. Hints the name.          In conclusion, if even more censorship was done to public libraries, libraries would be used less than they already are. Some of the content in public libraries can't be found in school libraries, but also adults wouldn't be able to find the content needed for their own interests, jobs, or even schooling. So as the fact MONTH1 be that some things MONTH1 seem innappropriate to certain age groups, it can help someone in a completely different age group.",0
"When I was around the age NUM1. I went to CAPS1 with my grandpa, grandma, and mom, and dad for a family reunen, we stoped so menny times I cant even count. I think it was to but I did not want to stop or be patient because I wanted to get there and see what everything looked like like it was big but the dad post was we hade to leave are dog home for a week, was in patient to get home to because as soon as I got home I was going to sleep. We got up to leave from are house at TIME1 and we got to the motel at TIME2 am the after noon I was sick of sitting in the car I did not want to get back in the car to go home because if you think of it that is long ways to white in the car. I was very impatient because if I could of gotten there in a half of a hour or a have would have been a lot better than like, NUM2 hours of time but it was a lot of fun to see new things that you have never seen befor on your way there because on are way home. I was just sleeping. But I was not very patient I was so board that every stop I would switch cars and I did not have tating at that time but I did have my CAPS2 until it died then I made my I pod and my cells all I could do was call and play games on that but I was so impatient at the coner to cuzz I rather go to the hotel and sleep than sit there lission to older people talk bout what has happened. I dont know hardly any of them I could not tell you who every one was.",0

She is stating that she is not going to take the test of buying one again until the geese return and the Hibiscus budds.",0
"From birth to young adulthood, kids are raised by their guardians or parents. It is the parent's responsibility to convey to their children good morals, life skills, and to teach them how to cope and thrive in society. CAPS24 parenting children requires being firm and strictly reinforcing rules. The result of this however, is the child leaves their parents prepared to live their adult lives outside the home.It is safe to say that although I am a still a teenager, I have learned quite a lot about raising kids. My knowledge mostly being based off of stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons. Being ""in on"" these small, yet significant bits of history is quite enjoyable for me. I'd have to say that although many of the facts about the ""good old days"" are great, it is the almost tangible memories which my family connects with laughter that are the most significant to me. My CAPS1 grew up in the DATE1's living in a small yet average sized house with her CAPS1, CAPS3, and four brothers and sisters. The main subject which is the focus of the stories my CAPS1 retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table. It was her CAPS5's (my CAPS6's) goal, for his children to learn proper manners and standard etiquette. It was expected of the PERSON3 children to practice this by being calm, courteous, and mindful of their physical actions when gathered around the table for dinner. For an average, fun, causal, and not so dignified CAPS7 family, that was a lot to ask. Throughout their childhood my CAPS1 and her siblings tried their very best to behave and do as they were told at the dinner table. The only common occurrence that was particularly displeasing to my CAPS6 was when someone spilled their milk. This fateful event happened almost every night. When milk was spilled it was either the cause of a child engaging in funny business, or it was a result of reaching to far to retrieve the butter dish. Whatever the reason, it was somehow hysterically funny when this occurred. The only catch was, that laughing at the table was frowned upon for it seemed to break the formal mood the family strove for during the evening meal. Laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the dinner table. Spilling milk did not continue to happen as often as the children grew up, but that is not to say that is discontinued it's presence at the dinner table completely. One night it was not my CAPS1 nor any of her siblings that spilled their milk. Instead, it was my CAPS6. When the initial incident occurred, the whole family was in a state of shock. In effort to clean up the mess everyone donated their napkin, while their CAPS3 maintained a controlled but disgruntled demeanor. When all was cleaned up, the family went on with their meal and on my CAPS6's face was a subtle yet unmistakable grin. Years later my CAPS1 (PERSON4), PERSON1, CAPS15 CAPS16, PERSON2, and PERSON2 CAPS17 grew up, got married, and some even began families of their own. Most of my CAPS1's family lives in LOCATION2 so they enjoyed coming up to visit their CAPS1 and CAPS3 (my CAPS21 and CAPS6) at the holidays or whenever they were able. During these times when the entire family is able to gather here in LOCATION1, there is hardly ever a somber or serious moment at the dinner table. As my CAPS3 would say, ""CAPS24 we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs.""  I attribute to the fun we have together to this bond of love that connects us all, and I feel it would not be as prominent without the element of laughter. I feel that my CAPS6 (who is now in heaven with CAPS21), accomplished the goal of preparing his children for life. Now that they are all grown up, they can let loose, enjoy each others company, and feel free to bust out in laughter even if there is a risk of someone spilling their milk.",0
"Everyone has an opinion. Don't you agree? That's what makes us different, this is why some of us would rather watch CAPS1 compared to CAPS2, or why some want to listen to pop instead of country. A library is a place that brings all sorts of people together. It's a place of interest and information, a place for research and enjoyment. So here is my question: 'Do we really want to remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive.'?I don't believe so, as the quote says by the author, Katherine Paterson, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I agree with that statement! Think about this, if we allowed people to get rid of the library books they just don't like, if everyone had that right. We would have no more books, no materials left to study or pleasure read.I have to admit I've seen things that I don't necessarily agree with, but other people might. You can't just have a library all to yourself. Something for just your interests and nobody elses. That's not what a library is for, millions of people use libraries for different purposes. So no I really don't think we should remove items from the shelves. Only pick up what you find interresting and leave it at that. We all have rights just like we all have likes, dislikes, and minds of our own.Opinions define us, choices shape us, but libraries do so much more, they advance our knowledge, make our dreams a reality, and sometimes even broaden our horizons. We need books, music, movies, and even magazines, but we need them all together. That's my position on this topic, I hope this helped form yours.",0
This was one day when I had to do something that I didnt want to do and if I didnt do it I couldnt go no were or go to the movies. When I was at my aunt house an I had to clean up her house an I didnt want to do it so she had told me that her house should be clean when she come back home an I was the only one there. When I went to CAPS1 point everybody went on this scary high in the sky ride an you have  to take your shoes of than we got something to eat. The next day when everybody wolk up we heat from the hotel and went home an ate breakfast an than I didnt wont to ride my uncle four wheeler down the hill but he had started it up an push it but I had on knee pads and elbow pads and gloves. When I got to my grandma house.

I was getting picked up early from school because that night I was going to the ORGANIZATION2 and ORGANIZATION1. When I woke up I was so excited! I had been waiting for that day for a whole four months! I was so happy it was finally the day; when I got to school I had to tell everyone the news.

"In this passage the mood to me is like relaxing and a soothing gratefulness towards his parents. The tone of his voice is not angry, not happy happy but soothing. Obviously Narciso loves his family and loves LOCATION1. By the tone of the narrators voice shows that. Coming to CAPS1 was a great change as he said because you leave behind so many friends, family and the presence of the culture. Family to Narciso is his relatives but culture as well. As you can see the tone of the narrators voice really makes the story interesting.",0
"The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was going to drop from heat exsostion, he is riding through the desert in DATE1, and he took directions from three old gentlemen sitting on a porch.",0
The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.,0
To me the mood of the author is happy. Thinks he's happy because in the article it talks about how he grow up and where he lived through his entire life. Also it talks about when Narciso Rodriguez arrived in the United States which was in 1956. Plus it talks about how he helped the poor people in his own country before he moved to the US. Narciso Rodriguez did alot of stuff to help his country survive before he left.,0
"CAPS1 has come to my attention that some people have been concerned about using computers too much. Well, I disagree with this statement. I think the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer also lets you up a leave more a foriegn people and paces. Lastly, computers helps you communicate with others. As recently stated, I think computers are useful because they help with your hand-eye coordination. For example, when you write papers for school or a document for work, you're using the coordination. You didn't even notice how once hang of typing, you tend to move faster. This machine is a beautiful invention please don't take CAPS1 away!. The computer is also to everyday life and is very useful for learning new things about far away places and people. Another thing that you dont realizes when using a computer is that the you do from someone in your but from long distance places. How would you get that information without spending a ton on airfare or gas? The computer is the quickest way to find out information! Finally, the computer is an important resource because you can chat with your friends. A CAPS2 researcher showed that computers You can chat CAPS3, I think computers has affects on all! They teach hand-eye coordination, they teach you about far away places computer lets you chat online with your friends! I CAPS4 you see the computer the way I do.",0
"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The CAPS1 prints of Our Lives is grateful. This is shown by how Narciso explains in detail the major chronologically ordered events his life. Narciso also includs little sentences in parentheses explaining what he had just said or telling how grateful he was for it. This happens for example when Narciso states: ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows how he is greatful his parents taught him how to cook, which he still does today. Narciso also shows his gratefullness by making it abundantly clear how gratefull he was to have parents that taught and did so much for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez created gratefullness as the overall mood in his piece. the did this by showing how thankful he was to have parents who taught and did so much for him.",0
"Inappropriate magazines in the reach of children?!? 'CAPS1 just not right', says reporter PERSON1, 'I think that magazines, books, and other profanities should be out of the reach of children and only discussed when chosen by an adult'. Libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library. If children see something that they want with no guardian then they shouldn't get it, its just that simple.     Although the books can seem inappropriate to some people they should not be taken off the shelves because older books help children learn about what happened in the earlier days, it teaches them some of the ways that we use now, and it shows real stories about people in modern day. For example some of the books about ORGANIZATION1 connect some people as being to abrassive and mocking, but it just shows what happened long before there were laws for racism. The books about NUM1 also come provacative to some people because they lost someone close during the bombing, the books teach the kids that not everyone is nice and cruel things happen to some good people.Books about peoples life are also in libraries talking about what happened to them as they were kids or how their parents died of cancer, the books teach the children that outcomes can turn out for the good or the bad.     Some entertainment is not intended for kids to see, for example, pornography and provacative language. Pornography is thought to be an entertainment for adults, but many times it is just something that can scare kids at young ages if they do not know what is really happening. Also, provacative language in a book or on a cd is not something that kids should be listening to. However, they need to learn that if they hear those words they need to know not to say them so they don't get into trouble by their parents.     Books of history are thought to be helpful when children are growing up. Most of the time that is correct, about PERCENT1 of the children take in the information and use it to help them. However, there is PERCENT2 of children out there that will just think of the information that they are being told as good things. ORGANIZATION2 didn't just wake up one day and say im going to bomb the CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4. His devious plans and clever mastermining took alot of time to plan out.     People MONTH1 object to children learning some things about history, but i think it is needed for every child to understand. Everyone needs to know about the ups and downs about their country and the others surrounding them. Children MONTH1 not understand right now what is wrong with the economy, but they will soon learn when they are adults why people complain so much. Books about this stuff MONTH1 come offensive to some people, but down the road books are used for many things, we still learn about people from hundreds of years ago.     Children will soon learn of the harsh conditions and the reason why things happen. Without the books and the videos the future will never know what happened. Many young people MONTH1 change words in books, but the books will always still have what really happened. CAPS1 why i think that the libraries should keep the books on the shelves, just out of reach of the children",0
"The author creates a gratefull mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph NUM1 the NUM2 sentence the author states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This CAPS1 that the author is gratefull enough to have parents even though they are not his biological blood related parents. In paragraph NUM3 In the first NUM4 sentences the author is talking about how his parents came to this country with carage and without speaking the language or knowing the culture. He also mentioned in those sentences how to give their children a better life meant leaving behind families, friends and careers in their original country. This CAPS1 that the author is also generous because he realizes the love and sacrafice it takes to do this. Also, In paragraph NUM5 sentence NUM4 he says that he has told his parants that what they did was brave because he would have never been able to do what they did. It really displays how grateful the author is, and how much he admires his parents.",0

"For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph.

She said when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again.

"Censorship is method of limiting certain contant that has been deemed inapropriate. This method is widely used today in the modern world. Censorship is used most commonly with our movies, video games, and television. If other forms of entertainent like television and internet utilize such methods shouldn't our libraries.Also if these methods are not made manditory should there be a block on certain tittles that our children could get there hands on.       This limiting agent called censorship can be very usefull in our everyday lives. Censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and teens view. This agent can currently be installed on such products as our televisions, computers, and phones. So if the procautionary measuers are being taken on the following products wouldn't it be appropriate for the actions to also be in our libraries. Shouldn't our libraries be a place for children to waunder through the shelves picking up and reading books at random without the thought of picking up an inaproiate book for their age group. Personally that is what a library should be like to me.         Discussing the topic that was touched on before .A block should be manditory for libraries. This block would not abolish the books completly but rather would limit their viewing audience. The books should be cateragized by age group. And with the block certain children, based on age ,would not be able to enter the section and would prevent certain materals from reaching children that are not mature enough.     Certain materials should not be view by younger children. That is not only a statement based on opinion but also of fact. The factual experiance comes into play when young children are reading and looking at pictures that were intended for maturer audiences. These tittles heavily influence a childs thoughts and actions. Just the other day a cousin of mine no older than NUM1 years old was watching two individuals of the opposite sex and began asking questions such as: when are they going to kiss? or why is he not touching her? These questions do not come naturally but only through her viewing of material that she was not ready to view. The origin of these question will probably never be known but there are ways to prevent such topics from being brought up and that is censoring what children read, view or listen to in our libraries",0

"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large deregible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used.",0
"The contents of the books in libraries vary in many way. Some are children's books, some are adult books, and some are in between. Libraries have books that spark interest in a reader. Not all books are made for a particular age group or gender. Which that should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novel,magazines,music,or movies. A library is suppose to be for anyone that enjoys to read a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don't like the text or the meanings behind that book , song, or movie.     In the library, in our little town, splits up the variations of the reading materials,music,and movies. There is a children's section, that has all the books we all grew up with, in half the building. Also an audult section for larger novels topics that teens and younger children would have no interest in or their parents would want them reading. Another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest.      With the ideas that people are writing about today we can not possible control what comes to their mind. Some of the greatest books that are out are probably have the deepest meanings that some audiences don't prefere to listen to. But that is what is so great is that people have the liberty to go and find a book, or a magazine, or even CAPS1 that they like.When freedom of what you read is taken away reader will stop reading. Doesn't the admisistrations of schools want kids to read to get their test scores up? If you take away what they like to read doesn't that mean they will stop reading? Also doesn't that mean the test scores will go down?     In my experience of topics that I have read about have been more grown up than my mother would like,but the fact of it is, is that people will read what they want. People don't like to be told no in my personal experience. Taking away topics that are well liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers. I believe that they should not censor books, music, movies, magazines, etc. because that would mean the libraries would be gone",0
"The features of the setting inhance the cyclists desparate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around. This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as Welchs Grape Juice factory and bottling plant which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.",0
"There are many obstacles that the builders faced in order to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. One obstacle was safety. Foreign countries used highly flammable gases to fill their dirigibles with. According to the passage ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle was whether. The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. For example, U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles couldn't tie up to the mast because of the wind, which might have resulted in a puncture in the shell of the dirigible. One more obstacle was the law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. According to the passage ""This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area""... Because of the many obstacles that the builders faced, the Empire State building was unable to fulfill its original purpose, but is still considered a worldwide landmark today.",0
"ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great benefits to our society. Whether it is because it helps people get their work done. Or it allows people to communicate without telephone numbers. Maybe it's because it helps students study. With any of these reasons, computers are really benefiting our society. Have you ever had a paper assigned one day and due the next? If you think back what had helped you complete the paper? Most likley it was a computer. In a recent survey PERCENT1 of college students say that they would not be getting the good grades that the were getting if they didn't have a computer. But, computers don't just help students, they can also help adults in the working community. I know that I have made friends over the years that have moved away and that I have lost touch with. With a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them. With different types of programs, you could most likley find anyone. Whether it's CAPS1, CAPS2, CAPS3, or CAPS4. Nine out of ten adults said that they found a lof of their highschool friends thanks to the computers. Furthermore, computers are a way for students to study. Students could find search engines and reasearch a paper. Or they could play educational games. With a computer if a student forgot his or her homework they could most likley use a computer to find out what the work was. When I went to the middle school to survey, NUM1 out of NUM2 students said that they would check to see if it was on the computer before asking a friend. So as you can see computers have benifits to our society today. Three just happen to be that they help people get work done faster, they help keep you in touch with friends and they help students to study.",0
"the mood in the memoir can be exaessed in many different ways. The memoir is mostly eprssed with gratitude from Narciso to his parents. He describes in good detail all the sacrifices his parents made for him. Leaving behind all their friends and family, the hot climate, and their cultures back in Cuba. Another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness. Narciso's parents were kind to everyone. They turned their house into a hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go. They had open dinner where friends and family members came. Even when they struggled financially they still let everyone in. Narciso's parents made the biggest sacrifice for him. What they did for him created the beautiful moods described in the memor.",0
"How many of you have ever heard any offensive language? Seen somthing that you think no other kid should see? Im going to guess a lot. Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have. Most hear curse words before they can even walk. If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries. After all it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace.      Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong, but they learn from it. It allows them to mature and grow up. Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said. Yet, most will and see what happends and learn from it. If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn?      The books that children read varys. The younger kids wont know what bad words are until they get older. The books that older kids read MONTH1 have words in it to display a seriouse part to the story, or a tragic monment in the characters life. Some MONTH1 even tell of what happens when the characters says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it.       Authers usally vary their vocabulay in the stories that they write. If they are writing about the DATE1's why would they try and clean up the grammer that was spoken from that time. Try and change what the reader might think about that time.      Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them. Kids always see and hear someing oddensive no matter how hard their parents try. Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history. Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in",0
The author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she wants that same envioronment and everything she wanted before when she took the test,0
"CAPS1 paper CAPS2 The computers we have do benefits our society, because it makes people smarter, it's a way to talk to people who live far from where you live, and it's a great way to do homework if you still in school. Having a computer is a great way to get you smarter.You could go on diffrent websites to help you learn what your stuck on in school. I remember the time I was having trouble in math, so my teacher gave me this website called a ORGANIZATION1. It goes over on waht you need help on, and you get a live tutor. The computer could teach babies how to talk. It taught my cousin how to talk and he's NUM1 NUM12 years old. Isn't that amazing on that computers can do. Next I will talk about how computers are a great resource to talk to far away people you MONTH1 know. When you have computers you could talk to people that live across the LOCATION1 woudn't you want to talk to somebody long distance without paying extra money on your cell-phone? I remember one time I was talking to my dad cause I had no minuts on my phone and it went great talking to him on the computer. Having a computer is kind of like a bigger cellphone. You could talk to a family or a friend if you or they don't have a phone. Lastly, I will talk about how you could do homework. Having a computer you could do a lot of homework. Last time I was on my computer I had to find out about PERSON1 for math, so I typed his name and his biography came so I wrote about him. You could use it for all subjects especially language arts you could type up papers and look up diffrent things you had to do in class. Would you want to write a NUM3 page essay and makin your fingers cramp up just writing no. so you just go on the computer and type it up without cramping your fingers CAPS3 reconsider your opinion, cause computers can get you smarter, talk far away people and help you with homework.",0
"I strongly believe that computers effect us in a positive way. Computers are advancing and so are their uses, computers are great and they are not our thought process or went to run around outside and play sports. Computers help us find and talk to relatives and friends they allow us to learn different things about farien places. They also are great for research! First and foremost computers are effecting us positively expesally when it comes to finding and talking to family and friends. My mom was adopted and NUM1 years ago she really wanted to find her birth family, one year later her birth father found her on this website where you can locate family, she found her family and I now have two more CAPS1, PERSON1 and PERSON2, and a cousin PERSON4. I love them all very much. I would not have of been able to get to know them if it wasnt for the computer, speaking of communication, I was working like a dog on this big science prodject I had. we weren't able to do it in person and it CAPS3 impossible for one person to three way four people. So we emailed our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done. ""CAPS2 are never enough hours in the day!"" CAPS3 something that CAPS3 commonly said. Over PERCENT1 of adults complain that CAPS2 CAPS3 never enough time in day. That CAPS3 a statistic from ORGANIZATION1. The computer allows you to multi task so you can be on your business call and email your mother so she know that you didn't forget her birthday. In addition, computers help us understand other countries and learn about their culture and how they are doing. CAPS2 are many people who don't have tvs and they get their news from the internet. Also for projects, in NUM2 grade I had to learn about CAPS4, the country in LOCATION2. it would take countless hours to find research in books, you will find a lot of stuff you dont need, but on the computer it CAPS3 fast and easy. If you need to know something you can just type it in and, boom! You have it where as if you were usinf a book you would still be looking for what you need. Time CAPS3 something that we can't afford to waste expessaly in this economy. Furthermore, computers are great for all kinds of research and directions. People who think that people spend too much time on the computer, and exersizing are not always right. I don't know about you, PERSON3, but I am constantly looking up different exersizes to get a flat stomach. Most of my friends do it with me. I also look up directions, finding routs on maps are enfuriating and take for ever. Go on the computer the maps are always updated and you can get easy and fast directions! I don't know about you but I love things fast and easy. Going back to research, what about for solving crimes? Identifying people with finger prints fast so no one can get hurt. In conclusion computers effect us in possitive ways, more and are a great help to society, from locating people, to communication, and all the way to finding valuable and life changing information. I hope that you and I see eye to eye in this matter, advancing computers are our friends not the enemy.",0
The reason why the author concludes the story like this for himher to have a spin off. I mean to me I think that it mean she is going to try again when spring comes so her and her plant can have a fresh start and I think that is a good way to end it.,0
"As the people of the world are starting to use the computer more and more, I think it has a extremely positive effect on people. Computers are not all fun and games they help with other things as well. For example, some of the amazing things the computer are; teach hand-eye coordination. give people all over the world a chance to learn about the places, people and culture from far away places, and last hit not least, it is another way to allow people to talk online with their friends. Now let me explaine more about what a positve effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one. The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house. It is not for just ga off and playing video games on, it is also very helpful in the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. when you use the computer there os so much you can learn. For instance lets say you have a in your socical or history about the country or and you don't know a thing about it. What do you do? You should log onto you computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about LOCATION1 that you would have never know until you logged onto the computer. The computer is also a great way to practice and get better using your hand-eye coordination. First you need to learn about the of the keys and where they are positioned on the keyboard. After you have that skills, you should try to look at the computer screan. and not be working down at you finger keys. Not only is that not helping you hand-eye coordination, but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen. The computer truely is unbelievable. Are you one of those people who's parents don't you get a phone because use of how much it costs without even the cost of texting? Well if you are, the computer help you out with that problem aswell!! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer. For example, you could use CAPS1 to instant your friends or facebook to learn more and more about somebody. The comp. is so hanndy! So lets recap on what we learned! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world helps w hand-eye coordination, and lets you talk to your friends! I think the comp is a in every household.",0
"People say that technology is affecting everybody left and right. Computers actively help us with our daily lives. It helps us do project for school, let us understand culture around the world, and gives us the ability to talk and connect with friends and family everywhere. Our shool makes us do tons of project and the computer is our main course. If you want to go somewhere far away, you're most likely to research it, and then plan on going. It is also might be used to talk with friends on facebook, twitter, and CAPS3. Computers help us learn and communicate. To start off, as an eight grades, we are prepared to go to high school. Fortunately, it means we do projects, reports, and research on the computer. The computer enables us to find information for a project, or construct a diagram or data table for a survey. Many people use this method for jobs. People do reports on celebrities and famous people from history. Books can't always give the information you are looking for, so they look up that persons name, and they will find our hundred of web sites that give information and photographs of that person. In addition to, computers let you book flights, buy, tax rates. Sometimes, people don't always to go and drive to a local car, so they go online to a website that sells, and they are able to look at all of the features of the car, the price, and mileage. The only way you can get tickets is if you go onto the internet. They have websites that let book whatever kind of flights you want. It can be to go to florida, or it can be a flight to LOCATION1. If you also how the economy is doing, you can look up tax rates and how find out how much our country is in debt. You can even find out how much an average family pays - every year. Computers can be very they resourceful at CAPS2. It gives capability to do more than you can imagine. Most importantly, computers have created a way for you talk to friends and family around the globe. Facebook and twitter are the new things of the century. Facebook and twitter let you talk to friends, post photos and talk about your personal life. They have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games. CAPS3 is not as popular anymore and doesn't have as many cool things. It only let's you talk to friends and that's why no one uses it anymore. People want to be able to do more than just talk. It comes to my attention that computers have over time. Computers these days enable you to talk with friends, do research and projects, and let you book flights and buy cars. Our school's curriculum has many projects and reports. They can be done only by the help of a computer. You can research people and places and or get pictures. You can also book flights for far away trips and buy cars and other items off the internet. We even have the capability to talk with friends on facebook and twitter. Computers have a positive influence on people.",0
"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Katherine Paterson. Katherine Paterson is an auther who, like the quote from her, believes that some books should never reach the hands of children. Does everyone believe the same way,no. I am one of those few people who believe that no one should have the right to remove a book simply because they find the book offensive.     Your an old fashion woman who believes in old fashion ideals such as no cursing or violence. You, as this woman, pick up a book and read the first page, on this page you see cursing and deside to remove all books with violence or cursing from the library. The library soon becomes half empty because of one woman and her belifs. Belifs are a wonderful thing ouside of reading and can make you who you want to be. Books do not, in my opinion, have belifs. This is true for some books but a book where someone runs from danger or flys into the sky, those are not belifs those are dreams and no one can crush dreams offensive or not.     I compair books to dreams simply for the fact that they are dreams, the dreams of the authers who wrote them and wanted to share that dream with the world. Telling a person they can not publish there book simply because another person finds it affensive is telling the auther your dream is offensive. If you do not want your child to share this book of dreams then do not let your child pick up the book. You are the parent of the child who picks up this book then you can protect it from the offensive danger it holds like you protect it from the dangers of strangers in the real world.     Authers do not always write for the sake of everyone. Authers do not write for one woman, one man, one child, authers write for those who share a similer dream. If you do not share the same dream as the auther that is fine, no one is forcing you to share in there sometimes dark and sometimes amazing dreams. Authers write because they wish to write, to express themselfs in ways only words and storys can. Do not shun a book because one thing in it offends you, CAPS1 a book is CAPS1 someones dream.     In short you would never crush your childs dreams. If your child wants to grow up and be a fireman you do not tell them that it is offensive to people so they cant. Why would you do something to someone elses dream who you have never met. Be a bigger person and allow that person to live there dream through a story. No matter the level of offiense you do not have to pick up the book and read it. the number one way to not be affended by a book that MONTH1 affend you is to never read the book to start with.",0
"I think computers are a good thing, people use computers for buissness. Computers allow you to interact with people far away. They also allow you to do research. That is why I think computers are good. Computers can be used for many different things. They can be used for buissness. Some people work at home on computers. They can also be used to interact with people far away. You can interact with someone who you don't see on a daily basis. Computers can also be used for research. You can do research on a school project or on other buissnesses you interact with. Computers are good. Some people use computers for buissness. You can also interact with people far away.

"The cyclist in the article almost died from dehydration and heat stroke and wrote his misadventure in a light hearted, humourous way.

"Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patients at many things. Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever.  Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you dont have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think that having patients will sometimes help you to suceed in life. If your un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or your waiting for will eventually happen someday.",0

"One time when i was spending the night at ORGANIZATION1's she wanted to sleep oustide in a tent. CAPS2 was DATE1 and we always tryed seeing eachother anytime possible because she had to go back to boarding school alot. So her mom set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we ate dinner, we grabbed our things and went ouside. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and i was on the phone with mine, and both of them were best friends. CAPS2 was like two best friends dating two bestfriends, and we were closer then ever. My boyfriend had to get off the phone because he had work in the TIME1 so CAPS2 was just LOCATION1 on the phone. I started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted and at the time she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point i was just cracking up with laughfter, ORGANIZATION1 started laughing even harder because she saw me laughing and pee'd her self while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot that she was on the phone with him and started laughing even more after that happend, so all of this was going on at around one in the TIME1 and i was surprised her mom didn't come out and yell at us for being loud. When i looked over and saw that she had pee'd her self i yelled out ""CAPS1 my god, CAPS3 pee'd your self ORGANIZATION1!"" CAPS2 was the most funniest thing, i dont think i have ever laughed so hard in my entire life. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said ""CAPS3 should probably go take care of that,"" and then they got off the phone. She was really embarassed after that, i mean i would be too if that happend to me.",0

"In the memoir, PERSON1, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author created a mood for PERSON1. The mood the author created was something different, but it never seems to go down.As Narciso Rodriguez really gives you the definition of ""family"", in the memoir. One of the examples the author created for the mood is ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" In the paragraph before that they talked about moving into a new home, and to the heart was the kitchen, they cooked while listening to cubic music. Narciso said, ""she's internally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to cubic music."" Its a happy mood, showing memory. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Narciso's mood is suddenly more strict, but proud of her parents. The last example would be, in all of the last paragraph. ""It was at her home where she learned the real definition of 'family'."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso's mood is so happy and pround to say that her home and family really meant a lot to her. The mood the author created for Narciso Rodriguez was always proud, happy, but never sad. She had a lot of memories from one home.",0
"I would like to state on my behalf that I do not agree that computers are good for society. There are three reasons why I do not agree. Many people will not enjoy the outdoors, CAPS1 people will spend CAPS1 there time on the computer, and a lot of people will gain wheight to inactivity. When you sit on a computer you dont get off of for a while, why, because you are haveing fun. when you are haveing fun you will not stop wat you are doing, CAPS2 dont pay attention. Eventually you will get hooked and play on the computer rather than go outside and have fun with your friends. CAPS4 will just take up all of your time. CAPS2 when you are bored you find anything that you can possibly do, rather than be bored. Many people are thinking this is a good time to go on the computer but CAPS3 you bored you will stay on the computer until you have something to do. My mother always tells me when im bored not stay home because CAPS4 will get worse. There is always something you can do that dosn't you just have to look harder. My last reason is that when you sit at a computer and you are fingers, you gain your wheight you I read NUM1 children in every years will be obese, not because CAPS4 runs in the family but because of inactivity. Inacitivity means not active activity. CAPS3 you calories you will gain weight CAPS6 wheight is unhealthy and you can stop the problem by just finding something spend your whole life on the computer. In conclusion you MONTH1 have mixed thaught's CAPS3 you ever want to go on the computer all the time. CAPS4 doesnt matter CAPS3 you go on just dont all the time. But remember my reasons why not to spend too much time. You will not enjoy the outdoors, find something else to do when you are and you will gain wheight CAPS3 you spend all your time on the computer.",0
"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by Narciso was happiness. I know this because of the following three reasons. One way I know the mood was happiness is when the article said ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on there feet. My parent always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" This showed how Narciso was happy that his parents were nice & very caring. Another way the mood was happiness is when the article said ""I learned the real definition of ""family"". & For this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood"" this shows how he was happy to find a better difiniton of family through his stay at the house ""the last way the mood was happiness is when the article said ""my mother & father had come to the contry with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture, they came selflessly"" Narciso showed happiness because that his parents made it through They're big change in their lives. This showes how the mood being created was ""happiness His Parents are wonderful people.",0
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of love, kindness, and welcome. This is true because the author uses adjectives such as passionate, warm, humble, and simple to describe how the family lives surrounded by kind people with a loving ambience. Also, the author describes how his family always welcomed others into their home and received a similar kindness back. This, CAPS1 describes, is because they consider everyone as family, which, as Narciso believes, is because of their love for each other. finally, the author explains how CAPS1 is extremely grateful to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice."" CAPS1 states that CAPS1 ""thanked them repeatedly."" This also shows how Narciso wrote his memoirs to be full of love, especially for his parents, which dictated the mood of the piece.",0
"In the memoir, the mood, or how the article made me feel, was grateful.Narciso Rodriguez wrote this memoir almost as a thank you letter.""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. -paragraph NUM1 uses words that portait the mood of thankfullness, like ""eternaly grateful"" in paragraph NUM2, or ""I will always be gratefull"" in paragraph NUM3.Narciso Rodriguez describes all of the sacrifices that were made and all the hardships lived through by his parents. He describes their coming to LOCATION1 selflessly and beginning anew all so that their children could life -paragraph NUM4.When I read this memoir, it reminded me of all of the things my parents have done so that I MONTH1 be happy- so that I can have a home.",0
I think that the mood that the author created was a unpleasnt. One beccause he lived in a one room apartment so that must mean that they are poor. and that they live in a poor town without any food.,0
"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage. Also at 1,250 ft there is a lot of wind. The dirigible would blow around the building causing unnatural stress to the building. It would be very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.",0
"Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated,      ' All of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer.     The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that heshe found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today.      Another  important reason why library censhorship is wrong is that material that one person MONTH1 find to be offensive MONTH1 not be ofensive to another. Every person has hisher own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of      CAPS1, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories  or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people MONTH1 be able to look back on these events both now and in the future.        In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrigh the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material MONTH1 be to them",0
"I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship.Different sections in the libary should be offerd.Everyone has differnt oppions on what they like to read or watch.You should do what you want at your own risk.I think the censorship should not affect the libary.      The libary should offer differnt sections, therefore a kids side, a teenage side, and an adult side. The kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group.The kids should not have to worry about censorship becuase they should not be offered any thing that an libarian would not want them to see and they should only be able to checkout things from their side of the libary.     A teen side should not have censorship because alot of kids know many things that they should not so it would not effect them as much.Books that teengers read are most likely to have foul language and inapropiate things. Teenagers when they read or see things does not really influenece them as much. Music that teenagers listen to they already know what most of the songs are talking about so why offer only censored music at libraries? Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known?   An adult side should not have censorship, adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything.Adults are the ones who see it and heard it all. It would be pointless to get rid of things on the sheleves.. They already know of allot of things. Why get rid of books that others MONTH1 read. It is a libary so it should just offer things that would increase intellegence not decrease it.     The censorship is pointless, you should do what you want at your own risk.Things in movies,books,magazines are that are of the world. Why try to block out negative things when there all around you. If someone finds something affensive then let it be there are many things affensive in today's society.You pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own. If your capable of reading it or if it is the right decision check it out.You enter the libary at your own risk and choose what criteria or selection your going to choose.     The libary is full of differnt oppions and allot of differnt likes and dislikes.If you should not be looking at something then it is your oppion to take what you want out of it. Everyone enjoys differnt things like, movies,books, magazines, and music. If the libary had a censorship they would loose allot of matrials all due to oppions of people that did not care about others oppions.Everyone enjoys differnt things and wants a wide varitey of the things they like. The libary is where you go when you need  books, movies, and etc. Why close someones oppion of  book selections, what if that is the only type of selection, or book they like to read.     I believe that the censorship should not affect the libary.The libary should offer differnt sections  for certain age groups.The books and magazinges and music at the libary should all be at your own risk to checkout them. Everyone has differnt oppions at the libary. The censorship would be a bad decison if they did go through with this decison.. The libary would not offer as many things and most liekly less things would be getting checkedout. Therefore I do think that the cenosorship should not remove books on the shelves at libraries",0
"In LOCATION1, everyone wants censorship. Mainly because they dont want be the outcast. Thats understandable in the case that we have numerous amount of different races in LOCATION1. In some ways, censorship is necessary and in other ways, some people just want attention. If all different races want censorship, then why would we censor to the liking of just one group of people?     Essentially, the censorship problem won't go away because it is a chain reaction. For example, if a group of people asked a library to get rid of books because of the references they make, that might be insulting to another group of people. then that group of people wouoldn't like a reference to another book, which another group of people dislike, and it goes on and on. So for the censorship towards different groups of people, there will have to be some tolerance.      On the other hand, young children are in need of censorship. They grow and mature everyday, developing physically and mentally. So if we were to put an inapropriate book in front of them, they would read it and accept is as standard. And when they read bad things like that, they develop the wrong goals and values for their future lives.      We are all different, and interpret things in different ways. So when you watch a movie to listen to music and think it wrong, someone right around the corner MONTH1 think that its just normal. If you question someones movie or song, in the scheme of things, your questioning their judgement, and thats unfair to them",0
"The author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she has renewed hope. She was feeling really upset because she had failed the driving test and when she saw the hibiscus flower, she got even more emotional because she misses her home but when she sees the geese as she finishes planting the flower, she decides shes going to try to retake the test next spring.",0
"Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? Im going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctors office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, thats why. The morning probably wasnt really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctors office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said I have an appointment for my son. And the lady at the front window said the NUM1 appointment? CAPS1 thats the one said my dad . Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me you know what? Youre a patient patient! I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasnt so patient , it mightve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day.",0
"The key for a long road trip is to be patient. This important because it actuly makes the trip go faster. Here is a story about how I had really great patient. CAPS5 were loading up for a three-hour drive to the CAPS1 water park in LOCATION1, LOCATION2. Everyone is in and ready to go, except of course my parents. Who went inside to check on everything, got directions, call my unlce to see if CAPS3 was ready, and all this time us kids are sitting in the car waiting. Of course my brother CAPS2 was getting antey and couldn't stop moving around until CAPS3 finaly couldn't take it anymore. ""That's it!"" CAPS3 exclaimed, ""I'm going in to get them!"" CAPS3 was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had a longer patience than CAPS3 had. Which tells you a lot?Tyler comes out NUM1 minutes later and tells us their coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another NUM2 minutes which my brother mad. ""CAPS4 took you so long?"" CAPS3 asked. ""CAPS5 had to make sure uncle PERSON1 was ready to leave."" my dad awnsered. As soon as CAPS5 got going everyone fell asleep accept for my dad who was driving. So no one really did much. At least CAPS5 were all patient, except for my brother CAPS3's still like that now.",0
"There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compasion. But, other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it. Censorship, taking books, movies, magazine, etc. off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing.       In many cases censorship is a great thing. It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age. In libraires, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying.      Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too. Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young persons head. This MONTH1 cause an effect on that child and they MONTH1 start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing.      Movies should also be censored. When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age. I barly had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of writing when I was a child. On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted. She had many of nightmares from the movies or books that she read.      Now since I am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things. In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personly been offened by some books. Although, censored books MONTH1 have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs.      Thousands of books are censored each year. Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people  have different opinions on. Libraries need to censor books to protect the iniscent minds of young childern",0
"I think that computer are a good benefit for people because those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people and even allow people to talk with other people. My first reason, is that important people around the world used computers to have a better future on life. The people that use computers have important jobs. For example, a judge, an enginere, a lawyer, an archytecht, a scientist, an archeologist etc... This is why I think that computer are helpfull for people. My second reason, is that computer could be helpful with kids because computers could help kids get better grades at school. It could help develop a smarter brain in many ways. The first way that it could help develop a smarter brain is reading a lot on the compute. It helps by knowing the meaning of new words. I helps you speak correctly and clear. That is why I think that computers help develop a smarter brain. My third reason is that it help adult connect to different places at the world. That could be a hobby for adults that does not have something to do could have a good time. My conclusion is that with computer you could have a better life. Computers could help you get a better future.",0
"The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, saeng failed her drivers test but upon reaching the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her old home. Also, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity. This combined makes her determined to complete her test because having two reminders of both homes, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and treasure her memories as well.",0
"All materials in a library are for the public. This is why we have public libraries. Children are most likely with an adult when they go to a library and are normaly looking for books or activities that they would enjoy at their age. If a costomer in a library finds a book or item that they find offensive then it most likely was not an accident. Materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because a few find it offensive.     Children are very suspicious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library. This is where an adult comes in and supervises the child. Some parents don't mind that children see these images or read innapropriate information, but on the other hand some parents do. If someone comes across information that would be offensive they were most likely looking for it and are aware of where it is. Everyone in a library has the right to take or read what they want. There is no sign outside the door that says only certain ages of people can visit certain areas of the store.      It is the parent or gardians decision to allow or not alow their child to visit the more innapropriate areas of the store. Everyone has different rules and those rules are to be followed, but it is not the libraries job to keep track and watch those children to make sure they stay in their designated area.     There is a place for everything in a library and most of the locations are pretty obvious as to what kind of information is held there. For instance, more adult and innapropriate material is located in the back of the store. Adult matter is held back there to make it more private and harder for little children to discover and to be alittle more private to people who are reading it. Childrens' books and movies are usually loctaed in the front of the store so it draws their attention more. Children MONTH1 never know what else is in the store if they dont go looking for it. Children should be acompanied by an adult if the adult believes their child would wander off looking for innapropriate materal.     Other material that could be offensive could not only be to children, it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well. Also if a person finds that information, they were most likely looking for it. Everything is labeled in a library and something doesn't just pop up out of nowhere if you where not looking for it.      Overall material in a store is public and for anyone who comes into the store. Children should be watched if they are suspicous and wander in the library. If someone does not want to find this informatin or think it would be offensive, then they should not go near the area which it is located",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles were fueled by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This danger was shown by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, and the owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of this, docking a ship there would be illegal which obviously way not helpful to the project. In the end, these obstacles were the key reasons that the endeavor failed.",0
"The library is a pathway to knowledge, which branches to many different cultural roads. It has expanded from just a place of books to a building which also houses music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media. But, there begs the question if certain materials should be excluded if they deemed to be offensive. There are many ways to approach this question.     Is censorship an answer to offensive materials or an answer to what is not 'politically correct'? Often, people will claim certain work to be unjust without understanding the viewpoint of the supposed victim. It is quite ironic that the people with the power - who stand up for offended parties - often do not understand them more than the creator of the work.      Another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material, which is very understandable. But, where in the process do parents have control of what exactly they want their children to access. I believe it is the resposiblity of the parent to determine such restrictions. If a parent gives a child unlimited access to material at a library, then the child should be able to explore wherever their curiosity takes them. If the parent chooses to limit access, then they should be active in the process of selection. It is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided.     I myself am a musician, which is no more artistic in a sense than any other creator, such as an author. My creations are expressions that I give for world to enjoy and think about. To remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts. Of course, there are other outlets to acquire books, but the library is one of the greatest outlets.     There are a couple complications that will arise in censorship on libraries. What guidlines do you have in determing excluding the offensive materials? If a material offends one person, is that sufficient enough to exclude it, or do you need a larger group? It is unrealistic to always get a complete consensus of a group's opinion, so how do you determine whats offensive and whats not.            In all, I believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library. It is an institution that is allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live. Its ability to do such should not be compromised.",0
"Laughter. Laughter is a key thing to have in a relationship. I once knew someone that had a great relationship becuse of laughter. They didnt think that they would still be together if they ddnt have any laughter in their relationship. Laughter is the shortest distance between each other because if you dont see this person, but you can sill laugh with this personand have a great relationship with that other person.  Laughter between these two people laughed all the time and they got closer then ever, even though they didnt see eachother all the time, everyday I knew that there relationship wouldnt be alive anymore if they didnt have there laughter, it means that you are happy with that person.  Laughing with somone that you care about also means that you can trust that person and you are being yourself around that person and you dont have to act how you would normally with someone else that you dont trust! I had a boyfriend that i could laugh with all day everyday and thats what kept our relationship together. We laughed instead of talking because that says how we feel towards each other, and we could just tell that we were happy with each other just by laughing. Sittin on the couch staring at each other in the eyes, then we just started to laugh because we thought of something that we had said that made us bust up and just to laugh like crazy even with out saying any words.  Even though we had our fights we would still laugh at eachother and things that made us laugh that one other said. I would be really upset and sad and he would would just know what to say to make me laugh, then i am happy because i know trhat he ares about me and cares if im happy or sad I am. A real relationship is very hard to find with a guy that can make you laugh when your really upset or mad by just smiling or saying somethings that is goofy. Even though he was mad at me he would still try to make me laugh or smile because thats what i relationship is about. If you cant smile or be happy with that person that you ""love"" then you shouldnt be with that person because you know that you wont be happy and you will always be depressed or just plan old mad at that person. Laughter is a key thing and its something that can bring your relationship closer in many ways. If you laugh with that person and you can be yourself that means that if you break up after if it didnt work then that is probably a good sign that you guys will be great friends after. I believe that laughter is something that makes two people closer and then it also is the shortest distance between two people, if you dont wanna talk like me and my boyfriend do we just sit or stand there and laugh because we knew that we could just laugh at eachother and im sure people that we were weird or something, but we didnt even care so we would just laugh and laugh all day everyday all night long. I think that if you arent even in a relationship and you guys or gals are just great friends like me and my friend CAPS1 are then you can just laugh at everything that you think is funny and just have a great time, you dont have to be in a relationship with someone to laugh with someone. Laughing is great fort the soal.",0
"Computers and the CAPS1 were a technological break through. It exposed to the average world, things that were never thought possitive. But as these things advanced over the years, they've become an addiction so bad of an addiction its begun to threaten peoples lives I've been given a choice to s'de with the addicting computers, or to offose them. The only clear choice is to offose. First off, computers have caused the world a decrease in exercise. Studies show NUM1 out of NUM2 people who use a computer, do not exercise with less exercise throughout the world, nations are becoming more over weight. This is a huge problem in the united states computers are main cause to why the CAPS2.S is over weight and unhealthy by cutting down computers use, we can get our world back into great shape we can bring exercise and health back. Nextly, I'm sure you've all heard of online predators. It's scary just to think about, well as computer technology increased online predators numbers went up. I remember a couple of years ago, I was watching the news and a story came a normal teenage girl, being killed by someone she meton myspace. things like this still go on, and the rate at which they happen are in creasing. by putting people on computers you're putting then at risk of death this is an extreme problem computers have caused. Thus is the last efferct computers have, out of many that I'm going to state time on the computer, is time taken away from family and friends.This can ruin relationship in and outside the family. Now I'm sure you now many people have become extremely addicted to online games. the more they play these games the more they pull away from everyone they knew and loved computers are a leading cause in disfunctional families. they steal the user away from the outside word. these people need to get their families and friends back. You have to act now, before its too late and computers have over taken the world. If you know anyone who has fallen prey to a computer addiction, do what you can to help get them back we need to cutt back on any kind of computer use fast. Hurry, it's now or never.",0
"This is the mood that was conveyed by the author in the memoir. The mood is a very happy one. The author looks back on all the good times CAPS1 had as a kid. CAPS1 explains how Cuban culture was a big part of his life and how CAPS1 still enjoys Cuban food and music. CAPS1 also describes how his parents made their little apartment feel like a home.  In the last line CAPS1 says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" CAPS1 also talks about how CAPS1 lived in a neighborhood with all the other immigrants from all over the world. CAPS1 describes how even though the familys from different places had almost nothing in common they'll all became very close. In the third paragraph it says, ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That quote shows how close that neighborhood was even though they came from different places. Is happy in that memoir because CAPS1 only revisits memories that CAPS1 was fond of. That was the mood that was conveyed in the memoir.",0
The builders of the Empire State Building faced two obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the forceful winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. The second obstacle was due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area.,0

"The author of the story Winter Hibiscus concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action.",0
"The author concludes the story with that passage to show the importance of the inspiration Saeng gets from the hibiscus plant. Saeng, throughout the story was comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of home. The plant during the winter metaphorically explains: CAPS1 attitude towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus plant in the winter is not as beautiful in the bitter cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Saeng is bitter about her new country and driving test, but is adapting, and will be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again.

"There are big debates today over whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive.  Plenty of arguments are made from maybe somebody's own experience, observations, andor reading.  I have read plenty of people's concerns regarding CAPS1 issue, and there are some valid points to be made from both sides of the story.  No matter what your opinion on CAPS1 issue is, there will always be someone who opposes of it.  You see censorship of offensive language on television, but here is my take on whether or not censorship should take an effect on books, music, movies, magazines, etc.     The first point that I would like to make about censorship is that people all across the world have come in contact with something that they MONTH1 have thought to be offensive.  When kids are old enough to understand what other people are talking about, they will come in contact with things that they take in offense at some point in life.  I know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored.  Although I come from a religious family who does not like to offend anyone, I am old enough to realize that not everything in life is going to work out your way all the time.  When you honestly think about it, you cannot censor out things that you hear in person, so why censor things in certain materials?     The second point I would like to make about censorship is that no matter how much you try to censor certain materials, people will still find a way to take things offensive.  There are certain things in life that you cannot control, and being insulted or offended is one of them.  Even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice.  It isn't about trying to censor every little thing that MONTH1 be offensive to some people.  Maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work i abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' CAPS1 is a quote from Katherine Paterson that makes a big statement.  Almost every well-written book that you will find on the shelf has something that should be censored.  What would those books be without those statements?     To conclude CAPS1 debate on censorship, plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship.  Many observations, personal experiences, andor readings have been done by many different people.  Truth is, there will always be people who disagree on CAPS1 subject, but that is just the way things are. We MONTH1 never know who is actually right or wrong about CAPS1 topic.  We do know though, that judging form the previous points above, it is very unlikely that certain materials will be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.",0
"As we all know, water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it we'd pretty much die. Well, it's also quit similar with laughter. I once heard my night school teacher say, ""CAPS1 is PERCENT1 attitude"". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend LOCATION1, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at LOCATION1's house celebrating PERSON2's birthday, ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. PERSON2 go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a NUM1 year-old went up to hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love CAPS3 everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before CAPS2 even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. CAPS3 starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend CAPS3 then PERSON1' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to LOCATION2, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried. Again I didnt know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and right before I could call my dad he was already outside the door. All I said was thank you daddy,with a silly smile.",0
"Do you have computer at home that you go on? Everyone goes on the computer for many different reasons with friends or for projects and CAPS5 like that. Computers can be good in many ways but they can not be. Computers are made it do all CAPS5 to help us learn. I personally think that computers are good. We can learn CAPS5 that are going on from far away. An example is if we have a big project in CAPS1 CAPS2 about LOCATION2, and we dont know the computer can look all different focus and see pictures. Computers can the history of place not us. I can sister talking how they had that has to be taken using a computer. The answer in the question world war CAPS3. She got a PERCENT1 we MONTH1 also be able to see whats going on with the LOCATION1 and different place. All you have to do for that is go on the compute and look it up. ""okay class today we will be going down in the computer to do some research."" said my teacher. ""what are we going ""CAPS4."" CAPS5 that are going on the LOCATION1. All of these CAPS5 can us research projects many other CAPS5. We can also use computers. Computers also have different CAPS5. An example at the program can help us that they let us look information, play game, help with our homework. I have just realized that you can pretty much do anything you want on a computer. CAPS2 shows that PERCENT2 of people in the LOCATION1 go on the computer for help with their. I can remember my friend telling me that she always types her essays because its for her teacher and from typing. So the program is helpful to us. people always go on the computer and love CAPS5 that are an save, at their. I usually do that so I know when a good is to an in the to buy what I want. Well you should really consider thinking about this those cant even reasons the people in the LOCATION1.",0

"Once upon a time on DATE1, I had my birthday party and my friends come over. My friend tree brought his projector over and hooked his CAPS1 to it. We played CAPS2: CAPS3 on his projector and on my CAPS4.V. with my CAPS1. Then we got bored and all of us went out into the living room with the girls and chilled and hung out for a while then we had cake, had an icing fight, and played games laughed so hard. Then we went to the park that was by our apartment. We played CAPS6 and made jokes and laughed a lot more. Then we went back to my place and we watched CAPS7 CAPS8 NUM1 and laughed at the people who screamed. Then we play spin the bottletruth or dare and we laughed a lot.",0
"Im writing about the time I was patient at a ORGANIZATION1 game. It was my birthday and my dad took me, to go to watch the LOCATION1 vs. the LOCATION2 huggets in LOCATION1. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a NUM1 ½ hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the NUM1 ½  hour drive. When we got to the arena the LOCATION1 and CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day the LOCATION1 ended up winning. That was the most best birthday ive ever had. Now I dont think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that in order. I will never forget that birthday again.",0
"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. when saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral. The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infured would mean Vietnam to saeng which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why and the geese return. is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You MONTH1 be small and fragile, but if you plant yourself you can thrive with confidence.",0

"The author concludes the story with when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed.

"CAPS2 though computers have many benefits, they also have many faults too. I believe that computers and the tecnology these days have many more negative features that positive. Some of those faults are it's bad for your eyes, don't spend as much time with family and excersising and the usage of going outside is less often used. Yeah, I get it that computers are very useful but they also kill your eyesight. If you haven't notested more and more kids have been getting glasses and contacts, due to the use of staring at a screen CAPS2 day. I know more than NUM1 kids that have glasses now, I also know that over NUM2 parents I know now have glasses for the same exact reason. Using these computers is great for looking up your homeowrk, but if you stay on it for over an hour or NUM3 a day you'll probibly become addicted to it and eventually you'd loose your eyesight. The usual time a kid spends on their laptop a night is about NUM3 or NUM5 hours and the time they spend with their family is maby an hour if the parent are lucky. Personally, I feel tecnollogy is the reason parents and kids are less connected. CAPS2 the kids go on the computer is go on CAPS3 or CAPS4 and talk to friends that they see eceryday, so I don't find their friend, mostly the girls but why not just talk to them in school since you see them for NUM6 hours everyday. The use of technology is being abused! the computers were invented for knoledge not scandeious ""webchats"" or ""CAPS4 pages."" The world would be so much happier and mentally fit if we stuck to original idea of tecnology. Now kids don't even take a faststep outside their bedroom afterschool, its pointless! Most people even eat in their room so they can talk to people. So thats taking the parents time away from their kids. Now that you have read what I had to say about tecnology now a days, wouldn't you agree that it just takes time away from your actual life? I think it does and hope that you agree with me.",0
"Based on the excerpt the builders faced many hard tasks The builders had to make sure that the mooring mast was stable enough to dock there. They also had to add on more floors on the Empire State building because the original Chrysler building added another 46 feet to still be the tallest building. Now the architects had to had the 85th floor plus the mooring mast, this brought the Empire State building to a total of 1,250 feet. The reason that a mooring mast failed was because the dirigible highly flamable and in a highly populated area like New York it would be tragic. Also nature itself with the wind were violent air current. This would cause the back of the dirigible to move around the mooring mast.",0
"Have you ever read or listened to somthing that is so disturbing that you wonder how it even got the right to be published? Well, music, books, and magazines these days are full of garbage and innapropriete thoughts that children listen to and base there life off of. All of these resources that kids can find that has this kinda of material in it can be found in libraries. We have to put an end to it or find some source of censorship for these library resources.     A library has the tendency to be known as boring or a very plain place. If a kid in school comes through the hallway saying he found a really good book, other kids become interested in it; they find out it has drugs in it and they assume that this is not a boring book like all the others that you would find in a library. Then, more and more people get that book and other books that have this style of materials are being discovered and checked out. Now, all these children with these popular books consider themselves 'cool'. So, these children start making actions and start behaving the same way the characters are in the book. This leads to disaster.     Music can be the same way. Music that has been recorded in the past ten years pick up sexual references, drug usage, and innopropriete behavior in its lyrics. Why would anyone want to put this kind of material in there masterpiece? Well singers and writers have found out that pieces containing these topics have sold the most copies. So, every artist of any kind of work is puting these references in there books or songs. Now, singers are starting to make music videos which not along sings these lyrics but shows them as well. Children see these artist in these videos with attactive mates, lots of money, and living the 'perfect life'. So, this person try doing the same thing this artist did to make there life more like theres.      Movies come along then, movies have seen the ratings go up on these kind of styles, so they start puting them in there film. Now, all these pieces have this garbage in it and has had it in it for quite some time. How do we get it out? How do we get our children to stop getting these resources? No parents want to walk around and hear there children saying these things or doing these actions. So libraries have to have some censorship on there work; there work should be removed so minors wont get the wrong message.      What ever happened to the good old days when music, movies, and art was a special talent and was not looked up to as somthing that would get our children into some trouble? We need to get these censorships in libraries and get back to the good old days before things get more out of hand than they already are",0
"I am writing you this letter to inform you that computers do benefit society. Computers benefit society because we can learn about places we want to go. It also benefits society because in a couple years everything will be computers. However, computers benefit society because they MONTH1 life easier now a days. My opinion is that computers do benefit society. Computers help everyone a lot. First, we can learn about the places we want to go to. We want to learn about the places so we can travel there. However, when we know a lot about that place we might want to but our plane tickets threw the computer site then after you get the plane tickets you can go and discover the placesplace. Second, in a couple years everything will be computers. However, CAPS3 will be threw a computer site (world wide web). We will get our education online. There will be games online. Computers do benefit society. Lastly, computers make life easier. They make life easier because instead of picking up a phone to call your friends or family you can go online to talk, they also make life easier beacuse instead of going to your family or friends house you can go on to aim or what ever chat site you got and chat threw instant messaging. In conclusion, computers do benefit society. First, you can learn about places you want to go to. Second, everything will be threw computers in a couple years. Lastly, computers make life easier.",0
"The surrounding area is dimly lit, accompanied by a fluorescent lamp shaded in the corner. Our blaring television screening an action packed, science fiction movie drowns out profane rap music escaping from my brothers headphones. Cuddled up on the couch my sister, PERSON2, and I alternate braiding each others hair. Our small kittens ORGANIZATION2 and PERSON1 race to their food and water. As always PERSON1 is superior and ORGANIZATION2 scurries up the dining room chairs, defeated. Irritated CAPS1 CAPS2 sighs heavily with frustration once ORGANIZATION2 trips his laptop charger and rips it out of the socket. Keys jingle, the door slams, speedy footsteps: CAPS3's home!   By now it is NUM1 o'clock and we have settled on the couch and everybody seat checks after snatching some food. The aroma of spicy CAPS4 food steams the entire apartment as everybody feasts on chalupas and gulps down ORGANIZATION1 from LOCATION1. Napkins are distributed and the cats linger around our feet, waiting for their share. The last bite of my chalupa is portioned between the cats, which causes a bit of ruckus. PERSON1 undertakes ORGANIZATION2! The thief in PERSON1's attitude begin to shine through as she robs ORGANIZATION2's portion. This causes ORGANIZATION2 to hiss at her, and proceed to hop onto the coffee table. On the way, she charges through the five drinks at the end of the table, managing to knock over two of them. Then the nacho cheese, being very unnoticeable, coats her striped gray paw leaving one-inch, yellow-orange circles to puzzle us. Minute but sharp white teeth are exposed and she devours the remains of PERSON2's chalupa. Raining down the coffee table are trails of blue fizzy ORGANIZATION1, and puddles gather at my feet the new suede couch. Smothered by booming laughter, PERSON2 screams at ORGANIZATION2 for stealing her chalupa. Following the escape of ORGANIZATION2, PERSON1 trots innocently behind her. My sister is still steaming angrily so in attempt to calm her down, I take off my newly ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION1-stained sock and catapult the mess toward her head. Instead of the sock slapping her in the face like I had hoped, it whistled past her ear and splashed in the fullness of my mothers stomach. Between the sock and the cats, the whole family is cracking up! CAPS1 CAPS2 reenacts the situation and his wild sound effects encourage our laughter even more. After a few minutes, the chuckles die down and we prepare ourselves for the next humorous incident.  I am freezing and muddy after a rainy softball practice, my siblings are just lounging around, CAPS1 CAPS2 is frustrated from failure of employment, and CAPS3 is weary and exhausted from a long day at work. We all look forward to what the night has in store for us: laying our busy brains on a fluffy pillow and allowing slumber to take over our life for the next NUM1 hours. Looking past our sleepiness, we can still happily spend time with one another. Considering the fact that PERSON1 is younger than ORGANIZATION2, hilarious situations such as this, amuse my family daily. Surprisingly ORGANIZATION2 wore the warrior suit this time which added a few extra minutes to the process of the hilarity. Not only that, by also the fact that it took a toll on everybody's dinner. My family is blessed with the knowledge of seeing light in odd situations. The main element in our memorable moments is laughter. Laughter is one of the few bonds our family will hold forever.",0
"I would like to notify your business that computers benefit society. Computers allow people to talk to friends and family, they are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they allow people to learn and store information. Computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology. First and foremost, computers allow people to talk to friends and family. I like to go on the computer, mostly because I'm able to speak with my friends. Computers are a good way to talk to friends that you MONTH1 not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time. I have a facebook and I always talk to my friends about events happining in school or school work. For instance, last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day. So I went on facebook at around TIME1, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. So, now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school. Also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. For example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. As you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. Secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. For example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. The programs are constructed, then corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. If people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. Also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. For example, I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. Studies show that over PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work. Computers are a big part of the working society today. Finally, computers allow people to learn about different places around the world. The computer holds a lot of valuble information. There is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries. It also shows people around the world the culture, style, language and many more facts about places around the world. For instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and see different places and MONTH1 lead them to something important one day. In conclusion, I feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. I know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer.",0

The architects had trouble with putting the moor mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The mooring mast would have stressed the building. Because of the stress from the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to strengthen and modify the whole building which cost over sixty thousand dollars. So they build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Those were the obstacles in making a moor mast.",0

Second is stated in paragraf NUM3 ""our Landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not wich shows the mood of love and happines between Narciso and Alegria with them eating together and being freinds. The last example is also in paragrafe NUM3 as it said ""countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" wich was a kal the mood of Love for ther reletives to take them in until they are on track with thier Lives.

"Coming from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State building was to be so much more. The hazards of the gases in some of the Dirigibles was a huge risk because some were flammable. Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well is the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had over looked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea. Making the mast idea out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would of had to dealt with, the mast was never built, and very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there.",0
"The author created a tone in the memoir that was truthful and grateful and pride inducing.  ""pasionate Cuban music... Filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (NUM1). The former quote was found in paragraph NUM1 described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived. The memoir created a Family love which every person longs for in life. "" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (NUM3). Anyone who can sacrifice like that for the better life of their family is a good person. That is the family love I am describing being selfless and loving to other members of your family. Another mood created in the memoir was pride in the family's sacrifice. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (NUM4). That was a quote from paragraph NUM4. It shows that you have to be thankful for the sacrifices people make for you. All of which make the qualities of a good family life.",0
"How much of your free time daily to you spend on the computer? It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of NUM1 - NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. People age sixteen to forty-eight spend NUM1 - NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this post decade, the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. Many local sports have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer. The that runs through CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online within every days. I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like CAPS3 CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating PERSON1's then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers.",0
"In the story ""PERSON1"", the mood created by the author is loving and peaceful. For example, Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing the aroma of the kitchen. This shows that the home is peaceful. Another example is, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we consider family. This shows her family is kind and loving. lastly, I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. They shows she loves her parents very much and always will. In conclusion, that is the mood wich is loving and peaceful created by the author.",0

Patience is a hard but good thing to have because patience can help you progress in your life such as getting a job.

So in conclusion patience is a good like skill to have because it can help our progress in life.,0
"I am writing this better to explain to you how more people in our society would benefit from using computer you can do work in less time it would take to do it manualy. You can interact and make more friends by talking or web chating. Not to forget that it is more entertaning. That is what computers were made for. To help us with tasks or for our personal use. How do computers though help us with work? Lets say that you are having a buisness meeting and you have to write a five page report with pictures and a graphs. It would take you twice the time to do that by hand then with a computer. With a computer, you can type you work which makes it much neater and looks more proffesional, You can copy and paste your images that you can CAPS1 on the internet. With graph making software, you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest. If you had to do this by hand, you would have to write extremly neat, CAPS1 pictures in a newspaper or mabe, even draw them. Then you would have to make the graph by hand making sure not to mess up. It makes it twice as hard, to do a simple task with a computer. What if you want to talk to a friend? With a computer you can easily talk to a friend as to having to write a letter or talk on the phone with a computer you can either chat with a person with writing or even being able to see them on you computer screen. Instead of just hearing voice or waiting two or three days to talk to them. If you have a laptop you can talk to them were every they go or you go. Being able to see the person at your convinience to talk without having to leave you house is a very good thing to have. The benifit are major and it doesn't cost anything to chat. If you have a friend or relative that lives very far away, you can easily go at talk and have a video conference. What about entertainment? The computer is a very valuable too! but we can fun, we can play games or watch videos at as convinience. They don't cost a lot to download at all, they can be played with friends on a web chat or by yourself. Videos you can watch all the time with no ads to interupt you can pause the video too. This is more efficie, they care I very convinient for the average person. Playing games were ever you go is good and again don't art to play or. In conclusion I think that people would be more from using computers this is because it is easier to work with. We can interact with each other. Use it for entertainment. Technology was made to make things easier do we should take advantage of it.",0
"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, She lifted her head. This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, when the snow melts and the geese return, this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, and this hibiscus budding she is saying when everything comes to life and is at its highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring.",0

"The computer is a great achivement of man. It is very useful for finding information fast, and has many other capabilities. Even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world. It has negatively afect to people. People aren't getting enough exercise because they are always on the computer. Along with that they are being socialy active. The lost and probably most negative effect is the exesive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life. People should be atleast taking along walk everyday. If people are sitting infront of a all day there will be much moreover people. People shold be for healthy life style, not with computers around every corner. People are also losing the ability to interact. Life is becoming dull. Every one is either texting someone. The biggest surprise is that there is online dating. This is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person. If someone think there inlove and when the cople meets the dont know how to interact, then there is a real problems. Even when you are just on the computer. You could use that time to socialize with friends and family. Last is the emerce amount of freedom that any are has with computers. There are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like facebook, but they're not cairful. They put staff like there adress and don't pay attention who how is sending them friend request. Computers have way to much negative effectson people.

"The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story Winter Hibiscus on with the last paragraph  was due to in the story the girl went out on a test. And on this test which I do not know what the test is, she failed it and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from the story, newcomers to a country. And the country is LOCATION1. Theyve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home failed. One of the things her mother asks, why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could a had the famed bee-maags which is the mothers attempt to say a Big Mac which is their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason why the daughter comes back with the plant is she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again. She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed of it and that she will make her parents proud by passing the test due to it is a high honor to the family, I believe, from what I am getting from this. In Vietnam not many people drive and that they want their daughter to earn this and it is something they do not have.",0
"Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion,gender,etc.       If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It MONTH1 be offensive to you but to another person it MONTH1 not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines,movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library.      I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else. If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out.      If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child MONTH1 learn something new from the book.      Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie,magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic. It MONTH1 help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of.      One condition on why a book,movie,magazine,music,etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it MONTH1 be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book.      The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out. If that was what happened everytime someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person",0
"In this narritive of a cyclist, riding in california, and handed for Yosemite national park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a pourch.

This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, ""had my name written all over them."" This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and ""ramshackle shed."" They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous.

It means helping others, accepting everyone, and for his parents giving up your life so your children could have a better one. He recalls the many people his mother and father help. The people in his neighborhood that were not related by blood but were still his family. The courage and selflessness of his parents leaving their country to start over.

"In the story the author concludes with When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think she did that to say that you shouldnt give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and touched a petal. She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home.

"Before my best friend moved away, we would stay up at night just laughing for no reason at all. I don't know what would get us started, but it would not stop until our stomachs hurt so bad from laughing that we just fell asleep. On these nights, her mom would come in around TIME1 and ask us nicely to please quiet down, which just made us laugh more. When we are together, it is quite dangerous to be around. We have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected.  Over the DATE1, CAPS1 and I work together, so we have lots of time to get our thinking on the same track. If we are on a short car ride and we want to go somewhere, we make it happen. We are very good at manipulating our elders, a skill acquired from years of practicing on CAPS2. All it takes is one look to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it is doomed, or very soon to be. Our schemes are generally harmless, possibly just a little side ache from being tickled too hard. It does not help that we are both small, strong, and packed full of energy, just waiting for the right person to come along. CAPS1 and I find ways to stir up mischief all around us, whether it be jumping out from behind corners or taking the manager's keys.  When I go somewhere, I am generally aiming for positive places with an upbeat atmosphere and people that make me happy. I dislike and avoid places I don't enjoy, I am one to make jokes or be sarcastic when things are too quiet or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, CAPS6 are out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together, and it lightens people's moods. Nobody likes the awkward situations where no one is saying anything, so I generally will break the silence with a blond joke or something.  I was flying home to ORGANIZATION2 from LOCATION3, CAPS3 and met a couple great people on the way. When I boarded the plane I looked around for a place to sit then decided on the seat between an elderly woman and a man who resembled my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour I will be with these people, so I had better make it something to remember. The man had helped me get my carry-on into the overhead storage, which was very nice of him. The elderly woman and I started talking, and the subject of horses came up, and when horses come up in conversion, CAPS6 are usually paired with lots of falling stories. She talked about this CAPS4 horse called CAPS4 CAPS5, how he had a mind of his own, and how he would do things his way. The problem with horses is this: CAPS6 know that CAPS6 are a slight deal bigger than us, and can really do as CAPS6 please, but most choose to listen as CAPS6 don't like to be corrected. I told about my first few rides, and how I didn't know much besides how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing in LOCATION1, and my new friends got off the plane.  When my plane landed in LOCATION1, I figured I would be flying to ORGANIZATION2 sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl got on and sat next to me. The first thing she did was offer me a piece of gum, which I accepted. The first bit of the ride was quiet, but after awhile the crying baby got annoying to listen to so we started talking. She was flying to LOCATION2 to her dad's house. We talked about our families and hobbies, and had a good time. After we flew into ORGANIZATION1, I welcomed myself back home, I was back in the eternal rain state, and couldn't see anything besides clouds out of my window. Laughter is all around us, and there are always things to laugh about, look on the bright side of life. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh, so get a sense of humor and you will be in good company. Giggles and smiles make the world go around, so keep laughing.",0
"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and gratitude.                                                            The mood was created from the words, and the way the auther described his home and his appreciation of what his parents did for him. CAPS2 was born into a simple house in a blonde-brick building situated in the CAPS1 section of Newark, New Jersey. The auther said, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" CAPS2 explained that his parents both shared cooking duties and passed on their culinary skills and love of cooking down to him. ""passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.""                                                            The auther also explained how everyone in the community helped each other and treated each other like family. Even though his parents had no knowledge of the language or culture, they immigrated to make a better life for their children. They left everything behind them. Struggling financially and personally. CAPS2 was eternally grateful for what they did.                                                                                                                                                                     In conclusion, the mood created by the auther was happiness of love and gratitude. ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love.",0
"I believe that censorship is rarely acceptable, and certainly not in libraries, at school or otherwise. Censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intollerance. Libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning. Censorship stops these things from occuring.     If people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will not read, period. Not all children and teens are drawn to reading. If there is a book that a reluctent reader shows interest in, then why would someone want to take it away? Because CAPS11 or she finds it offensive? Because CAPS11 or she does not agree with the views expressed? Neither are legitimate reasons for censorship.      Most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time. A great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics andor important works, such as To CAPS1 a CAPS2, ORGANIZATION1, The CAPS3 of ORGANIZATION2, and CAPS4 CAPS5 PERSON3. To CAPS1 a CAPS2 and PERSON1 were censored because of the racist language. CAPS12 language helps to set the time period in the novels. Also, To CAPS1 a CAPS9 is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in LOCATION1. The main antagonist is an ignorant, rascist man. The book itself is not racist, only the villian of the story.     Censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent. Preventing a child from seeing a rated CAPS10 movie or reading a letter to ORGANIZATION3 is a separate issue from censorship. I define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person. Keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading, as well.     If someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then CAPS11 or she will not be his or her own person. Living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood. They will not have their own views, and will be largely ignorant to the world around them. PERSON2 said, 'CAPS11 who destroys a good book, kills reason itself.' CAPS12 is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship; they have very little reason. Censorship can mold people, not for the better. People who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently.     These people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life. Many of these people better understand others, promoting tolerance. Censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people. Anyone is capable of possessing them.      Censorship cannot be seen as the norm. Libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow.That is the purpose of the institution of education. Therfore, censorship should not even be considered. Students' freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries",0
This final paragraph goes along with one of the main premises of the story. To not quite and keep going in order to understand and be happy in this world. Saeng is taking this test to see if shes ready to change and adapt to her new environment. She failed this time. But when all is right and the hibiscus is ready she will try again to see if shes ready to let go of the old and be happy with the new.,0
"In  rough raod ahead by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting.",0

"I think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken on the library shelves and just be put in book stores for ones own useage. Then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about like history books talking about wars, slavrey and books with curse words in them.      School libraries such as the elementry and high school should have books according to their age groups. If the libririan knows the book is not something a young kid should read then they shouldnt let them check it out. The music,magazines and movies should also be age appropiate for the age groups too little children do not need to hear cuss words every five seconds in a song.      Movies should be age appropiate too. Thats why libraries have sections for babys,toddlers,pre teens, teens and adults so if your really concerned that your child or even just your self are gonna find a offensive book or one thats not good for the age group then stay ing your own section. Lets say your a teen and theres a book that is not right for you too read and is for more older people then you should be able to tell a librarian that is there and maybe she can just move it out of that section.          Every person feels differently about whats offensive and not  offensive though so libraries shouldnt have to take out every book that offends one person cause it's not fair to the rest of the people. Besides no ones making you check out that book",0
The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.,0
Patience to me is a personal thought that turns into action. Ive been patience many times before. I use to go to the store at the corner of my block. I had to stand in a long line that actually went to the halfway point of my block. I went in got my stuff and went to the end of the line. A half hour past and it was five minutes til closing time. I get to the window and pay for my things NUM1 minute before closing time. I was actually standing in line doing nothing. The owner of the store let me get a total of NUM2 things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted and the other half was house hold things. So being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures. So start running with patience and leaving impatience behind.,0
"In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit(Joe Kurmaskie pg NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end.",0
Their were many obstacles builder face while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building. The first problem they faced was safety. Alot of dirigible especialy those from out side the unitestates used hydrogen which is highly CAPS1. So this was not safe in a place with a big number of population like down town New York to have a dirigible fly that low. It is not safe because In case of an accident there could be a large amount of deaths. The second ob stacle the builders faced was that the winds on the top were constantly blowing and could not allow the dirigible to stable in one place. Instead it would just go around and around the mast. The third and last obstacle that the builders faced was the law. There was a law that did not allow air ships to fly too low over urban areas. So It was illegal for a ship to be tied on the Empire state building.,0
"One time when my family went to LOCATION1 CAPS1, we had to wait in line for the one roller causter I sayed witch one it was. Well I wasnt as patient as my sister, but I was pretty patient. After the ride I had forgotten how long it took to get to go on the ride. My parents remember they thought we had left the park and drove off to somewhere. Well there are many other times I have been patient like the time my friend took two days to put music on my CAPS2.  She had just gotten her CAPS2 touch and she wanted to put music on it. So she asked me if I wanted more music on my CAPS2 too. Well I said yes. Even though I know I cant spend a day without using or just looking at my CAPS2. But the only thing I could do was be patient. Ok after two days she finally gave it back. I thanked her and asked what took so long. She said that the composer was taking forever and her infer were on it like forever.",0
"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon CAPS1 the builders of the Empire CAPS2 building faced many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. For CAPS3, the author said ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transnitted all the way to the building's foundation. This shows that not only did they have to designed to take the load of the building but also the dirigible. Moreover the author stated that, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether. The engineers would have to think of a way to safely dock the dirigible without anyone getting hurt In all the engineers that designed the Empire State building had to over come many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there.",0
"The mood the author created was a peaceful mood. She was bringing up good memories of her past life in her home. She was saying how she was eternally greatful for everything her parents gave her and taught her. Her parents tought her much about her heritage when she was young and kind, she lived in a very diverse area growing up there were Spanish, CAPS1, and CAPS2. There were times of racism and violence. The overall mood she created in this memoir was sad, happy and peaceful.",0
"The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng, like the geese and the hibiscus, will return again and have hope. Saeng is a little depressed in the story because she is in a new country, and just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her, but at the same time, s very comforting. Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead. Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese. Saeng knew the geese would return in the spring, just like she would to her driving test. The hibiscus would be in bloom again too to provide her with hope. This is what the final paragraph in the story winter hibiscus means.",0
"Do you ever fell like your CAPS1 is going to expload? Do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? Well that's how l felt in this story!

The story starts at TIME1pm my brother LOCATION2 just got off work and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by hiself so l was going to surprize him by walking home with him l just passed the high school and l heard my name being called so I looked around and l heard my name being called again the voice keep being called so l stoped and my sister PERSON2, and my friend LOCATION1 came up from behind me and stopped PERSON2 said ""I didnt want you to walk to get LOCATION2 by urself"" so we keep walking and savanah and me keep switching and the scooter got slower, and slower and slower because two people were riding we stoped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again and then we called LOCATION2 and said we didnt see him and it was already NUM1 he said hes at his friend house and my mom was coming to get him. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died we keep holding the power rest button nothing happened so l ran home to get the bike there was sweet running down my face and ?? none stop my legs were numb soon as l got to the house my legs colapest l got up and put shorts on, grabed the bike and ran out the door PERSON2, and savanah were already at the party store LOCATION1 questioned me and asked ""CAPS2 did it take you so long"" I told her what happened as PERSON2 pushed the PERSON1 and savanah rode on the handle bars. In my CAPS1 l was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now mad. l was they came and how l thought l was going to espload because the scooter died we put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and droped. The lesson learned is dont do something unless your foresure its happening. I learned that the hard way and I'm never going to do it again.",0
The Mooring Mast has two obstacles CAPS1 the winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other reason dirigibles could not moor at the ORGANIZATION1 law against airship flying too low over urban area. They try to get close but they can't because of forceful winds. In nineteen thirty the ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles approched the mooring but not get close. So they stablish a low to a securit for a urban Area.,0
"Censorship in libraries? Is it a problem? Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good? People of different culture, background, and life could be profound by these articles in readings. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries?     Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article that's who. If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. Some people MONTH1 take romances being offensive or comedy or horror. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of an relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows? Opinions such as these would be only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself.           People of different races and cultures MONTH1 have another opinion on the situation of censorship. From all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout. Born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a cultrue MONTH1 be difficult for some people of that culture to take in. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated. Only for others it is an oppertunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time. To support the people who made it through those heart breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life.      Have you seen protests arouse before you? Anywhere in the world? On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person. There have been protest in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race. If everyone begins to complain and argue of what is being put on shelves in libraries. What will come of our world? What will we know about the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, and even I can make observations of the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen of attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience.      Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished. I believe the answer is no, every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their life time from now on. Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without any one person's culture that there would be no history of life before us",0

That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading. That was the time when I was patient.",0
"CAPS2, I would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this letter, it means a lot to me, I am writing today because it has come to my attention that some people are saying that computers do not benefit society. Those people are very wrong! Computers are amazing! They allow easier research, I can learn about other countries, and can talk to people online. I do all of this stuff alsmost every day! We're just finishing up a pretty big research assignment for english and social studies. It involved taking a note cards from different sources. Luckily, I was able to go on the card catalog on the computer and find many books on my topic, just by typing the keyword! We can narrow down our options so easily because you can search for something so specific. After you find your topic, you can check and see if there's reliable information by reading a summary. All of this can be done in about NUM1 minutes or less.This would be nearly imposible without a computer. I have a few relative in LOCATION3, LOCATION2. A while back my family and I were trying to plan a trip to LOCATION2 to visit. We were able to go on a search engine and find directions to their house from the airport. it gave us the directions and the estimated amount of time it would take to get there. i've also been able to do plenty of research on other foreign countries at the push of a button. it's so simple and convenient, too! My two uncles live in LOCATION1. On thanksgiving my mother was upset because she missed them I was then able to set them up in a video chatroom so my mom could talk to them. this is great, its so convenient to be to go an instant message. i can talk to people all over the world and it doesn't even any money! In conclusion, computers are very helpul because you can learn about foreign countries, have easy access to research, and can talk online. there's a long list of other things that make computers great, but it would take too long to write. Thank you again for listening.",0

"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc ...,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?   Most of the people made books that are inapropiate or offensive and sometimes are the life of the person or some experience that they have live. But the problem is that a lot of people are not realistic and they don't thing that those is the live of person's and can be the future of more people.Peple sometimes like to be the best and can make problems with other and that mekes them happy that is a sad thing because that's bad and also they can get of the point of do things so bad that they go to jail that's are some of the experiences that people shows  but others get it wrong. well thats their problem they can do what ever they whant .  I know that live is not easy but thank's of that material we can have a better live and also we can deffence ourselves.  Also i don't think that they  need to be remove that books or magazines because that's what help us to have e better life and also in the future, they need to be in there and if people found them offensive just don't go there or don't see that materials ignore them more people like those and thinkthat are helpful for them and for me.   I don't think that they goin to have a bad material in there, things that are inapropiate i thing that they can't have bad or  nasty information in a place that a lot of people go and not only adult also childre's  go too. And that's is more inappropriatefor kids. People know what's going on in there and some others persons know too. the world sometimes is a danger and sometimes help us for grows up that's is a good thing but we hace the choise if we want to read or have that information.  I remember one time when i read a book that is kind of sad but that help me to know better our life it was about two boys the book has a lot of bad words and talk really bad bad olso that explain more the book and we learn more about it. that's some things that help us with life. One of the books, magazines,music,movies .etc  that we can write is our life because we pass a lot of difficults times and that is a book of our life and can be a inappropriate book of our live.people like me give the tanks to those peoples that publish they experiences and at the same time help us",0

"Hello ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries. In libraries they have tons of materials that have language and images that are offensive. i have a broad view on this subject. My view is just that if the censor stuff in a library, the should censor tv.     I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions on in our house. Everyday I see bad language thats inot censored. I also have seen images that are not censored. The youth of this time mostly watch tv than use the library. So why not censor tv. I see things on tv that i wont see in a library.     In my conclusion i would like to say i dont believe that libraries should censor their materials because the studdent will still find out. There are plenty of other places that are worse. Like crimes scenes, cime scens have blood and gore and a library would just have language. These are my views ancd yours could be differnt.",0
"CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse. I can assure you that technocal upgrades only harm our people. Email and CAPS3 CAPS4 have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills. Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills. I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used CAPS3 CAPS4 based language. CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the CAPS7 language. Furthermore, I have also observed that when my friends talk they use slang terms like ""CAPS8"" and ""CAPS9"". I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can't forget the work of CAPS10 . With the , people who should hope that they don't become a biggest loser contestant say CAPS2, but, if they continue to mind on their then they will join the millions of obese. Americans I think that when people at their computer they tend to bring junk food with them and for! contrast to this from spending these hours with ORGANIZATION2 instead of Exercising and let you creative wild would citizen rather pay for a computer or the vast, free, and gorgeous? Furthermore, people are wasting their important attention. A fact that over three of the information in isnt reliable therefore. Also, statistics show that nearly PERCENT1 of students use to. These statistics also display that when students use these sites they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly ""daunting"" task of looking for the reasearch in a textbook. What is so daunting about CAPS2? Obviously, nothing is overwhelming. CAPS2 is only pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surronding classmates won't. Furthermore, I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unrealiable information? In conclusion, the effects computers have on people are very negative. Due to this, many people have no communication skills. They are also more likely to become less obese and if that's not enough they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to dump PERSON1 and CAPS11.

"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, there were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being that the architects could not have a mooring mast on top of the building because the dirigible would be, ""... held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (CAPS1 NUM1). This would cause the building to have to weak of a frame from the dirigible's load, as well as the wind pressure. Then the stress would be transmitted down to the foundation of the building. As a result, the building's frame was modified, costing ""Over sixty thousand dollars'"" (CAPS1 NUM1). Another obstacle was designing the mooring mast, so passengers could be brought, ""... down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located"" (CAPS1 NUM3). In order for this to be completed, builders had to complete the roof. Lastly, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moor mast was nature itself"" (CAPS1 NUM4). When the winds came into action at the top of the building, the dirigible would swivel around the mast. This would cause a safety hazard for pedestrians on the street. The Mooring Mast, supported many reasons as to the obstacles builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building.",0
"Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when its the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. CAPS1 CAPS2 the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why CAPS10 wasnt back yet I didnt know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut CAPS10 orgued that CAPS4d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didnt belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into LOCATION1. Coming up on CAPS8 right came the book store and CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. CAPS3! I shouted, I dont have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  NUM1 minets till midnight CAPS8 CAPS10 explaind to me Thats impossible I told her. You can make it. CAPS4 was right, NUM1 minuets wasnt that long of a wait.

"Laughing makes you live longer. That's what I was told as a child. I think laughing is really important in life. And, in relationships. In my realationship with my sister LOCATION1, we laugh all day, everyday. And I think thats why we have most fun together. I laugh most when I'm with my homies. I remember one time I was with PERSON2 and we were just laughing so hard over nothing, thats something we do alot. I'm just a laughing person. Everybody knows that. I think when I laugh it just takes everything thats bad right now, and none of that even matters. I have this one friend namd PERSON3, and he was the kind of person that made me laugh no matter what kind of mood I was in. So because of that, he'll always be an important person in my life. One time me and PERSON2 were with this girl that was very quiet for some reason when she was with us, and I just straight up told her that she needs to talk, or laugh! or something. Then she opened up and actually laughed about the funny things. See, if your with a bunch of friends, or people that your affiliated with it's not good to just sit there and not say or do anything, just be yourself. Laugh about the things you think are funny even if other people dont kaugh about it. Who cares. Be you. I love, absoulutly love when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me it means that baby is gonna be a happy human. In movies and tv shows, sometimes I laugh. I just feel like if you laugh, your life will be way easier than just looking at the negative things. Just be happy, and laugh every once and a while.  One time me and my sister PERSON2 stole a truck, well.. We asked the guy if we could use his truck for something and he said yeah, but we really didnt use it for anything.. We just wanted to drive. And, when we started driving, we were going so fast, and blasting loud music. It was hilarious, and now everytime we listen to that song we were blasting, we just crack up laughing. So, when you make good memories and later in life think about the memories, or they get brought up somehow.. It's funny to just sit there and reminise. I could tell you a thousand stories. Heres one. One time, me and PERSON2 were living with our good friend PERSON1, and we were under his table pretending we were in a space ship, it was so, so, so, much fun! I'll never forget that time. And even when I'm writing this I still laugh about these stories. One time me and my sister PERSON2 were skating downtown, and I was trying to do this one trick, I think it was a tre' flip? Anyways, I tryed to do it and I fell on my butt. It hurt, but it was hilarious. And now everytime we pass that place where i fell, we just laugh about it. Memories are fun, every memory that I have, I laugh when remebered. One time me and PERSON2 were hanging out with some cool people, and then we left and went to this girls house, and there we turned the music up all the way and just danced for like a hour, we have a video of it. That was really funny. In the video I'm mostly just laughing.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that ""Should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. One of the problems that they faced was that many dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than, helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This factor caused that the owners of the Building to worry about the safety of the many civilians that lived in downtown New York. Another factor that the builders face was that the winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This caused problems because in landing fields the blimps could be weighted down with lead weights but that could not be done at the Empire State Building; many dirigibles would not be able to reach the Building either due to the winds. One last factor that was faced is that it is against the law to have airships fly to low over the urban areas. This ""law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" All these factors caused ""the idea of using the mooring mast for drigibles and passengers"" to disappear.",0

"There have been many times in my life in which laughter was the key ingredient. My family is always laughing. We could be laughing at a movie, or a joke someone just made. We even laugh when the jokes are aimed at us. The same thing can be said about me and my friends. My friends and I laugh at almost anything. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life, without it life would be almost meaningless. I can remember one DATE2 when my friends and I decided to go camping at a lake for a week. We all packed up our tents, sleeping bags and other camping necessities. When we got to the lake it wasn't very crowded so we had no difficulty picking a camping spot. Once we finished unpacking our gear and setting up our tents we decided to go swimming. One of my friends shouted, ""I'll race you down to the lake!"" CAPS1 took about five steps before CAPS1 stepped in a small hole the perfect size for his foot to fit in and CAPS1 fell flat on his face. Everyone started busting up laughing, it was like we couldn't stop. When my friend who had fallen finally got up CAPS1 was laughing too. We spent the rest of the DATE1 swimming and making fun of his fall, the best part about it was CAPS1 joked around too.  That night we stayed up eating junk food hot dogs and smores till we almost burst then one by one we all passed out. over the next couple days we did pretty much the same things. We swam in the lake, took hikes in the woods, fished for a little while, and made fun of each other laughing almost the entire time. On the DATE1 that we were there we all decided to wake up early and take one DATE1 hike to the top of the nearest mountain. The trip to the top went smoothly and no one fell or got hurt. The only eventful thing that happened on the way up was that one of my friends dropped his water bottle and had to chase it halfway down the mountain. To us this was funny but not nearly as funny as what happened next. Before going down we all took a ""potty break"" as one of my friends called it, the only problem with this was that one of my friends decided to pee in what CAPS1 thought was an empty hole. As it turned out the whole was not empty but home to hundreds of underground wasps. Unfortunately for us CAPS1 didn't realize this until it was too late. Wasps began pouring out of there home searching for whoever was disturbing them, which happened to be us. My screamed in horror, ""CAPS2 crap its a bees nest!"" The next thing I knew we were running as fast as we could down the mountain with seemingly thousands of wasps following us. The lucky ones had finished relieving themselves and ran away with ease, the unlucky ones were not quite finished and had yet to pull up their pants. Running with your pants around your ankles is not an easy thing to do just in case your wondering and two of my friends found this out the hard way. As they tried to run away they tripped over themselves and started to roll all CAPS1 while they were being stung by the wasps.  We all made it down the mountain with very few injuries and not too many bee stings. I remember the first thing we did when we got back was laugh till we cried. Once we were out of danger this instance seemed like the funniest thing that had ever happened. My friends and I still bring up stories about our crazy camping trip and the run in with the cranky underground wasps to this DATE1. I still think its one of the funniest things that will ever happen in my life and I am looking forward to the next crazy event. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life, without it life would be almost meaningless.",0
Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate.

"Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to dock dirigibles or zeppelins. First and foremost, a mooring mast would have to be added to the building. However, according to ORGANIZATION2, ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" before a dirigible could be moored to the mast. Secondly, outside of the United States, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas, rather than helium, as shown in ORGANIZATION2 NUM1. The owners realized that it would be quite dangerous to have a dirigible moored over downtown New York, after the German ""Hindenburg"" ""was destroyed by fire in LOCATION1."" (ORGANIZATION2 NUM1). In accordance with ORGANIZATION2 NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Violent winds, caused by air currents at the top of the building would cause a moored dirigible to swivel, and using lead weights to counter this would be dangerous over such a densely populated area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los CAPS1 could not even dock in December 1930 due to winds. Lastly, an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the mast anyway. (p NUM4)",0

This explains why they couldn't do it because of one of the dirigibles would explode in downtown New York it would cause severe damage and losses of life because it's a populated area. Another obstacle was nature. Nature played it's role because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents."" This would have made the back of the dirigibles swivel around which was either practical or safe. The last obstacle was that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas.

"Everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see. If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned?

I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that.

"In the memoir, ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, There are various different moods. The main mood is thankful.           In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez expresses a thankfull mood. In paragraph NUM1, there is an example of this thankfullness: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (Rodriguez, paragraph NUM1).    This proves how Narciso acknowledges the sacrifice of his parents, and thanks them for it. In paragraph NUM3, Narciso states that, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" (paragraph NUM3). This proves how Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for what they did for him.      In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a thank ful mood.",0
"I don't think that anything that gets checked out from the library should be censored. Some of the people that go to the library aren't looking for material with offensive language andor themes. On the other hand, there are some people who go to the library who find that having offensive language spoken when it was meant to be is better than censoring it.     Take for example a book about PERSON1. It could have some things in it that people could find offensive. But if someone has to write a report on PERSON1, it would be best to have as much information on him as possible. I will make one compromise: if there is music being checked out with offensive language, they should provide it with both a clean and explicit version of the album.     There are ways that censorship can be good, and some ways that it could be bad. Some people find bad language and themes offensive, while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author. I think that uncensoring things in the good and bad form is better than not uncensoring things at all",0
"Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library. The things they cannot read are censored. School systems have good reasons why they censor some book, and I agree with the cooperation. The facts on why books are censored in a school campus is to much racil slurs, profanity, and unaproperit situations.     How many schools have books that have racism in it. Racism happens in books all the time. In fact one out of fifty books contain racism. The big book is 'PERSON1' fin by PERSON2. It recently got banned from schools all over the LOCATION1.     People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say. Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read. Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools. It is up to the kids not to read them.     Uniproperit situations is why schools only order some sports illustrated magazines. The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scences in the books. Do you say to blame them?     I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things. It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents. I believe censorship is a great thing for CAPS1 youth.",0
"I can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the book shelf. I hope our children or any other children take this book off the shelf because it would be offensive or demeaning to the race of me or the children. This book would probably make the children asks question that we don't really want to talk about.           This book would probably be a book I wouldn't recommend for my children to read or even look at the pages or cover of the book. I mean if it wasn' t demeaning to anybody's race or skin color I would let my children read it, but if it had like profanity and racial slurs in it I would tell my kids that this book is off limits until you are older.          Certain magazines such as like swimsuit models and other inappropriate stuff my children shouldn't be aloud to look at. Music is like the magazines if it has like profanity and talks about drugs then I'm not going to let my kids listen to it. Movies are just like magazines and music, if it has inappropriate stuff in it then my kids don't need to watch or listen to it. My exception for a movie is if it is rated CAPS1 or CAPS2, then they are aloud to watch it but if it is rated NUM1 or CAPS3 then my kids can forget about watching it.      So in the end, yes I can think of a book, movie, or magazine that I don't want my children or any children to get their hands on cause you never know what that could lead to. And if your a strict parent like I plan on being don't let your kids watch, look at, or listen to inappropriate stuff because that is just putting bad stuff in their brain.      I have to admit I have watched, listened to, and looked at some bad stuff but I regret it all so very much so. There are so many inappropriate books, movies, magazines out there in today's libraries, it's bad because little kids can get a hold of this stuff and take it home without their parents noticing that they took this bad stuff home",0
"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building caused many obstacles. One of these obstacles was that dirigibles outside the PERSON1 used hydrogen rather than helium. Using hydrogen was highly flamable. They knew how dangerous it was. In the excerpt it says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle people had to deal with was nature. In the excerpt, it says that air currents were ""violent"" and it would be very hard to control the dirigible. Finally, dirigibles mooring at the Empire State Building would be illegal. It says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

"Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for childeren to get ahold of?  A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on CAPS1?  It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or CAPS1 show?  I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech.     In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, its going to bring out some violence between some people.  Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels.  That is how CAPS3 even came to be.  So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it.  There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completly.       If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech.  Some materials out there MONTH1 be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid it.  It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by.  If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything. So what is the point we all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone.  In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech.     Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was.  If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is.  So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it.  It will still be around.  It is just something in our world that we have to live with",0

"I think that their should be rooms were certain adult books are at. I think that they should have to be of age to get the books in that section.     I feel strongly that libraries should have every differnt kind of book for anyone. Everyone goes to a library so i think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books. If a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book someone of age should have to come their and check the book out for them.      I think that libraries are for everyone in a community and that not everyone reads and looks at good nice books some look at naughty books and they should have the right to go and check out books like that. When you go to a library you should be able to go their and get whatever genre that you want and their be no restrictions.      I think that the only restriction that should be made is the age limit on naughty adult books or novels and if they are very bad then they should be behind the desk and you have to be of age to get it.      My conclusion is, if you are going to look at all kinds of books they should have no restrictions on what you look at. You should be of age for romance novels and darougatory books but for the library they should have tons of books and magazines with no restrictions",0

"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our chilren or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf.'( Paterson) Katherine Paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like anyone can. That should be the right way, but I don't agree. I don't think people should be able to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive. They don't have to take the book.     I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries. If people find a book offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out. Other people might enjoy that book. Likeing a book is an opinion. For exmaple, if someone doesn't like your outfit you're probably not going to go and burn it or throw it away  because that is just that one persons opinion. That is how it goes with movies, books, music, and magazines. Everyone likes something different so their should be different books.      When you don't like a book I beleive the only time it would be right for you to take that book off the shelf would be if it was in your house. Then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book. If you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety-five percent voted to get rid of that book then I think it would be okay. You can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things, you need to think about the whole community.     I read an article about banning 'PERSON2' from schools, I didn't think that would be a good idea. 'PERSON2' was one of the top picked books by high school students. If parents didn't like their kids reading it they should have just told them not to read it. I don't think it's right for parents to just go in the school and say they didn't like that book and take it off the shelf. I t's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading 'PERSON2 PERSON2'.     Choosing what book to read is your opinion so you don't have to read a book you dislike. People like all different books so it's not fair for them to not able to read the book they like just because other people don't like the book. What If someone didn't like a book that you loved? Would they just be able to take it off the shelf",0
"I've read your article about peoples opinion on the affects of computers. I believe that having computers are a very good thing. With them we can talk to others from far away, and fast. You can learn a lot too. It also teaches hand-eye coordination. My first reason why they are good is because you ran talk to others. Without computers it would be almost impossible to meet people from far away and talk to them so easily. They even have webcams so you can see each other. You can use CAPS1, CAPS2, webcams, or even a simple comment on facebook or myspace. CAPS2 or webcams are the quichest and maybe even coolest way. Secondly you can learn Computers have so many websites that give out alot of information and resent too. It's muchn easier to get on the internet and type something in then look threw a bunch of books.The internet has dictionaries, news stations, weather, history and where you can find things. With all that you dont even need books. They even have maps and you can print out directions. My final reason is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you first start using computers your normally pretty young, and sometimes you don't always type the fastest. Computers have become so advanced that there are even touch-screen and wireless mases. So when you first start you normaly look down to see what your writing, later, adults want you to look at the screen when that becames easy you know that your hand-eye coordination has grown alot better then when you stated. In conclusion I think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that there not bad. They are an easy communication between people, help you learn, and teach good and fast hand-eye coordination in kids.",0
"You go to a library to read books, music, and magazines, but soon you find out that there are very offensive books. I strongly say yes, I agree that we should remove the books, magazines, and music from shelfs if they are offensive to people. We are suppost to feel safe reading books, listening to music, and reading magazines. When I was younger I went to the library all the time. I would get books to read and look at, and for a while I was excited to go to the library, but all the excitment went away after a few bad exsperiecnes. Remembering the names of the books are not going to come to me, but I know I was so upset by how the book was. It had words that I never heard before, and I got confused. This could happen to many little kids that come across a bad book, but really librarys should only have good books not bad.After that bad experience happened to me I ignored it like it will go away or something. Bad books, offensive books, should be taken off shelfs for good and never to return. I feel very strongly about this subject, because I am a book warm, I love to read books and being able to go to a library and find a good book thats not offinsive is all that I ask for in a library. Offensive books, music, and magazines should not be aloud to be in librarys at all. When kids read books or listen to music they want to be able to disappear in them, but if there are offensive stuff out there, how will they be able to do that. There are things that should be left out of libraries and that is offensive books, music, and magazines.In closing to my essay I still have full curage in my answer, I still say yes, they should remove the offensive books, music, and magazines. If it was your sister, your daughter, or your neciece that went into a library and found an offensive book, what would you say? I ask you this, how would you feel?",0
"When people think of a library they think of a quiet place to study and read. Teachers use the libraries for many different things. One thing they use it for is movies on certain topics. Another is for books on certain people or events. They even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up on the world outside of school. So what is my opinion on offensive materials getting removed? I'll tell you what it is.     Kids watch movies in class all the time. Some are not appropriate at times, but some are very insiteful and helpful. I think if the teacher watches the movie first and thinks that it is too bad for children in say elementary it should be banned from that schools library, but for high schoolers chances are they have heard or seen worse. So with saying that movies should stay in the libraries of high schools but not all should stay in the elementary's.     Books are another good resource if used correctly. They help kids in history learn about old war hero's and past events. Some books should be kept behind the counter and only used for certain classes though. Like for instance books that tell specifics about drugs. They should be taken off the shelves , put behind the counter; and if someone really needs a book about them like for medicine purposes to become a doctor then all they have to do is ask.     Magazines are good for a couple of different nice things. One thing is projects. If you have to do a project over something like food and cant use a computer, magazines are a great way to get good pictures. Another thing its commonly used for is just flat out entertainment. Like when you get bored of reading a book that you just picked out because of looks or if a book is too hard to read you could get a magazine.     So in reality some things should be kept and others taken away. People spend lots of time in the library for many different things and that will never change. Movies are a good source of entertainment and that won't change either. So I guess i'm half and half on keeping or getting rid of offensive materials.",0

"There are alot of things that u can find in the libraies that you can find to be inapporite to some but not all people. if there was something that i was ofined by then i would ask them to pull it off the shelf. if u have somewhat of a project to do then go to the libarie to meet some friends and work on it there. If you need help to finding a book for your project ask the person at the desk where to find it. The libarie is here to help those that dont have a computer at home, they can go to the libarie and do there work there.               If they would have alot of there books on a disc or dvds,movies,tape players alot more people would want to read more. If that all libarie had all the same books  then they would have more people in and out getting the book they want to read. if there was little kids that want to read kid books then they should have a section for them. All the libarie should get ride of the inapporite books that some of the people right off the shelf so that they dont have people complaing about the material on the shelf.     Theres probale about NUM1 to NUM2 libarie in the LOCATION1. I know for fact that there something inapporite on the shelf in all ther libaries. There are tons and tons of books in all of the libarie so theres a good chance there something out there that someone will find they dont like and ask for it to be taking off the shelf. if they would get alot of people saying they are offenied by it then they would have to take it off.     There is also alot of magasins out there that some should be seen to little kids. if they get on that talks about drugs and some other things they could be offensive by that. all magasins should have some what of a rating on them. you would have to be older than NUM3 years of age to get a pg-NUM3 mag. some of the magasins should be for little kid that go there all the time and adult. they should have them divid into sections for little kids and adults. They need to respect all the people in the libarie at that time. I think that theres some of that here in are home town but not PERCENT1 postive there is.

"No, materials should not be removed from the libraries.First most of books,movies and,music are the best way to support difffernt things.They all have there type of way of convinicing you.There are many different ways to understand but those are certainly the best ways.                          Like a movie some people like to see things to understand them.Because it take times for some people to see instead of reading or listening.It take people to just seat and watch is a great way.Some people that look at a movie an a wrong way get the wrong type of thought about something which make it offensive to them.

"Do you think that books, music, magazines, movies should be removed form a libraries shelf?     A libarys should carry every kind of book, movie, Magazines, Music etc.  The reason that a libary should carry every thing is because say a farmer wants to come in and get a book over cattle and some city person says that its no use and throws it away the farmer is outta luck or say the oppiset would happen.  Another reason would be a persons tasted some people like romance and some like action etc so if they dont carry one type someone will get mad about it and stop going. Say if PERSON2 dose not like viloence so they take it off the shelf and PERSON1 dont like chick flicks etc what would that leve in a libary no one would have anything to read and they would close the libary down because there would only be a few books.  The movies and magazines i would say carry anything that was approperat and if it was rated CAPS1 you had to be NUM1 to rent it then the person would be a adult. There is different cultures out there that only like certon thing so what are they going to do make seperate libarys so that each culture will be happy or just build one big libary and the ones that dont like just leve the book or whatever there.  Altmentley its up to the parent to tech there chiled noy yo pick up the bad items if there not liked by a certin family or cultuer.  If they would get rid of the stuff one person didnt like it would loss custmers and make others mad so in my eyes its better to have one person mad becaues a libary carryes a certian type of item then to loss custmers and make NUM2 people or even two to make one person happy when it is as simple as dont pick it up.     So altimently we can not make everyone happy so just look over the items you do not like teach your childern not to bring them home and move on in life and dont start a problem",0
"People should not take all the books out for the librarie. Beacuse other peolpe would probley like to look at those books also.  If people start taking books out, all the book  will be gone .So  that would mean  where would be no books form people  to look at. So thats why there should be a law that you can only have a book out for a given period of time . That would help to kept all the books in the liberary.      So if people just start talking the book for the liberary there wont be any book left in the liberary to check out. So there needs to be a law that says that you can check out a sarthen numbers of books at a time. And how long you can have the books for . If you dont bring the books back in a certain amount of time you will be charged. The amount will build up every day you dont bring ther books in. Also if you dont bay the bill you dont get to check out books until you bay the ammount. So that would be a good idea for people not to steal or take the books.     About the Book, moives, and magzines  that are the liberary.   All the books ,moives and magzines should stay on the shelves. Because if you take out one you should take out all off them. Beacuse every one needs to see  these thing in life even if it has some thing bad like a  movie  or a magzine it should stay on the shelves.     So if a book,magzine,or movie gettes taken off the shelfes all of them need to be taken off the shelf .Just becauseit not fare to there author , beacuse they toke time to make what ever they did. If you get them mad thill stop making book for me and you to read.     So thats what I think about the things you should do if you try to take books off the shelf in the liberary.But if its some thing really really bad mabey you should get it taken off the shelfs at the liberary or at any where they sell that book,moive and magzine.",0
"I just wanted to say that I do I agree with you that some people spend a lot of time on the computer. My reasons are that people need to exersize, go out doors. And have fun. If you keep reading you'll understand why they need to do theis things. My first reason was exersizeing. And the reason why I say exersizeing is because you don't need to be on the computer all day long. So many things that they can do, is run, jog, and go for bike rides.

My second reason was going out-side and the reason for that is because people need to get fresh air and not be locked inside all day. Another one was to explore and go on a hike to see what is out there and just have a good time. My other reason was nature. And what I mean by that is you can go to the zoo and learn about stuff there to. Another thing is that you can do much more with out being on the computer all day long. My last reason was you can talk to your friend about stuff, you can go to the mall all day, you can also hang out with your friend and have a sleep over and watch movies. You don't need to stay on the computer all day you need to have fun. This is why I say you don't need to be on the computer. You can do other stuff and still learn with-out being on the computer. For once maby insed of talking online you can actultly go to your friends house and talk. Thank you for your time. Hope to talk to you soon.",0
"CAPS1 opinion on the effect of computers are that, it depends on how much you use the computer. But I think the computer has a possitive effect on people. Why because it has made us kids homework easier to do, and fun sites you can check out. Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer. First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes CAPS1 homework easier, instead of getting it from a book I can get it from CAPS1 computer. Trust me it's much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer. Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to right about PERSON1 LOCATION1. All you have to to is go to CAPS2.com and all types of past CAPS2 would show up. Then you go to search and put in LOCATION1 then all this CAPS2 of him comes out. So you get the right information that's an easy A+ for you. Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on youtube, or myspace. It's alot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For, example, say you don'CAPS3 want to play your game or watch CAPS3.V, or go outside. What do you do, get on your computer. So you can check your myspace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can'CAPS3 do none of those things on your CAPS3.V or your game and especially not outside so that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers. Half of every adults job has an computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientist to look up different experiments. For example a teacher alway's have to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are. So it makes it easy on adults as well. In conclusion, those were the reasons why I think computers has a positive effect on people.",0

"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects faced many problems. One of these problems was the buildings frame. The frame needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new mast. Another huge obstacle was safety. In paragraph NUM1 the author states, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to go up in CAPS1 not only the passengers would be in danger but everybody on the crowded streets below. The winds at such a high altitude also posed a threat. Paragraph NUM2 explains that the violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel all over the place, making it hard for passengers to unload. These were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.",0
"I am neutral on this subject because it does not matter to me whether they put new books, movies, music cds, or magazines on their shelves or if they take them off. Also it does not matter to me if I have to pay for the things that I check out from the library. Also it does not matter at all if I had to pay a late fee for the books that I checked out from the library. Also I do not care about any noises that go on in the library.     Also it does not matter to me what kind of books they have in the library. Also it would not matter to me how the library is run. Also I would not care if I had to be quiet in the library it would not matter to me. Also I would not care how long that I would stay in the library.     Also it would not matter to me if I walked or drove or rode my bike to the library. Also I would not care if the policy in the library was not the right way to run it. Also if I got kicked out of the library I would just go to another one. Finally, it would not matter to me if I got ten books or movies from the library I would not care.    Thoma",0

"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders ran into obstacles that in the end prevented the whole idea from moving on. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (NUM1 line NUM2) because of the changing winds atop the building there would be no safe way to moor a, lighter then air, dirigible on top of a high building. The wind also posed another problem because if the captin let go of the controls the dirigible might spear itself atop another pointy sparer, thus leading to the other high buildings to be an obstacle. The Law of the day also became an obstacle ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"" (NUM3 line 1) the building itself was high up but even at the top it wasn't legal for any airship to moor due to hieght restrictions. These attempts at building a mooring dock atop the Empire State building would have sent to New York spirling up ward to being in the land inovation but the obsticles were to great to surpass.",0
"The mood of the memoir is very upbeat, happy mood of how PERSON1. Grew up in Newark, New Jersey in a very Cuban family and tells the story of how Narciso went through his childhood.

"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome.",0
"The mood created in the memoir was very greatful because of PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey.

"whom MONTH1 concern; Local Newspaper. I belive you are right. Computers can be helpful, let us chat with people but we dont exercise. Forget about family and most importantly yor health their vision gets bad, they eat more junk foor and that can lead to bad cholersterol. High blood pressure and even diabities. A computer is very addicting people stay up on it for hours.

Not being with the people you love not doing any activities you people need to get off that computer and do more in your life for. A computer is like a drug but do it for your family and listen to my point of view so I think all computers should be banned for at least one week to look up on work or school and maybe even your health. This MONTH1 seem like were overacting on this but we really arent. Do you want population on people having diabetis and other causing affects that can happen to your body increase.

"Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasnt. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening. With ""a DATE1 ft dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph NUM1). Also one of the greatest obstacles as the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. Also, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships of flying low over urban areas which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. This sounds like a great idea and a great way to get more tourists, but there are too many obstacles to make it realistic.",0

"'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. This quote says it all, if everybody had their say in what is offensive or not then everything would be offensive. Books are often written for the enjoyment of the reader, and if not that books are for informational purposes. Not everybody will have the same views of one book as someone else does, so it would be unfair to not be able to read it because someone else doesn't want you too.     Personally I like to read books that interest me, as i can assume most do everyone else. Generally to keep my attention, I like to read books with a lot of action and an intense plot. I realize that some people would find this offensive and not acceptable for children, but I consider myself a good kid now and I am not negatively affected by those books I read. When I was a kid in NUM1 grade, I read a book far beyond what most NUM1 graders read. This book contained many vulgar words and even a racial slur, but I was mature enough to handle them. Just the other year, the librarian, whom I stay in constant contact with, asked me if she should take the book off the shelf. I told her no, with my reason being that I found it to be a very interesting book! I would have been upset to see a great book no longer be accessable because of some vulgar language, because what it comes down to are just words that express heavy emotion.     Many books such as, the dictionary or encyclopedia's are used for informational purposes. These books can also be accessed by children. I myself as a kid have looked through the dictionary looking for 'bad words'. Does that make it jusitifiable to remove? Even the books we read in school today have 'bad words' in them. When I was a freshman in high school, my CAPS1 teacher talked about how the school board tried to get rid of 'To CAPS2 A CAPS3', because it had racial slurs and much racism involved. She was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very interesting read for her and her students. Books just can't be taken out of the hands of high schoolers because some uptight adults think it is offensive, when in all reality they teach great morals and lessons for the youth.      If you take a look at politics you can see that not everybody has the same opinion and some can be very vocal about their's. The same idea can go with any topic in the world today. Somebody thinks one way and someone else thinks the complete opposite. This is the issue with taking books off the shelves. One person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book. My personal opinion is that a book is a book and people are going to interperte them differently. So if one book can get taken off the shelves then this will just start a chain reaction until every book is gone. There is no point! If someone shouldn't read that book then they shouldn't be allowed. The answer is as simple as that.     When it comes down to it people are just going to have to get over not having their way, because they want a book removed from the shelf. Most people are offended by something and usually not everybody is offended by the same thing, which makes this issue impossible to deal with. There is only one answer to this question of: Should the library be censored? The answer is no, just let it be. The book was published so there must have been a good reason behind it. In the end of it all a book is just a book",0
"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The blue prints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso explains the mood of his home.

It gives you this sense of a warm family.Another way is in paragraph NUM2. He says ""My parents always Kept their arms open to the many people we considered family"". This gives a loving and caring feeling. It also gives the sense of family.The last way Narciso explains the mood is in paragraph NUM3.

Lastly, it ties up CAPS1 feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, ... I will take the test again (Ho NUM1), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot.

"Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library?  Several people would agree, but I disagree.          Growing up, PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of there freedom.           You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track.          Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.           Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set. It would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether. Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media",0
"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a specific mood created. The mood is proud, because the author goes on about how amazing their parents are & how inviting the house was. In the memoir it says, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The author talks about how hisher home was full of Cuban culture and how great Cuban food is. The author also says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author is grateful and proud because her parents welcomed with open arms people of all types. The author was also proud that heshe was so close with neighbors that they were like relatives. This is why the mood created in the memoir is proud.",0
"I am patient. Even though I hate being patient, I can usually tolerate it. Like when I was NUM1 and there was no school because of so much snow, my mom had to go to a meeting out of town so she took me to my dads house. She forgot that he had to work DATE1 from NUM2 am to NUM3 pm. It was too late. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of autozone. So I stayed back in this little office (which I MONTH1 add has never changed, even NUM4 years later.) and I was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just walk around doing nothing. that is until I found NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I shuck onto the bottom surface and held on. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about NUM5 hours and still had almost NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I would CAPS1 have touched it. But I did. I was only NUM1! I dont really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because its implanted to my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun??",0
I waiting  I was looking forward staring at the silent audience. Yet I couldn't really see that well since the stage lights coming down on me were quite blinding. I stood next to my best friend CAPS1. On the other side of the stage was our competitors PERSON2 and CAPS2. As I kept staring forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while  PERSON1 kept talking. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pair and write a story about anything we wanted. CAPS1 and I looked at each other and shock are heads yes. Later that day I rode my bike over to CAPS3 house and thought about what to write. PERSON1 also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited almost jumping up had down excited because I love writing and competition. I jumped off my bike and ran to CAPS1 already shouting out ideas. Finally we decid on something to write about. It would be an adventure story and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. Br the end up the weak we had ten pages wrting written down.i went on my acer and type  th e ten page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day it was tie between CAPS2 and PERSON2 and CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another compition I ronaly PERSON2 pair and my pair won again! I really hope we don't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage still staring at the audience all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. CAPS1 told me to have some patient so I did. After twenty minutes of judging the presdent came up and said PERSON3 and CAPS1 have won first place. We jumped up and down and got on trophy. CAPS1 and we found at that hard work and patience can really lead to something great.,0
"Patience is usually good or bad for me. Here are a few reasons why patience can be hard or stresful. If you are waiting to get a shot or life threat results. A way to avoid normal patience like being board is to get some notes or school work to do or an ipod. Patience is everywere. For example carrides, birthday parties, vacation commercial, school being over, restaurants, holidays or whenever you say I cannot wait, and etc. to sam up a few ways about patience in my way of description.",0
"Censorship, only for the light hearted.      We have had this issue for as long as man can remeber. Since we were only little kids to adults. Everything was censored. Bleeps on the television to hide harmless words to random letters in curse words as if we did not know for example what NUM1k spelt. I agree, censorship is needed for a certain period of time, but when that time goes on for to long and even in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle, that's when it goes out of hand.      I am a highschool student and even I have to say limiting our reading because a book might have one or two bad words in it is just redicoulous. Its the most hipocritical thing to do because even science and anatomy books show certain parts of the body like genitalia but thats okay because its in a science book. However if its in a normal book, everythings a big deal and we can't handle it big woop. I say its a library, let us read what we want to read.     Like i said before highschool is where the maturity hits and the censorship should be lowered. Im not saying just completly take it away but come on now I think highschool student can handle a few bad words in an outstanding book.      As far a movies and music go, anything pornographic or just plain idiotic and demeaning should ofcourse be censored, but if theres just a few bad words why should that stop an entire school from enjoying some good music and possibly an amazing movie.      So the point is, let there be censorship, but only to the point where people wont just take away music and books from us highschoolers for a few bad words. Censorship is for the lighthearted, and nothing is stopping the lighthearted people from not picking up that book with a few words in it they don't like, just dont read it. Thats all I have to say about censorship.",0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it adds the uplifting message that Saeng will be able to overcome the obstacles of living in an unfamiliar country. First; the CAPS1 geese represent a piece of her new home because she reasons reluctantly that they are familiar to her now, This depicts her ability to adapt to her new environment. In addition, she also equates spring to when the habiscus is budding and the habiscus is a symbol of herself because both are trying to live in a country that is not their own. Therefore, the habiscus budding represents her being able to live comfortably in LOCATION1. Finally, she vows that she will take her drivers test again. Her intial failure to pass the test showed her inability to become a part of LOCATION1, but if she passes it. Then she will have successfully adapted. Overall, the author of this stoy concludes with this paragraph because it contains the theme of the passage through an uplifting message.",0

"The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronaumical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are to many obstacles prohibiting it.",0

"It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. If CAPS1 is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. There is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. CAPS1 must learn in order to teach. CAPS1 must teach for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden.Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect.      If CAPS1 were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. It is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. It seems that the time of research is diminishing. CAPS1 can only learn so much from a world history textbook. It MONTH1 not be completely accurate. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. With such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The hidden information could be helpful. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: CAPS1, CAPS2, CAPS3. They are gone. At any moment, anyone and everyone could die. Time is mainly all we have. We need knowledge to make the most out of it.     Everyone deserves to be heard. If CAPS1 were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material MONTH1 be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himselfherself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all CAPS1 can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard.     Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it.",0
"In the memoir the expressed different moods. One of these moods were appreciative, he was appreciative that his parents made a house into a home. They made him happy by the way his parents passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking and their passionate cuban music which filled the air of his home. The author also expresses how he is grateful that his parents left their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved so that they could come to america, start their life over, have a better life for themselves and himself.",0
"It was the first day of the ninth grade, that terrifying day when one must choose how they are to be percieved for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like a hippie on steroids, just over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds of long haired, freckled teenager. I was a giant, and that made it difficult for bullies to muster up the machismo to treat me as the freshman that I was. I sat down in my designated seat, next to one of the girls I could tell thought too highly of herself. Despite this off putting first impression, I atteampted friendship. My atteampt was met with confusion and disgust.  As I turned to face the front of the class once more, there stood the teacher. PERSON1 announced that our first assignment was to create a presentation, one that would show the rest of the class who we are. I was excited at the prospect of a presentation. I have always been a showman, and the limelight is a very dear friend. I love to act, sing, and in general entertain. My crown jewel however, is humor. I have found that I can captivate an audience no matter the number, with humor. With this I designed a presentation to entrap and engage my class in the reality of who, and what I am. I wrote a speech in which I explained my talents and the many things I enjoy. In this speech were many twists and turns of phrase, punchlines and puns. There was such laughter that other teachers came to see what was causing the noise.  I took a bow and sat in my seat, looking around at the shining faces of my new friends. I knew then and there that laughter would be the tool with which i would build my highschool life. I could make someone forget about their troubles for a spell, or brighten someones day with a few words. I wasn't a star athlete. I wasn't even a star pupil. But I seemed to collect friends like I was made of fly paper. There is no better feeling i have yet felt, that compares to the company of friends. As long as i have humor, I shall never be without that feeling.",0

"Censorship in libraries is not necassary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive; then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids MONTH1 refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to. Censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books.     Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away.     If there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of; keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids. It is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad. That is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different. So again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves.     When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids MONTH1 just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories MONTH1 seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids MONTH1 actually read.     All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss. Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the gurdian of a child",0

Like when they said , tomble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake. CAPS1 her example would be when they said Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing.

"Some people often go to the library to check out books,movies,magazines,etc..But what some people might not realize is that some of the things that they have at the library might be offensive towards certain people. I think that everything thats in the libraries should stay there. Obviously the library allowed it there for some reason. So honestly it cant be that bad.          I do not think certain things should be removed from the library. People have to realize that that's life. There's going to be certain things that you dont like but you have to deal with it. If you watch tv you'll notice that there's some offensive things towards certain people. But no one really makes a huge thing out of it.               The books might be offensive to you but to someone else it could just be another book that they want to read.With no intentive purpose of offending anyone. The library is all about learning. Everything is for educational purposes. I've read books that I stopped and thought about for a second while I was reading it and noticed that theres some pretty harsh things in it. But i didn't complain about it, I just kept reading.            Alot of books are based off of true events so no matter how offensive they are to people, you just have to think what the purpose was for the author to create this book and same thing with movies. So people can see what the author has to say. Everyone has the right to have their own opinion. And thats what most magazine articles are about. Expressing what you think about a certain topic.          Even in the CAPS1 class that im in now we had to read 'To CAPS2 A CAPS3'. Some CAPS4 CAPS5 people might think its racist but it reallu isn't. The author is trying to get his point out. Of how things use to be before white and colored people were treated the same. Now if you still think that is being offensive towards you or other people then thats alright. That's why this is a free country. Everyone has the right to say how they feel and not get in trouble for it.          So I hope i got the point across that it's alright for some things to be offensive towards people. As long as thats not the whole point of what you watching or reading. Which i doubt it is. So next time your reading or watching something that is offending you. Think about the point that the person who wrote or made the movie were trying to get across. Mybe by it offending you it is getting the point across.",0

"There was many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a lot of dirigibles outside the LOCATION4 use hydrogen over helium. The problem was hydrogen is highly flammable, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densley populated area such as downtown New York City.""

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with dirigibles. The first being that with the large size of the aircrafts it would put much stress on the building and so a new frame was created to accomadate the NUM1 ft dirigibles. Sixty thousand dollars was needed for modifications. Another problem was safety. A lot of dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accident like in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavely populated New York a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. In open fields weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" CAPS1, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. The Empire State Building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. Those are obstacles the builders faced when building the Empire State Building.",0

"The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didnt get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge, By the lols of it had been a Welchs CAPS1 CAPS2 Factory. He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth. There is only the problems it is abandoned.

"I always wished that I could go back in time and relive CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. Looking down on CAPS7 little cousins or brother, I see joy, and laughter, and silliness. I see innocent soft faces who have no idea nor understanding for what is going on around them. As I watch them slowly grow out of their unusual habits, I find myself back CAPS4 the year DATE1. A little girl, not in school yet, runs in her grandmother's yard on a DATE4's mid day. She flops her pig tails back and forth while hiding her hands in her size NUM1 trousers with one eye closed and the other slightly opened watching her older sister run around looking for a place CAPS4 hide.  ""CAPS1, nine, eight, seven..."" ""CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4 CAPS5 CAPS6!"" CAPS7 sister, PERSON1, yells out CAPS4 me from behind one of the giant oak trees.I giggle CAPS4 myself a little and start at CAPS8. ""CAPS8, four.. three.. two.."" I slow down dramatically, ""ONE!"" and like a rocket, I blast off the front porch with CAPS7 arms spread out on each side, making engine noises, and pretended I was a pilot ""CAPS9 on lock! Mayday, mayday! CRASH!"". I tackle CAPS7 sister CAPS4 the ground. I remember the look on our mothers face as we lay there rolling around in the grass laughing. I closed CAPS7 eyes and reopened them CAPS4 find myself in DATE2. It was a few days after the tragic happening of NUM2. Everyone met at grandma's house as always, kids in one room and adults in the other. I was playing in our small ball pit with the two youngest cousins, PERSON2 and ORGANIZATION1, when we noticed that there was a small hole in the wall. ""CAPS6, look through."" PERSON2 demanded.I took a deep breath and did what he asked.  ""CAPS11!"" I yelled The little hole gave us a vision of what was happening in the room next CAPS4 us which held all the parents and old people with straight looks and serious tones. I let the little ones have a look, they didn't find it as interesting as I did but they wouldn't give me another chance CAPS4 see. I pushed CAPS7 way through. All three of us looking through something so small. We kept giggling, and talking. We did this for about CAPS1 minutes, not knowing that our uncle was watching us for at least CAPS8 minutes. He motioned the other adults CAPS4 see what we were doing. One by one, noticing that the amount of people in the next room was decreasing. Soon, there wasn't any of them in sight. ""CAPS12 did they all go?"" We panicked.Light, quite laughing was going on behind us. PERSON2 looked toward ORGANIZATION1, ORGANIZATION1 looked at me, I looked down CAPS4 PERSON2, and at the same time we turned around and saw everyone smiling, laughing, and taking pictures of us. We stood still with red faces and soon started pointing fingers about who gave us the crazy idea of spying.  After that, it was like any day with family; everyone in the living room, food in the kitchen, warm hugs and kisses from grandma, people pinching CAPS2 cheeks, big smiles and long loud laughs. I see friends shaking hands and kids yelling and screaming, people telling they're loved ones ""I love you"". I look down at CAPS7 feet and with a blink of an eye, I'm back CAPS4 DATE3. I raise CAPS7 head up over CAPS7 shoulders, see that I'm in grandmas living room babysitting the kids. I'm sixteen this year, and I don't believe that there is one day when I don't laugh. Of course I can't laugh when it comes CAPS4 all seriousness , but other than that, laughing is part of humoryouth. When someone tells a joke and you think it was funny you don't just stand there and say that was funny and not laugh. Everyone knows that, once in a while, they have CAPS4 take a step back and laugh. I always wished that I could go back in time and relive CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. I had no desire CAPS4 impress anybody. I lived CAPS7 childhood well and when I think about it, I just sit back, look at everything that I have done, and laugh.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building had a few obstacles to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted in the,The Mooring Mast. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, didn't want his masterpiece to be only for show, so he gave it purpose; a dock for dirigibles. By adding a comma ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" the buildings frame would be under much stress; ultimately making the structure unsafe. To alter the frame and wind pressure, over MONEY1 would need to be accumulated. If an accident were to take place, like in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be in grave danger.

"In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be romoved or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable.      In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate. We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want. These books MONTH1 have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual jestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin.      There are many types of music out in the real world. Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite. In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it. There are different cd's, cassate tapes, or even records, that you can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio. You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on.      Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes. Whether it's PERSON1 on the front page with no hair, or LOCATION1's next top model. Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents MONTH1 not want their kids being exposed to NUM1 actions. Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottory. You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely.      People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it. Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate. This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it. If you don't want to hear it, don't listen. If you dont want to see it, don't buy it. Its quite simple",0
"I agree with the experts that people spend to much time on the computer, people should be exercising, reading, or spending time with friends and family. But people are so lazy and would rather be sitting and doing something on the computer and if they dont start doing other things instead of being online they could become overweight. My first reason why people should spend less time online is because people need to exercize. Seriously people should be taking walks around the block or going to the gym or even playing a sport instead of playing on the computer all day and doing nothing and without exercising you will become overweight and lazy. My second reason why I think people should spend less time online is because you should be spending time with your friends and family not ignoring them because your doing something on the computer. Thats just rude, so why dont you go and have a family game night or go out to eat with your family and you could also watch a movie, go skating, or even go to the park with your friends because thats a lot more fun than being online all day. My last reason why people should spend less time online is because everyone should have time to just read a good book honestly just walk down to your local library and check out a book because reading is way better for your brain than doing stupid stuff on the computer. So in conclusion, in my opinion I think people should spend less time online is because if you dont get enough exercize you can become over weight and lazy, and not spending a lot of time with your friends and family is just rude and reading is very good for you unlike staying on the computer, well that is all I have to say for now.",0
"The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It show a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has. This ending also shows how much of an effect the Winter hibiscus had on her. with bringing back memories of her old country. If Saeng wouldnt have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home.

"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a very warm peaceful and interesting mood. The way the author described the way she used to live looks like she lived a very loving and peaceful enviroment. She also creates a spanish theme to it which I could relate to. For example in paragraph NUM1 she says she is very passionate for Cuban music and she's grateful she know how to cook. She also said in paragraph NUM2 she will never forget how her parents turned a simple house into a home. That quote makes the mood of the memoir loving.",0
"Keep it on the Shelf!     What types of things do you go to the library for? Some go for books and others go just to relax in a quiet environment. Yes, the library is mostly used for books and studying, but there are many other things that libraries contain. Movies, magazines, music, etc., are all found in a library. Now, say you had to listen to a specific song, read a certain book, or review an article in a certain magazine, and you can't find it at the library because they have been removed because they are found to be offensive. All people have different views on what is and isn't offensive. Everything like books, music, magazines, and movies should all have their place in a library, regaurdless of the material.     Books can be used for many things. Some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things. Books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately. What if you can't find that book because someone said that its material is inappropiate? What are you supposed to do about your research paper now? If a book is needed it should be able to be found on the shelf in a library and not be taken out because of the content of its pages.     Music is a great way to clear your mind and relax. Some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people. What if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library? You walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive. Now you can no longer listen to the sounds that calm you down or modivate you to get your day started. Music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store.     Magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library. Magazines are a great way to stay up to date with the latest fashions and great dessert receipes. Without magazines our world wouldn't be able to keep up with the things that advance in our world everyday. Magazines show us the hottest trends, the gossip in the celebrity world, and some great facts from educational magazines. Without the magizines in the library we probably wouldn't know anything about our advancing world.     You can find movies anywhere, but some believe that you can only find the really good and old movies at the library. The library has educational movies for children that MONTH1 not be available anywhere else. They also have old classic movies that aren't even around anymore. The library has many movies that you wouldn't be able to find in our advanced world today.     Libraries hold a lot of important books, movies, music, and magazines. Without out most of that, regaurdless of the material, we probably wouldn't know as much as we know today. The library has always been a place where you go to find exactly what you want and you know that they will have it. Removing these things from the shelves can be taking some history right out of our lives. All of theses resources should stay on the shelves regaurdless of their material.",0
"What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell CAPS5 a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall CAPS1 guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""CAPS2 me"" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first NUM1 minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied ""CAPS3"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled ""CAPS4 CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""CAPS5 two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to CAPS6. PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot DATE1 day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were CAPS6, my friend CAPS8 who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. ORGANIZATION1'montae was CAPS9 CAPS10 as was CAPS8. ORGANIZATION1'montae was taller than me by about NUM3 inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. CAPS8 was a quiet, CAPS4 it alone type of person. She was about NUM4 inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as CAPS5 can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when CAPS5 barely know someone CAPS5 can quickly find out that laughing leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment. Laughter is a good way to become close to the people around CAPS5. The next time your with your friends or grouped with strangers tell them a joke. Priceless!",0
"A library is a public place for all ages. They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons. For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it. For adults they have coffe tables, sofa seats, and many different things while they read their books. never should a library have to disclousre certain materials because of the ages that come in and out.              Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive. I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for, they should also be monitored while in the library. Most kids woldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it any way. The library is a public place and is made for all ages, even though there are book stores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't throw them out of a library. There should be equal rights all over, yes even in libraries.     The world is full of offensive things period. Now while a child a is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library. The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything. I think that if the parents teach thier children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines. If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain exstint in my selction of books. I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in thier but at the same I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing. This subject really doesn't bother me, so no I don't think they should remover certain books just because children are in the library.",0

"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigibles load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" is understood in paragraph nine. This was the biggest obstacle the builders had to face. The builders developed a plan of ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. Although the mast was finished due to CAPS1 Nature a new law no dirigibles has ever docked at the Empire State Building.",0
"It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire state Building. The first reason's that, the law against flying airships to low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so. Next is that the thoughtes in being unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is flammable A big reason is when the german dirigible got destryed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much more worse the accident could have been if it had happened on such a densely populated area suched as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State building; but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residentscitizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers and the aviation pioners.",0
"Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends even became friends? Maybe not, but maybe you have and couldn't remember. Well this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend PERSON3 and I became friends. I'm also going to tell you how we have stayed friends for as long as we have and all the little things that have kept us friends. Admittedly we did not start off as friends who laughed all the time, instead we started off as a crier and a helper.  PERSON3 and I first met in the eighth grade. I had just gotten called out of my first period class and greeted by my math teacher PERSON1. PERSON1 told me that we had just gotten a new student that moved here from LOCATION1 and wasn't exactly happy about it. She also asked me if I wouldn't mind showing her around the school with another classmate, PERSON4, I agreed and walked into the room PERSON3 was in. When I saw her the first thing I noticed was her eyes, as the tears went down her face. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who, like PERSON1 said wasn't happy. I will admit i was a little scared to try and show her around seeing as she wasn't happy at all to be here. But once we got started she had calmed down immensely, but she still wouldn't even crack a smile at our feeble tempts to make jokes. I still felt like she should be happy and broke out the big guns. So I walked differently and talked in a funny voice, I even started saying random funny things in long pauses. Eventually she smiled, so I kept going. Toward the end I got her and PERSON4 to laugh so hard we all almost wet ourselves. But as funny as it was for us, it definitely wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know the type of funny things that happen and no matter what, you always remember it when you see that person it happened with, right? Well to say the least PERSON3 and I have a lot of those moments. Granted a lot of them happen with other people, but that's what makes it fun. Like this one time in our drawing and painting class we, PERSON3, LOCATION2, and CAPS1 and I, were all in PERSON2's little office getting a picture to draw. I had been hyper pretty much all day and so had CAPS3 else. I randomly look around the room and see a really cute looking poster I hadn't noticed ever before and without realizing it I had said aloud, ""CAPS2, that's really cute."" CAPS3 started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground. I still hadn't realized I said it aloud and was really confused but still laughing because watching them laugh was really entertaining. They finally calmed down long enough to say what I'd just said and I blushed but started laughing along. Now every time they see me and remember that moment they crack up laughing and they point to something and say it the way I said it. That's why I think that having the big memories of the really funny thing has kept us together. It helps us remember the fun times during the bad times. It also helps to keep our link strong throughout the group of our friends.  But the little things matter too. Every little thing we do together as friends helps us later. If we didn't do all the little funny things and only did either big funny things, or boring things, I don't think our friendship would last long. Like when we're talking and we accidentally burp or we fart while we walk. Or maybe when I laugh and I hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle. Possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us together it's how we are and who we become with that other person, I feel like I become a better person and I believe I help her become one too. Besides the little things are just as funny as the big things we do.  So as I've stated before laughter is a big part of a friendship. PERSON3 and my friendship hadn't started in of laughter, it started in tears and grew to be laughter. Laughter had brought us together in an act of weirdness and it has stayed very strong ever since, not only because we had a lot in common, to be frank we don't really even have that much in common, it is because of the big hilarious moments we've shared not only together, but with other people and the little things we do on a daily basis that we find really funny. I do have to say laughter is probably the best thing to keep any relationship good and healthy.",0

"I believe that computers have a positieve effect on people. They do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficent and easy to use i will further explain my reasons. First of all, computers allow you to talk to others online. Talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. I always talk to my friends online. We talk to each other using webcams, instany messaging, or talking on a social site like facebook. Computers and webcams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives. Next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. Studies shown that PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an enclyepdia or other book. Computers are much more efficent and easier to use than books. It can agree that computers are much more efficent and that i like to use them. If you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it. Finally, computers are more efficent and easy to use. If you give a person to coose from a computer or a set of encyelpedias, most people would choose the computer. Computers are so much easier to use than books. On the comuter you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. Now, if you use a book or enclyelpedia it could take several minutes to find what you are looking for, and then they only give very little information, unlike a computer that can give you millions of results for one topic. This proves that computer are more efficent than books. In conclusion, i believe that computer have a posieve effect on people. I do because you can talk to people online, it allows you to get research done quicker, and computers are more efficent and easy to use. I hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers.",0
"The mood created by the author of the excurpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of our Lives in the memoir was love, happiness, and old memories of home.

"The night was a cool, DATE1 night, not too cold but definetly not the muggy temperatures DATE2 brought you. This was the type of NUM1 degree weather that would allow you to wear jeans and a t-shirt and still be comfortable. The air hugged my skin as I walked up the path that led to my friends front door. Overhead I knew the stars hung in the sky but they were paid no attention by me. Inside the house I knew both of my bestfriends were awaiting my arrival. I also knew that there was a potential of them being angry with me. For what, I did not know. I did know that when I left school that day there was a feeling in my gut that told me something wasn't right. Walking home, as I increased the distance between them and me, there was a churning in my stomach that prodded me to look back. When I did, they were both staring at me with looks I couldn't (or didn't want to) place on their faces.  All of that made my heart give occasional, hard, thumps on my chest from the nervousness. Yet, I pretended that everything was okay. ""For all I know"", I told myself, ""it might as well be, and I'm overreacting."" I knocked on the white-painted wooden door and stared at the maroon side-paneling, waiting for an answer. My friend LOCATION1 answered the door. From somewhere inside I could hear my other friend PERSON1 laughing. I knew that I had missed out on something, the laughter explained that to me as I stepped inside. There was a hollow feeling in my chest. I wanted to know what I had missed out on. I hated not knowing. A mix of emotions jumped around inside my body, causing my head to be a jumbled mess that I couldn't make sense of.  I gently pushed open LOCATION1's bedroom door with my fingertips. Like always, the turquoise walls and the sound of radio station music jumped out to greet me. PERSON1 was laughing and dancing to the music, but when she saw me, she stopped and stared. The moment seemed to stretch and expand in time. I felt my guard go up. If she was mad, fine. I didn't do anything wrong and I would maintain my innocence. The moment was stretching and stretching to the point I thought it might break, then CAPS1 hugged me, completely catching me off gaurd, but filling me with a sense of right, because I'd known I hadn't done anything wrong. Everything seemed normal for what felt like a second and then PERSON1 explained the gut feeling I had when I was walking home from school that day. I was being accused of not putting in any work into a reading project. The accusation appalled me and deflated my pride. Instead, a mild anger boiled up and I simply walked out the door and into the cool night. I heard my friends calling my name and following me down the street but I kept walking. I told myself this was out of anger, but DATE3 I know it was for the sake of making a scene.  The footsteps I listened for behind me suddenly came at a faster pace. I glanced over my shoulder and saw PERSON1 running at me. Against my will, I let out a high-pitched scream and started running, digging my feet into the concrete sidewalk. I felt determination flow through my veins. I would walk all the way home in the dark to make my point. PERSON1 caught up to me and tried to pull me back to the house but I resisted with all my might. I knew I couldn't get out of her grip, out of sheer stubborness, I planted my butt on the curb and refused to budge. I realized I had only passed two houses. My friends exchanged glances and picked me up by my arms and legs and started carrying me towards the direction of the house. I grasped for the anger that was slipping from my hands. I wanted to stay mad but I couldn't. I started laughing and any tension I still felt swarming around me lifted up and flew away. A grin decorated my face from one ear to the other and my good sense came back to me gracefully. They set me down in the middle of the road. I looked up and admired the stars, that I had missed before, winking at me from above. The last ribbons of laughter still danced around in the air and whispered to me that everything was going to be okay.",0
"CAPS2 are not bad for society. They actually can be quite good for people. Computers allow us to talk with people online. They can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life. People think they are bad, but all you have to do is look a little deeper and you will find the good in CAPS7. CAPS5 people use a CAPS2, <PERCENT2NUM1> of the time CAPS7 is to talk with people on the CAPS3, whether CAPS7 is using video chat or e-mail. People who don't like to use CAPS2 and e-mail CAPS10 ""CAPS4 not use a phone or even talk to them in person."" With e-mail, you can send a message to some one miles away. If you are sending someone a list, a recipe for example. you don't want to CAPS10 to them over the phone. CAPS7 would be easier to type CAPS7 out and then send CAPS7 to them over the e-mail. ""CAPS5 my son said. he was going to tech me how to use e-mail, I thought CAPS7 was going to be a waste of time,"" CAPS6 PERSON1, senior citizen. ""CAPS7 tursns out, CAPS7 wasn't. Now i use e-mail e-mail every day. Many people think email is a waste of time, but CAPS7 can help you in your everyday life. The CAPS3 can helps in MONTH1 ways also. CAPS7 can help us get information about various topics. If you are trying to cook a stir fry but you don't know what to put in CAPS7. You try to call you mother but she isn't there. Your next choise is to look look CAPS7 up on the CAPS2. CAPS7 turns out theres a website that gives a recipe for a stir fry and you follow a do make the best one even. I know for an experience that you can find maps to places on line, since i have to go some is here almost everyweek. Google map is the most used place on the CAPS3, besides e-mail. Some newspaper have websites CAPS11 you can read the paper without actually paying for the paper This saves you money and CAPS7 was less paper CAPS11 we can save trees. The huge world of the CAPS3 can change our lives. PERCENT1 of people that use the CAPS2 almost everyday are students. Students use the CAPS2 for many reasons. The biggest one is typing. Students use typing to type reports and e-mail. ""I have messy handwriting"", CAPS10 student, PERSON2. ""CAPS11 if if weren't for the CAPS2, no one would be able to read my homework and reports. Not even me"" PERSON2 is the one of many people who are lucking that they harmy typing on the CAPS2. Another reason students use CAPS2 is to look up information for reports. If a student puts a bibliography in his report, you will see that heshe used the CAPS3 PERCENT2 of the time. There MONTH1 not be a book in a local library for a student to use, but the CAPS3 will have many website and blogs for himher to use. The third reason is for help. There are many website that can help a student to use for help in any subject. The CAPS3 can help a student pass school. A CAPS2 can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science. That is how computers are good.",0

"What's a CAPS1 CAPS2 Laughter?  Would me and PERSON1 be best friends CAPS2 ever laughing? That would be a negative. I honestly think laughter is the biggest part of CAPS1. What kind of CAPS1 is two friends who never laugh? If there are any people in the world that don't laugh, I bet they don't have any friends, well at least true friends. I feel sorry for these people. I can't even imagine life CAPS2 laughter. All of my friends and I laugh all the time. Especially with me and PERSON1. When PERSON1 and I are around each other, CAPS5's usually non stop laughter. PERSON1 and I laugh about almost everything. We have so many inside jokes its not even funny (well to me and her CAPS5 is), such as ""an upstairs CAPS3 CAPS4!"" or ""john, john, john, john"". See there things people wouldn't think where funny, but whenever one of us blurts one of our stupid inside jokes out, we start laughing until we ball our eyes out. If I imagine me and PERSON1 never laughing, then that would be the worst CAPS1. I hate to even think about us never laughing. CAPS5 sounds horrible. If me and PERSON1 never laughed, then we most likely would not be friends. I'm so glad I have so much laughter in my life. I don't know what I would do CAPS2 CAPS5.",0
"Do you believe that certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no i do not. it is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completley remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it.     I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. some times storys cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Wether those words be good or bad i feel like with out them the book that is being read is not all of what it could of been. in my oppionion censorship takes away from certain values or qualitys the book could of had with the original context still in it. and to me that is not fair. its not fair to the author. and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book.     I know from my personal expierences with reading books that 'yes' i have read books that have had bad language in them. but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completley taken off the shelf. For example the book 'CAPS1' CAPS2: PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being scensored or taken off the shelf for that matter.     All i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. because that is getting away from what the over all message is about. Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No i do not. Neither should you",0
"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of admiration. I think it was a mood of admiration because Narciso admires the fact that his mother and father both left their ""families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" CAPS1 mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends. I think the memoir sets the mood family and friend because it talks alot about the meaning of family for example in paragraph NUM1 the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" That means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were. CAPS1 thing the memoir said was ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means that his parents turned a small house into a welcoming. loving place that holds so many memories.",0
"During the CAPS1 break my family went to LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were head to LOCATION1, LOCATION4. The ride there was long but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents house there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later while I was outside I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for CAPS1 break. They still had to got to school. I told them that if they're lucky then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. DATE3 they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off, now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night my grandma made us some barbeque chiken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmas cooking and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns. It would me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air soft gun, my friend PERSON6 told me that I was shooting it wrong. ""CAPS3 am I shooting it wrong?"" I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of the time. But he was one of my good friends so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, PERSON6 asked my to hold onto his air soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on one of my fingers and somehow I shot him in the back. He freaked out a little bit and asked why I shot him.  ""I didn't mean too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! Pluse you said that the safety was on!"" PERSON6 forgave me and told me that it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends NUM1, PERSON3, LOCATION3, PERSON1 were laughing and so was my cousin PERSON4. CAPS4 confesed that he was the one that shot PERSON6 in the back. So PERSON6 decide that he was going to shoot CAPS4 back. Then somehow it beacame an all out shooting between all of us. I had lots of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still in LOCATION4, my CAPS5 DATE4 asked if I can babysit for her. So the next day after lunch I let my little cousin PERSON2 play in the backyard after he was done eating. My baby cousin PERSON5 was taking a nap so I told PERSON2 that we can't be to loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done we decided to go back into the house. We got locked out. Then I remembered that TIME1 when my CAPS5 was still home, PERSON2 was messing with the lock. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was locked too. PERSON2 told me that the garage door can open, but he didn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a couple minutes more we went over to one of their neighbors house so that I can call my CAPS5 because I didn't have her cell phone number. But the neighbor only had their house number. Then I called my dad so that I can get her number. I told him what happend and he started to laugh. PERSON5 was still taking her nap so things were still kind of ok. I called my CAPS5 and we waited until she got home. She told me that it was ok and it happend to her twice while PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that PERSON2 and I had fun outside.  I had such a great time while I was in LOCATION4. Just being in LOCATION4 is one of my favorite places to be. Espicially when I'm with my friends and family.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major obstacle to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. To allow dirigibles to anchor at empire state building for several hours a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire buildings flat roof, so rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside.

"Censorship in libraries has gotten to strict making the next generation miss key lessons learned about life. How would you feel if you went to the library and as an adult would only be able to check out childrens books, magazines, and music? Now i know thats a little extreme but in all seriousness what are we without knowledge? Where would we be if there was no books, magazines, or music left? No libraries means no knowledge, no books, no life lessons, no imagination, and above all no excitement. we would de-evolve back into our animal-like state, because in all actuality we humans have only one thing that has given us the power to become so advanced and smart, our brains. There was once a quote by which i live my life by, it went like this 'if knowledge is power then books must be the means of getting that power'. From my own knowledge and views of the world i will give you my argument on censorships and how they effect libraries.     Censorship, what do we all think of when we as americans say censorship? I think of  bad thing like cuss words,nudity, and battle scenes. The thing about these is they are displayed in different ways such as music. an example of music not being censored would be rap. go ahead get the explicit version of that rap song or sometimes it might already be bad enough. I personnely don't like rap so this opinion is biased, I more like a rock and metal music. people like music and it takes away from our freedom, if you don't like what they are saying just don't listen to it.          Another subject of intrest when we talk about censorship issues is magazines. We all at some point have seen or learned of naughty magazines like playboy. Now im all for making sure those type of magazines stay out of school libraries, but public libraries should have their own adult sections were we might not put playboys but stuff like hunting magazines,or hot rod magazines line the adult sections shelves.      The last thing that is subjected to rather extreme censorship is books. Lets be honest we all had a favorite book when we were little or as we grew up. One such book that is an absolute classic is 'The CAPS1 of ORGANIZATION1' its currently being removed because it has like one or two cuss words in it. I mean really people its a great book but at the first sign of a cuss word everbody starts shouting burn it. Now many of the following generations will never get to read that classic because people took it out of libraries. i feel that people should learn to relax andnot fret over one or two cuss words because that is apparenly all it takes to ruin a great book.     So whats my final conclusion? when does our first amendment right to free speech with censorship and too much censorship meet? Apparently in libraries where one can't read ORGANIZATION1, wood craftmanship, or listen to music that involves cuss words. In my personnel opinion i think that adults should have their own section uncensored, teens should have only censorship on things like nudity, and children well they are just right on this subject no more censorship is needed. So i ask you, the one who grades my essay to just stop and think with an open mind how long do you hide your children or your grandchildren form the real world. In the real world these things are deamed acceptable if they weren't exceptable they wouldn't be out there to begin with. Truly if you decide to take out classics like PERSON1 we lose not only knowledge and the story we lose our freedom",0
"CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people are using computers for excessive amounts of time a recent study confirmed this reporting that ""PERCENT1 of LOCATION2's population uses a computer for more than NUM1 hours a day"". That means people have less time to exercise, enjoy nature and socialize. I consider that the benefits of computers are greatly outwayed by the problems that arise from them to up, computers limit a person's health-both physical and social - and do more harm than good to siciety. Spending too much time on computers can deteriavate a person's health by preventing them from spending that time exercising take for example LOCATION3, who goes on computer at least five times a week, for about four hours. LOCATION3 has stopped playing soccer and because she prefers to spend time on facebook. Instead of recieving six hours of exercise a week. she now recieves an hour this has to LOCATION3 gaining weight and losing health. The problem is there are millions of children like LOCATION3 who are not getting enough exercise instead opting. to spend too much time on their computers. Another problem is that people spend less time enjoying nature. Now, they choose to surf the web instead. This nads to people caring less about our planet and animals. Nature is very important and can be extremely fun, so this is a shame. Furthermore, those who choose to spend overwhelming amounts of time on computers tend to interact less with family members. No longer do most children help cook, clean, do chones, or spend time with siblings. One mother says ""ever since my daughter got her new laptop, she hasn't gone once to play with her baby brother or friends"" unfortunatly the same is true for most teens today computers have limited nou, much time families spend together. In conclusion, computers do harm to society they keep people cooped up in their rooms, istead of exercising, enjoying nature, or having fun with their families and friends. In doing so, computers have become a mause to society. Therefore, CAPS1 is crucial that people who spend more than an hour a day on computers use that time to exercise or socialize, even to do nothing at all would be better overall, computers are no longer beneficiery to society.",0
"Book CAPS1     CAPS2 I think about removing certain materials such as books, music, movies, and-or magazines is that it should be your choice. I always thought that was part of our constitutional right.     I read alot of urban books because that's CAPS2 I enjoy. They realae towhere I have been, or where I MONTH1 be going in my life. No they are not the kinds of books I would read to my grand childern, but they MONTH1 choose later in life that they also enjoy urban books and movies.      You MONTH1 not enjoy reading the materials that I enjoy either but that doesn't mean you should banned them. There are alot of books, and movies that I don't care for but I wouldn't ask for them to be banned. If everyone started CAPS1 CAPS2 they don't like, there wouldn't be any need for movies,  libraries, or book stores. Kids wouldn't have a future because they wouldn't know where they came from. CAPS2's bad to you MONTH1 not be bad to me, or the next person.     When you go into a library, or book store, you already have and idea of CAPS2 you are looking for. If there are books that are not appropreiate for kids, they should have their own section that reads, 'For CAPS3 CAPS4'. We are the CAPS3 and parents. We should be the one's in control of our kids and CAPS2 they read and watch. I don't think CAPS1 the materials would make the problem go away because kids these days, if they want them bad enough, will figure out away to read or watch them anyway.

It said ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way.",0
The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was safety because outside the U.S dirigibles were using hydrogen instead of helium which is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law said it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building.,0

"I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature. She is saying that she was not ready for all the challenges she was going to face, For example she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it she just said I will take it again next year. In the story she also longed for her homeland, which she truley missed. She coped with this by buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother overall the main character showed depth and maturity throughout the piece.",0

"The content of a library should be full of various material even if one MONTH1 find certain materials offensive.  Just because someone MONTH1 think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether?  Some subjects MONTH1 be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them.     One subject that MONTH1 be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases.  You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area.  It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.     Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history.  Some history MONTH1 be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them.  The CAPS1 for example.  That was a very dark period in history.  Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in.  It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is.  We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.     People's likes in music vary.  There are so many different types and styles of music.  Some music MONTH1 be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library?  The library should always have a large variety of different music.  Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.      Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing.  Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information.  If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information.  Having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject.",0

"The obsticles the builders of the ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where the weather, and the Building Frame. The CAPS1 obsticle was the wind because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violant air currents. The wind was an obsticle because of a big gust of wind came it could not building materials or even workers off the building. A second obsticle was the building Frame because the dirigible was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady.

"Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches them hand-eye coordination, the ability to learn about people and places and allows for people to entertain themselves. As I said before computers are very useful for the advances of hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is very important in our current world because in order to play sports and type effectively you must have hand-eye coordination. When I was a boy of NUM1 years I had survey low hand-eye coordination skills and my playing suffered because of it. Now after a couple yours of playing online my baseball, lacrosse and basketball skills have improved from playing online and practicing. Also my typing has gone up from NUM2 words-per-minute. In NUM3 words-per-minute. Allowing me to write reports faste and allow more time for revision. But the internet also allow me to search the web to make the aspect of my report go much faster... Though out people needed to suport their opinions and. Now the internet for a person to such to find facts relating to their topic. This bad of help can male school projects easier, make students be even smaller and give opportunity to help in need. As I got ready NUM4 while my position paper this year. I realized I needed NUM1 usually this would be difficult but with the help of computers, research can be made a whats let easier. Secondly, I learned so much while my CAPS1 CAPS2, like for example don't really pick the president. The votes they gave actually elect a spesculative to go to the CAPS2 to. Finally, as the earthquake in LOCATION1 I was able to donate through the CAPS3 CAPS4 website. These examples show how important the internal to learn about people and places, maybe give a helping hand. Finally, the last great thing about the internet and computers is that you can entertain yourself through online games and movies. My mom is always telling me I should ways to myself without dragging her into playing catch with me the internet and computers allow me to play online gones by myself. Secondly, movies on computers can be a real time if you want to around. These are the reasons why I believe computers are important for improving eye-hand coordination, learning about different people and places, and the ability entertain you self. Though my opinion will only count to myself I hope you will to stress the importance of computers in your future articles.",0
"When I was in third grade my parents decided that we should move to where my CAPS1 was born and raised and where my CAPS2 lived. I, being a determined third grader, was angry and told them that I would not move and even sat on the floor and told them that I was not going. Needless to say I did not get very far, but I was still not happy about being moved from my friends and my CAPS3's side of the family that I had been around since I was little. My friends were all I had known through my years in elementary school and I was no where near ready to say goodbye to them. It was very hard saying goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later on. We moved three hours away from my hometown. It was a pretty big move, especially for a ten year old who had never really been anywhere else.  Being a new student is never easy. Especially with a shy, quiet personality like mine is and the first day was a scary one. I remember it very vividly. I walked in with my CAPS4 and my new teacher happened to be in the office at the time, so she took me down to the class and showed me around the school. I was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change. When class started the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and tell them about myself. I have never been much of a public speaker and it is hard for me to believe that I actually did stand there and talk about myself. I can not even do that very well today, and I am way less shy then I was back then. It was very terrifying to say the least even more so when I was done speaking and the class sat in dead silence. Then I slowly walked to my seat and being the shy person I am, did not talk for the rest of the time until lunch.  At lunch a little girl with freckles and glasses, like myself, came and sat with me. Once she broke down my shy exterior we were laughing, playing and having a real good time. And for the first time that day I thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay. Me and her became really good friends along with the other girls she hung out with. We sat next to each other in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers and spent recess together everyday. She was the first best friend I had made when I moved and I was glad it was her and not someone else. Today I am very thankful to her for taking the time to get to know me when I at first was shy and not saying much, because I know how it feels to approach someone you do not know.  The laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together. Without her that first day I am unsure how the rest of that day or week would have gone. Without people like her who are willing to make a new friend it would have been a lonely first couple of days for me. Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you do not know someone very well you still can have a good time. The rest of that day is a better memory because we shared laughter and became friends. It made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in.",0
"Computers and modern technology are advancing quickly, and more and more people are beginning to use them. Some people say that computers are a bad influence on LOCATION1. I think other wise. I think computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science. I believe computers are ideal for school work and comunicating with others, as long as they are used in moderation. Computers make school projects so simple I don't know if we could do without. Our social studies teacher PERSON1 says that PERCENT1 of his projects involve something on the computer. The internet is a great place to research for big papers and projects. With over thirty-million educational and informational websites, its easy to locate what you need quickly and easily. Once you have finished researching it is easy to type your report. If it isn't a written report, then there are many other programs for fancy presentations. Take microsoft CAPS1 for example: you can make exotic background and texts, as well as unique animations to emphasize or to make it pop right off the page. Computers are also an ideal way to communicate with friends and family. Emailing is quick and easy to tell others what you want to say. If you want to chat, then you can use CAPS2 or instant messaging. This allows you to type and sent emails faster. Both of these programs are an inivative way to talk with a family member that isn't home. Like lets say my dad goes on business to LOCATION2. We can email back and forth every day. And now with ORGANIZATION1 (a video chat) you can see the person and actually talk to them like they're back at home. Computers have their advantages but they also have disadvantages. Computers are great for communicating and school work, but when used in excess can be unhealthy. Here is one example: my older brother PERSON2 is a senior in high school. He is in school from NUM1 to NUM2:pm and as he gets home he heads straight for his computer. He is on there for at least five hours a night and that leaves time for dinner and not much of anything else including sleep. I think that computers are a great invation in modern technology as long as people limit themselves. Computers are coming out with new features everyday and who know theyll be like...",0

"It was a regular day in LOCATION2, LOCATION1. That special day we were supposed to start our state writing tests. I wasn't necessarily worried about it due to the fact that I have always done good on state testing, and never failed at test for state testing. CAPS22 it was pretty much a regular day for PERSON1. But I didn't know CAPS18 awaited me in the computer lab..... Thanks to new ORGANIZATION1 state testing laws, we have to take the writing test on the computer. The only place in the school that has enough computers for the whole class to take was the either the ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, or the old computer lab (I don't know why we used the ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, but we did). CAPS22, I was already in a hyper mood because CAPS1's sense of humor normally cheers me up and puts me in a hyper mood. CAPS22, as we were walking to the computer lab, me and CAPS1 started cracking jokes about PERSON3 mainly because everyone else does, CAPS22 we just add to the effect. CAPS19 we reached the computer lab, but the door was locked. CAPS22 while we waited for PERSON2 to lock her door and come down to the computer lab, me and CAPS1 made a few more jokes about PERSON3, but little did I know the real humor was awaiting for me in the computer lab. When PERSON2 got to the door and unlocked it, I was the ORGANIZATION1 to come in and sit down in the seat I desired. PERSON4 followed next to me, and CAPS4 next to him. I remember a trick with the computer when you push CAPS5 CAPS19 CAPS6 CAPS19 CAPS7 and when it goes to a different screen, you push CAPS8 and it will put the computer to sleep. I tried it a couple times while he was looking and he would always swat my hand away. After a while, I decided the best way to pull this trick was to make him forget about it, CAPS19 do it when he was least expecting it. CAPS22 about NUM1 minutes later after I planned my trick, I tried it again. I caught him looking away at CAPS4. CAPS22 I pushed CAPS5 CAPS19 CAPS6 CAPS19 CAPS7. CAPS19 it went to a different screen and I pushed CAPS8. My plan had worked. CAPS19 PERSON4 turned around right as soon as the computer was going to sleep and freaked out. He started cussing and hitting me. I thought this was mildly funny CAPS22 I got a couple laughs out of it, but nothing could have prepared me for CAPS18 was about to happen. After PERSON4 woke his computer up and got started with his test, CAPS4 asked CAPS18 I was laughing about. I told him, ""CAPS15, you should have seen it. I put PERSON4's computer to sleep and he flipped out on me."" CAPS4 laughed and went back to his test. Two minutes went by and CAPS4 tapped on my shoulder. I looked at him and asked, ""CAPS18 up kid?"" CAPS19 CAPS4 said, ""CAPS21 this."" CAPS22 I sat up straight and looked at him. CAPS19 he asked PERSON4, ""CAPS18 did PERSON1 do to your computer? This?"" and he held the power button down and shut the computer off right in the middle of PERSON4's test. I thought I was going to cry. It was CAPS22 funny me and CAPS4 started laughing as loud as possible. PERSON2, of course, wasn't happy about it. CAPS22 she told me and CAPS4 to quiet down. But it didn't matter.

"Personally I believe that items that are found offensive should be left on the book shelves. People that find them offensive don't have to read them they can just ignore them and move on with their life.     Students MONTH1 need to use that certain information in a classroom. If libraries take the information out of the library the students will not be able to find the info needed for their project or paper. Students will eventually learn all about these offensive magazines, movies, music, and books someday in their lifetime. If offensive books are taken down where else will they go, they are still going to be offensive somewhere else.     Libraries who have offensive books are not trying to offend anyone in anyway, they are on the shelves for the education of the reader or viewer. If movies are that offensive, don't rent them and save yourself and the libraries time. People get offended by all of these readings from a certain library, if the library chooses not to take the books off the shelves then go to a different library. Also the internet will more than likely have all of the information that is just as offensive.     Internet is a virtual library, you can search videos, books, magazines, and music. If people think they are getting rid of the offensive books, magazines, etc. They are wrong because the internet will hold that information for as long as it needs to. Library censorship is a pointless act due to the information provided on the internet. Libraries should be able to choose the books and information that they have in their building. As long as those books, music, magazines, movies, etc, are put in the right section.     The movies that parents don't want their children to see MONTH1 be placed in the wrong section of the library. In that point of view you could see why parents are getting upset about inappropriate items on the shelves. The books should be divided so that children have their own section of the library and adults have their own section as well.     Most of these offensive items are not placed in libraries because of this problem with people being offended. Movies that are that offensive should probably be in a movie store that states that the movies are offensive and could be inappropriate. Maybe people over react to the situation and don't realize that the movie, book, etc, are not offensive enough to make an argument over it. I personally have never been to a library and saw a book, magazine, movie, song that was offensive to me or my family.     What does an offensive book look like? More than likely it has something to do with someone's religion, ethnicity, etc. Items are only offensive to certain people. If you or someone you know that is offended greatly by a book, song, magazine, or movie in a specific library don't go back or tell the person you know as well.     In conclusion if a book, movie, etc, is that offensive in a library near by, avoid that library and don't worry about going back. Offensive material could also be learning material",0
"My opinion on this would be that , they are going to learn about CAPS3 anyways so why take CAPS3 off the shelfs ? No I don't think any adult material should be cencered . You know when your little girl or boy as about what they have in there hand , simple just take CAPS3 from them and say 'CAPS1 your eyes can't handle .' CAPS2 , they are going to ask questions and CAPS2 , they will start to wonder , but they learn that stuff in school anyways so what's the big deal ?      If I had a child , who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions , I would simply tell them 'CAPS3's a mommy and daddy thing ' , and then hide CAPS3 in a diffrent place to where I know they can't find CAPS3 . I mean , when you was a child , of course your parents would have yelled at you for going into there room and looking threw there stuff , but then again , you would yell at them for having CAPS3 when they got older . So don't disaplin your children for CAPS1 they 'stummbled' on to , you should learn how to hide your stuff better . I'm not saying I would have any of that stuff (why would I need CAPS3 ?) but , as a student looking into the future , I have a opinion .     Now lets say that you have a couple of maginzines under your bed and your child happens to see them . CAPS2 they will start looking at them , and some words might come out , but that does not mean they did CAPS1 wrong , CAPS3's the parents fault . Like I said before I would hide my stuff better but , then again , I don't need that kind of stuff to live a happy life , I have my children and my husband and that is all I'll ever need .     So before you parents decide to protest about the library having stuff that children are not suppose to see , check your room , hide your stuff so you wont be the embarassed one . No , a library can have whatever they want , CAPS3's not your place to say what they should get ride of and what should stay.As a student , I stand up and say , No , adult material should not be banned from library's , then you would here the adults complaining and that is CAPS1 we don't need .",0
"Have you ever had someone move away and you wanted to keep in touch? Well having a computer allows this to happen. CAPS4, it gives students the to learn different places. People and much more. But why do some people not hire them? First computers allow you to talk online with friends and family. For example using email, CAPS1 and video chat for example I have a friend who moved away and now we email back and forth to keep in touch. CAPS1 allows people to chat instintly and upload pictures and videos. For examples my CAPS2 CAPS3 pictures of my baby cousins so people can see how their growing up. Lastly, some buessnesses use a webcam to talk to other people. Say the boss on a the but to see how he employees were doing withness him he could hook up a web cam and have a conversation with them. That is how computers allow people to the CAPS4, computers CAPS4 people to learn about things, for example if a student rod to make a topic they could type the topic a website like bring or google and they could find all the answers they needed to help them with their project. CAPS4 if a family wanted to go on to see they could search for it and find a hotell and sites they might want to see that is how computer allows people so that the reader can read their hand writing. CAPS4 they help pay taxes. For example, turbo tax is an online program that allows people to pay taxes online and it remembers every tax you have paid. So if some company sends you a notice saying you havent payed a bill you can go on turbo tax and check. So reader these are some ways why people should enjoy computers. They allow people to talk to friends and family by email, CAPS1, and CAPS4 by webcam. They CAPS4 give people the ability to learn information faraway places and people. Lastly what is so bad about having a computer? They allow people to pay taxes online and CAPS4 type papers. Computers are needed in this day and age or else some people would not be able to survive without them. So reader these are some reasons why people should easily computers.",0
"In the essay intitled Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit the setting changes as so does the mood of NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening. This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of old-timers. From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first town, a ghost town, The sun was beginning to heat down, This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another NUM3 miles to go. NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a A Rough Road Ahead sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock dirigibles there. One of the obstacles they faced was safety, because the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¶ NUM1). If the dirigible burst into flames in New York, a lot of people would die. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds were violent on top of the building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (¶ NUM2). This would have been very dangerous. A third obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ NUM3). Although this was broken twice, it was still illegal to dock dirigibles at that low height. As a cause of all these obstacles, the idea to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was scrapped.",0
"The mood that the CAPS2 used in the memoir was joyful and motivating at times. The CAPS2 was able to paint a marviles painting of his parents, by using words such as brave, courageous, strength, perseverance, loving, carrieing, and gracious this shows the reader that the CAPS2 wants to paint a serious mood. Also when the CAPS2 went on to describe his home it gave a sence of loving and joyful enviroment or mood. For example the CAPS2 was able to experince real friendship, and endless celebrations, love and the strength of helping others, CAPS1 his childhood. The CAPS2 used a powerful since of mood to show his pashen for his parents and his home.",0
"Libraries should not remove a book from the shelves just because someone didn't like it or finds it offensive. If there is a group of people that are interested in a book and want to read it more then once they will like telling a new person about it. Then if another student has decided they don't like the book and they don't want anyone else reading it becuase they find it offensive then I honestly believe it shouldn't be taking off the shelves.      I think it would be different if everyone found the book offensive, but if it's just one or two people complaining then I don't think they should take it down and ruin it for everybody else. It's just a book and students should know just because it's there doesn't mean its directed towards them. I think they should overlook it.     If your playing some music, dacing around, and just having fun with it then thats good. Now, if there is cussing and talking about drugs and those sort of things in a song then don't play it in a school system or around someone that MONTH1 be religious or against that kind of thing because they MONTH1 not like it and think that your into that sort of things. They might not want to be around you as much. Show them respect and play something everyone can have fun with. So if the libary has this type of music it should be monitored as to who checks it out.     Movies are something you have to look out for too. Movies already have ratings so this kind of helps for people to check them out and make sure the movie would be safe to watch. If your getting movies from the libary then I would think it would already been watched by an adult there to make sure it can be watched by a student or a child. I wouldnt want my little sibblings watching something that they didn't need to see or hear.     You have to watch out for magazines too. You want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean. Kids MONTH1 not know what is bad from good, but you still have teenagers. You don't want kids seeing nudity, cussing, or drugs in any magazine. If I were to walk in a library and see those kind of things in a magazine I would suggest you to take it off the shelves. I would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things. I wouldn't want them thinking about doing anything bad like they saw in the magazine. I'm just looking out for their safety.     Libraries MONTH1 always need advice. They need to always have an eye out for things and make sure everything is clean and so that everyone can look at it, read it, or watch it. I'm glad we have these safety ideas for kids. I hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things. I know I if I were to ever have children I would want them around something they understand and know, nothing bad and harmful. So thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this",0

Earlier in the story, it explains how the winter hibiscus does not die.

"The setting explains an early summer evening with some eccentric men. The mood that he would be in would probably be lively. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice (Kurmaskie) says that if you were very lively, I would take that as a way of being drunk without being drunk, and doing whatever someone thinks you should do without knowing you are being persuaded to do it.",0
"People are spending to much time on their computers. They are on the computers when they should be exercising. People need to enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends. Let me explain more. Firstly, the people who are consently CAPS1 people, facebooking people, or on myspace aren't getting exercise. Now, more than ever people are becoming very obese. It is very unhealthy. People in my family that are always on facebook are not getting exercise, and becoming overweight. Eight out of ten CAPS2 aren't getting enough exercise. We need to get people moving and exercising. Secondly, People need to enjoy nature. Everyone is so caught up in their computers, they don't sit back, relay and take in nature. People don't get that the earth is polluted. Once animals are extinced they are not comming back. If they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone. Computers are the wall between inside and going outside in back at the world. Finaly, the computers are getting in the way of seeing family and friends. Everyone is so caught up in the newist computer they don't see their friends or family I know some people who when its time for dinner, they walk down to the kitchen. Get their food and bring if to their computer so they don't miss out on anthing family and friends are very important. PERCENT1 of CAPS2 onley see friends and family on holidays. Computers are getting in the way of everything! People arent getting the exercise they need. They aren't going outside to enjoy the nature and the arent seeing there friends and family. We need to get people off their butts and away from the computer. Why does everyone have to sit in front of the computer anyway?",0

Another thing is I am really nice to people I don't be mean to anyone, I listen to what they got to say. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn.

"In this memoir the author created a mood of what it was like in his childhood home. Based on pharagraph NUM1, cooking was a big part of the author's childhood life. The author describes a home filled with the smell of the kitchen and the ""passionate CAPS1 music."" CAPS2 a warm mood that makes you think of home, this pharagraph is the base of the authors childhood. The author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants that were friendly and always helped each other out. In pharagraph NUM2, the author describes a mood of family, friendship and acceptance. Even though the people of the neighborhood weren't all the same, they except one another as equals during a time of racism and segregation. Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremly difficult. It is hard to get good jobs when you just immigrated and maybe don't have a ton of money. It is also hard to get used to climate change, and learning another language. This creates a mood of hardship and rough times.

"When I go to a library I MONTH1 find some stuff that is offensive to me. But if somthing is offensive to me the person beside me MONTH1 not  think the same thing  is offensive to him or her. When people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not . There is a wide variety of people that all have diffrent opinions based on their history.      What I think is offensive MONTH1 be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed, published, or recorded and other people's eyes. The major problem is that offensive doesn't have a set definition. I don't think that you will ever find a definition that everyone can agree on. There needs to be a limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups. For example you would not want a kindergarder to be able to check out a CAPS1 movie.      Some censoring has to be done to protect people.But it all comes down to common sense. We won't ever all agree on what is offensive but if we use are common sense the problem MONTH1 be solved",0

"Are computers really as great as they seem? It seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are distractions that don't allow people to di ceratin things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. People's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your facebook, and looking at new videos on CAPS2.com. I know from experience facebook or myspace can be very addicting. I'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at NUM1 pm I've realized I haven't begun any of my loads of homework. This happens quite often, and I end up staying awake until around NUM2. The following moring I wake up at NUM3 am, exhausted. I am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because I am PERCENT1 sure they are on facebook or CAPS3 all night. This doesn't just happen with kids either, my mom just got a facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than I am. Sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. Kids start adding people as friends that they don't even know computers aren't just distractions, they are also very dangerous. At my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information, Even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. Just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be. As the local newspaper CAPS1, I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. Some people MONTH1 say ""that would never happen to me"" but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. A lot of times in families, instead of spending time together. syblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. One sybling MONTH1 need it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on CAPS3 and each believes they deserves the computer. Computers are starting to interest a lot with people's lives, in a negative way. Once again they are distracting, dangerous and hurt families. Computers hurt society more than it helps. And maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer.",0

"Dog CAPS1 Of DATE1  CAPS2 made me laugh every time I saw her droopy ears and pointy little nose. CAPS2 was my best friend, my dog. CAPS3 brought me happiness every moment I was with her.

Every DATE1 when we went camping with the PERSON1 family, we had to bring her with us. We had to bring her her own sleeping bag and camping chair to sit in. After a long day of swimming and walking around the lake,CAPS2 would hop up in her chair and go to sleep by the warm fire. When we walked with the other families dog PERSON2, CAPS3 would carry her own leash like in her mouth like I would've been holding it. Every little thing CAPS2 did differently than the average dog made us laugh. CAPS2 was ""CAPS4,"" as we called her. CAPS3 also loved to ""log."" CAPS2 pulled around giant logs or sticks in the water and chewed on them until there was nothing left but back. All of the grandparents loved her too. Grandpa had special cookies just for her because CAPS2 didn't like just any cookie. The time CAPS2 went over to his house on his birthday wearing her own party hat, jumping on his lap to give him a birthday kiss. He laughed so hard his eyes started to water. Every time we went somewhere the other grandma would beg to ""CAPS6-sit,"" CAPS3. Che loved her so much. When CAPS2 was there CAPS2 didn't get a kennel or a dog bed, CAPS2 got the couch. CAPS2 would take CAPS3 into town to buy her a cheeseburger and go to the park.  I taught her to do tricks like the LOCATION1 where CAPS2 bounced on her hind legs in circles, and I also taught her CAPS16 to speak. I would say ""CAPS9's on top a house?"" ""CAPS10. (CAPS11),"" ""who was the greatest CAPS12 player ever?"" ""CAPS10 (CAPS14 CAPS15),"" and ""CAPS16 does sandpaper feel?"" ""CAPS10."" That made everyone laugh. We would spend hours doing nothing but tricks and playing in the back yard.  Our family took her on CAPS9 we called ""CAPS3 CAPS1,"" to the river to go swim and fish with us. CAPS2 had fun running and splashing with us in the water. We also took her to the coast to play on the beach.We took her everywhere with us, and CAPS2 loved it. CAPS2 was also the only dog at the park that knew CAPS16 to slide. Everyone was so amazed at CAPS9 CAPS2 could do. They had never seen anything like her before.  CAPS3 made many people laugh and smile when they saw her. CAPS2 was my best friend and the smartest dog I knew. From going to the park to slide, camping and swimming to just being a lazy dog, CAPS2 made me laugh. CAPS2's gone now, but her memory still remains. CAPS2 will never be forgotten.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. For one, most drigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so it could explode. For instance, on May 6, 1937 the German drigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. There is no predicting that that could never happen again. The greatest obstacle in attempting drigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and even if it was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Drigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets wasn't practical and not safe. Another reason is because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, due to fear over the wind, blowing the drigible in to other buildings in the area which would puncture the drigible's shell and cause a lot of damage.",0

"The one time when I was paitent was on the CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom dont have pacents you are most likly to fail the CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the CAPS1 CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the CAPS1. I understand that you dont have the CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients!

"I believe that the children of today should be able to read, and learn the same things that our parents have learned in the past. Learning things through the same teachings, books, movies... etc.      Learning things this way would be better then taking out cussing, swaring and certain detailed writing, because if you took all that away its like lieing about history, and what really happend.     Should the children of today be deprived of the truth? Would you want your children going to school everyday and learning things from a text book that were twisted around just so that it was apropriate and non offencive? Think about it... Were you deprived of learning history when you were in school? I didn't think so, so why start now?     Say your child is going to be reading 'ORGANIZATION1' in CAPS1 class today. Would you want to ruin a classic book by taking the 'CAPS2' word and the word 'slave' out of the book? Depriving them of how there use to be slave owners, slaves, and racial comments? Depriving them of actual history? Would you also deprive them from learning about wars, revolutions, and mass killings just to make learning apropriate?     No. I wouldn't.

"All of us have rights, all of us have the same chance to express what we feel, think or believe. Freedom is the most beautiful and important thing we have and nobody can take that away from us: its just something that belongs to ourselves and that everybody does have.     As humans it is not easy to understand othe people's thoughts and it could turn kinda of hard to accept the opinions that extrangers from us can apport.     A library is a place where we can find all kind of material that can easily answer many or our questions, sometimes some material can be offensive and make a target of people feel unconfortable as well as there is material that can be really helpful through our searching.     If i had the right to remove any magazine, book or movie off the shelf, i would at least think about it before remove it and consider how helpful and worth it it could be for someone that really needs it, and if everybody else had the same right as me, the we wouldn't have any material at all in the library.     Music is a big topic to talk about, we all know there are people that are really used to listen to a type of music that other people can call it as 'rude music' and i could be pretty much offensive for kids. I trully believe it wont be fear for any of us to labeled people because of the music they like, the books they read or the movies they watch.      We need to understand nobody is better than nobody and we also need to respect other people's feelings, its something that we have to work on.",0

"Hi im henry and I agree that if there are books in a school libray or a public libray that are offensive they should be removed. im a type of person who belives that offensive books shouldnt be in librays because i ahte seeing people upset or mad  because they read a book that effened them. That inclues magazines and movies and even music.       myself henry has read a few books that has effened my self or has made fun of black people and i have black friends. if I could have it my way i would have all books like that out of school librays and public librays. And i say that because little kids dont need to be reading that kind of stuff and neither do we. thats just like music now days you turn on a radio station and people are cussing and making fun of other colored people. Also you cant understand what there saying half the time. They need to put on music that u can understand that doesnt have cussing in it and that you can understand because some kids like to listen to music.     magazines, I look at alot of magazines my self but there all like coonhunting magazines or four-wheeler ones lookin for tires or somthing like that. but yes also the bad magazines need t go to that way little kids arent looking at them. also it mite help some crime to stop to. I say that because people look at magazines that have shooting in then and that have crime in them to. So people see that and there like i wanna try this somtime. so then they call there buddies and say lets try this and most of them do then there in trouble. so i think that it would be helpful to get all the bad magazines that were made and throw them away and things mite change. make some that have like cartoons in them and comics for the little kids. you could even try and make some good health ones that advertise good health for people and teens. To me things would possibly change if we get all the  naughty things out of book,magazines,music.     Movies, this is a big one just about all the movies are bad. There are some good ones out there if u look. but i dont know how we could change the movies by anycahnce at all.     That was my opion on things. i hope it all makes sense about how i feel and how i think about things.",0

"I think the author of Winter Hibiscus finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because it is showing us the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started.",0

"CAPS1 some beleive computers do not benefil society, I do. Computers help buisnesses thrive, keep people people aware of what is going on in the world, and allow people to stay in touch with each other. Computers greatly benefit small and large buisnesses across the world. Imagine all the jobs at each buisnesses without a computer. Buisnesses would be unreliable because no instant contact would mean it might take a long time for products to be assembled and shipped. Any buisness owner would cringe at the idea of running of buisness without a computer. When surveyed, NUM1 out of NUM2 buisness owners and workers would prefer a computers assistance at work. Almost every modern day buisness relies on at least one computer. For example, companies that mass - produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a worker. Sometimes computer operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk. Buisness also need computers to quickly recieve and send information to other buisnesses and people. Buisnesses are not the only need for computers. People use computers as much if not more, than buisnesses. People like you and me use computers to keep in touch with friend and people we know. Thanks to websites like CAPS2 and e-mail people can easily stay in touch. Families use computers to plan get-togethers. Friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby. With computers, anyone that is anywhere can be in constant contact with anyone else. People also like to know news imediately. Without computers it would be alot harder to contact the rest of the world. Imagine a natural disaster accuring and not knowing about it right away. In that case we could not send aid to the area. With the recent earthquakes in LOCATION1 and LOCATION2. Knowledge about the rest of the world is even more important. Newspapers provide news and information but a day or two late and they often use computers to aquire that information. Eighty-seven percent of scientists agree that recieving information would be a lot harder.",0
"Do you think that computer's are good? Well, I do. There are many reasons why I and you should think, this. For example, it has possitive effect on people, it teaches hand-eye coordination, and it allows people to talk to online with other people. One reason why you should think that computers are good is it has a positive effect on people!! Don't you want to be happy. well then, computers is your online fun source!! And your an learn a lot from computer!! Another reason is that the computers teaches hand-eye coordinbation. Hand-eye coordination is excellent skill that you need in life. For example, lets say that you want to play baseball, and you have no hand-eye coordination and you trip and DATE1 and you brake something. that isn't good for you, is it. No, it is not good. But, if you had better hand-eye coordination then you probably wouldn't have fallen! The NUM1 reason is that, you can interact with others online. You can CAPS1, you can go on chat rooms. Or you can go on gaming sources, and interact with other people!! And, you can go online dating! The computer is a greet way to meet new people that share the same characteristics as you!! If you already have a computer then your fine. But, if you don't then you need to get one. And I am right!! People that don't have a computer have no jb. because people with jobs most of the time have use or have computer. In conclusion, you need to get a computer!! Why? well, that because you can alot of stuff on a computer. For example, you can teach hand eye coordition, and you can chat with online friends. Also, it gives you a possitive effect.",0
"Computers can affect people in many ways. Most people use computers too much and it can affect their health and the peole around them. People need to get out side and get more active. America is becoming obese and not getting any real useful information out of the computer. Some people are just sitting, mind lessly infront of their computer and eating at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True people exercise every day. Being on the computer is not a bad thing, sometimes. Sometimes you need to find something about nature but wouldn't it be easier to go outside and find new think I dont live by the but you can to one all the woods cannot be just gone. Even your front yard is full of nature, and you will be getting some (not all) exercise at the same time. Familys are constantly having problems about family members who never have time to talk and funch holes in walls for losing a video game. Dr. PERSON1 or ""The studies of the human mind"" says ""I found out technology and online gaming increases anger in most people."" That goes to show it can cause problems in familys everywhere because of a video game! So please make sure you try to spend time with your family. So that shows that the computer can be fun, but also dangerous.",0
"The idea of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building seemed like a grand idea at the time of construction, but it had many obstacles to overcome The builders first had to make ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the buildings steel frame. this would reinforce the building against the pressure a dock dirigible would create. Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low. Not to mention the fact builders were a thousand feet high. this idea presented many challenges.",0

"The workers on the Empire CAPS1 Building ran into many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The workers ran into large problems with the safety of docking over a large city. Also, the reality of the construction and location was a future problem for the workers. The process was a troubling challenge overall.It was not very safe to have a large aircraft with passengers hanging over a large city. One percaution that was of great concern was that other dirigibles used hydrogen, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential of having a fire over a city was a risk that they could not face. The dirigibles were not even allowed by law to get close enough to the Empire State Building to dock. The workers had to face reality when it came to the construction and location. The mast was so high up that dirigibles would not be able to dock because of ""violent air currents."" Some blimps did not even have the proper ""mooring equipment installed."" The project al ltogether was unrealistic so therefor it was a great challenge for workers docking dirigibles.",0
"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in th spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph is that what happens to his life that he will take the test again. But in the story it talks about. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it So I think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter.

"Laughter Was One CAPS1'm going to wright my paper on how important laughter is. I believe it can really cure people.

"Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf? But if you had the right to remove the book would you? I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of  music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive. Also, instead of removing the materials completely, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive.     First, noone should have the right to remove materials they find offensive. Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to intertain ourselves. Also it would start a big fight because alot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people dont find offensive, a big riot will start.     secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner? maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if the could make it NUM1 or less vaulger. Same with music, movies, and magazines.     So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not. I think if i came across something that offended me I wouldnt do anything about it. Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves. So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do",0
The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June.

"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from CAPS1: The Blueprints of Our Lives The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cultural and family. The mood is very cultural because they created the home into a cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.

The mood is also family because when someone needed a place to stay from their family they would let them stay at their house.",0
"I think that if u feel like they are sayin bad thing that you should not read the books or magazines and dont lisen to the music and dont look at the moves.          If you feel offensive about it just dont look at it because a porson might not find it offensive.It is port of life to look at something offensive so why do it now. I think that if they do that they might just take some CAPS1.Vs shows off the air becuas there are a lot off shows out there that are offensive and some do not like that but they dont take it off the air so why take books music, movies, and magazines off the shelves.    i dont believe that they should do that at all becuas if i dont like it i dont look at it so i dont get mad at something somebody say bout my believe.    A porson might not like the same music u like i might not like the same music he or she likes but i dont wont to take it off the shelves they should just stop lookin and lisning to all this stuff a porson says about there believe.",0
"I think that removing books from a library that are offensive shouldn't be allowed, first off because people have different taste on the books they read. I also think that the books that the libary carries are educational, they might be offensive to people but sometimes they are good for learning new things about the world around us. Another thing is that a lot of books, movies, music, and magazines might be offensive to you, but if you dont want your child to read those then just keep them away from those types of books at the library, and the people that do want to look at that stuff can. So i think it just depends on what kind of stuff people like, everyone likes something different.      One reason why i think that libraries shouldn't be censored is because some people have different taste in the books they read. Some people like scary books, some people like romantic, so  everyone doesnt all like the same thing. Everyone might be offended of something but people should't let it bother them.      My second reason is because books that they carry at the library are usually educational. They have learner books for the little kids to help them learn how to read, they have magazines for the people that are interested in the drama around the world, then we have war books for the people that are interested in history, so i dont think that people should really be to offended by the books that people read.      Another reason is that if you dont want your child or a looking at the books or ect. That might look offensive to you then dont let them read them, everyone likes different things, and if you take away things that other people like then your just offendending them too. Thats why people that enjoy to go to the library should't take things so offensive, so we don't have to censor things at the library.     So thats why i think that libraries shouldn't have to be censored at all because people have different taste in the books that they read, that books that libraries carry are usually educational, and if you don't want your child looking at those kind of books then don't let them read them. People need to undrstand that some books aren't always trying to offend people, but the ones that are they are just trying to state there own optinon",0

"Based on the memoir the mood created by the author in the memoir was filled with lots of love and satisfaction. It was filled with love and satisfaction because Narciso and family loves everyone for who they are. People from all over came and be apart of the family and it was alright with them. It said in paragraph NUM1 that growing up in there environment instilled in them a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In there neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. They were all proud and happy with everyone coming together as a family. In paragraph NUM2 Narciso said that he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Narciso had a loving mood because he is grateful for what his parents done for him. Last but not least in paragraph NUM3 Narciso also had a mood of love and thankfulness because he learned the real definition of family and love. Narciso proclaimed, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.",0
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a good mood. It is a good mood and it also explains the hardships along the way, such as moving from cuba to the united States.

Their is a nice attitude towards everything through good times and bad always a good attitude. Narciso's parents let family and friends over for dinner all the time for cuban cooking and music. Every One has such a great attitudes. This selection has a soft, nice, and good mood.",0
"I believe that with too much use of computer it will have bad affects on people. People can get addicted to it so easily. They also use a lot of electricity. And people sit on the computer all day and don't exercise at all. These are all bad affects computers have, but their not all bad, without them life might be a little harder. Playing computer games, and online poker sounds fun right? Wrong! People get addicted to them everyday. Online poker could be dangerous. I remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it. He'd put his credit card information in and sit and play all day. Before he knew it, he was in debt. Once he was addicted it was very hard for him to stop. It's a stupid thing to get into because there is no point to it. You sit and waste money, especially with our economy the way it is. A recent study shows that PERCENT1 of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks. Other games are also addicting too. There's a website that called addicting. I guess people don't know the affects of being addicted to a computer has on them and their family. Did you know that PERCENT2 of electricity in LOCATION1 goes to computer? Thats almost half of it going to one thing. I don't think it's right that pretty much everything is done on the computer now. In our economic chrisis I don't think enery should be wasted playing computer games. We could use energy for more important things that people any need. If everyone didn't need computers to communicate and everything there wouldn't be a problem. The number of computers sold has gone up PERCENT3 since DATE1. I understand emailing, and facebook. But don't get out of hand with it. Isnt being outside on a beautiful day great? Wouldn't you rather enjoy that or excercise rather than sitting glued to a computer? Obesity is a huge problem in LOCATION1. A lot of people are obese from sitting on the computer and not excercising. I remember when I was younger, everytime I went to my friends house, his dad would be sitting and playing poker and games on the computer. He was very out of shape and lazy. His parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person. Most CAPS1 are lazy. We don't like to do work if we don't have to. I would define they rather excersise or go outside instead of being on the computer. You live a lot healthier when you're not addicted to the computer. And when you're healthier, you're happier. So in conclusion, if you don't control yourself on the computer it can have bad affects. Computers are easy to get addicted to, use a lot of electricity, and can make people fat and lazy. Do you think playing computer games is worth losing friends and family?",0

"While building the Empire State Building many obstacles had occurred. During the process of planning the CAPS1 of the building architects started to realize that there could be many complications.Several complicostions occurred during the process. Architects noticed that the building itself was not made to add additional parts. As an architect said ""it could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Wind was another harsh factor for the construction of the Empire State Building itself. If ""held by a single cable tether, it would add Stress to the buildings frame. The engineers will also muched with the building's issues."" the Steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.Safety and nature also had a big play in the obstacles of the building of the Empire State Building. Architects planned out to maintain the dirigibles very high up. wanting to do this could be very dangerous. ""dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe. Building the dirigible would have caused many accidents, injuries, and deaths if made. Nature would also be inroled in this plan. ""open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights. If anyday had very fierce winds this object could have came down and caused serious danger.",0

In conclusion, that's the mood I think the CAPS1 created and some reasons why.",0
"The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced was many things surrounding safety and money issues. Successfully docking the dirigible would mean spending over MONEY1 more, to make arrangements to the building.

"In the story Winter Hibiscus the author CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her  gentle grandmother from her first home. CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why CAPS1 the ended the story Winter Hibiscus  with the paragraph selected.",0

"To CAPS1 it MONTH1 CAPS2:     CAPS3 I walk into a library, I want to be able to think I am in a peaceful place where I can find books that are helpful for what I need and are not harmful to anyone. Anywhere I go I want to feel like a free person and shouldn't have to worry about things that will hurt others or myself. People are people and everyone should be treated the same. It doesnt matter what color your skin is, the way you look, or how you talk. Everyone should be treated equaly. I believe if there is something offensive in a movie, magazine, books, or anything to any kind of people it should be removed for good. It doesnt matter what the past was like. The present is all that matters and in my opinion everyone deserves the same.      I beleive that no one in this world should feel ashamed of who they are. If someone is CAPS4 CAPS5 they should be proud of it and shouldn't be afraid of negative things that would hurt their feelings. I think most people would agree CAPS3 I say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same. Negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good. We do not need things like that in our world. That is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs. Our world shouldn't concist of bad things that will hurt the lives of others. Anything that is negative to a person or group of people shouldn't be allowed and should be thrown away. Inacent people do not deserve what people received in the past. The past has nothing to do with what is going on in the present. Right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that. I treat people the way I want to be treated and that should go for everyone. Harmful things need to be removed from everything. We do not need things like that in our world. People should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are.     In conclusion I beleive that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive. Everyone is who they are and that shouldn't have an effect on others and the way they live. People should feel proud to be here and not scared of things that could impact their lives forever. Harmful things are not good in this world and shouldn't have an impact on others.

The first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature. With high speed air currents would cause ""the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" If the dirigible was unable to dock correctly, the dangers would be the fact it was ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, (which) was neither practical nor safe."" Another problem the builders encountered was the already existing law that made sure airships don't fly too low over cities. The author notes, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of mother nature and pre-existing legislature, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome enigmatic problems.",0

"I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was always laughing and giggling. As I have grown up, I have tried to keep up my happy-go-lucky spirits. Sometimes this was not the case, but that is simply reality. There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always came through, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about. When I was first born, I didn't cry. I never cried very much as a baby. My mom reminds me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me! I was always looking for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a beat! My mom would have to take drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fell asleep. For if I did, CAPS1 forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I was laughing with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I loved the feeling laughing with other people. I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kid's baby pictures. In every baby picture of me, I'm laughing. If I'm not laughing, then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never felt that type of feeling before. I was always so caught up in laughter that I never had time to think about the negative. Now, I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I attempt this, I can always find laughter, and my spirits are brought back up. My friends are always a place I can go to for a pick me up. Especially PERSON1, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. PERSON1 and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept LOCATION1 and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: LOCATION1, CAPS2, and PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was gravitated towards those who I had the most fun with, and who I laughed with the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking is still there; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious!  Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!",0

"I think computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons for my answer is that there are many homework helper websites, the computer helps you learn about places you've never been to, and you can even interact with people all around the world. These are my three reasons on why I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers have a positive effect on people because there are many homework helper websites that struggling students can go on and get tutored. I remember in NUM1 grade when I had a math midterm. I was having a hard time understanding the math. Then, I went on a tutoring websites and they taught me everything that I was having trouble with. I think that the computer can help many kids obtain good grades. This is my first reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Second, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it can help you learn about far away places that you have never been to before. This would be useful for a school project on a country. Also PERCENT1 of students in my school say that the computer ha s helped them a lot on school projects. The computer could also be useful for planning a vacation. Would you want to vacation to a place that you know nothing about? That is where the computer can help. All you have to do is search your destination and pictures and info will come up so you can make the right choice. This is my second reason why I think omputers have a postive effect on people. Lastly, I think computer have a positive effect on people becuase you can interact with people around te world. I have a brothter that lives in florida, but I can talk to him every day on the computer. Also, I can keep in touch with my friends anytime I want. I think computers help people develop better social skills. This is my last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, I think computers have a postive effect on people for better grades, learn different things, and talk to friends.",0
"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up.",0
"What is censorship? Cenorship can be described as limitations or restrictions, and it can aslo be called common courtsy. The real question is what are we limiting?   Censorship is not something to support. Censorship to a book is like chocolate cake without the chocolate, its taking away the value and fun out of education. Though many MONTH1 disapprove, libraries shouldn't censor their books, movies, or music because of that.      Some MONTH1 find that 'CAPS1 CAPS2' or 'The CAPS3 of PERSON1' are offensive books because of their repeated use of the 'CAPS4' word. There is also some arguement to that, there are several CAPS5 CAPS6 that I know that find the 'CAPS4' word offensive, but not in this case. They say that it brings more educational value to the book, because in the day of PERSON1 the 'CAPS4' word was an excepted word. Thats just how it was back then.     Back then and now censorship is hiding reality. People who write, sing, and direct things that are considerd 'inapropriate' are the ones who are trying to set the truth free. The 'inapropriate' language, or experiences are the ones that really happen and are the words that are really said. By using censorship you are sheltering the world.      Cesorship is tool we use to block ourselves from reality. Is that the right choice? Is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves? Or should we let them understand how it really works",0
"The builders of the Empire stat building encountered both man made problems and problems from nature while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was the buildings strength. The building's steel was not nearly strong inef to ""transmite pressure from the dirigibe's load to the buildings foundation."" Also ""the winds at the top of the building were always moving and full of violent air currents,"" which would shove the Zeppelin into the edges of the building. It was prohibited for airships to fly too low over urban areas, and so making it illegal for a ship to even dock to the building. Price was also a factor, along with the buildings cost an additional sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework just to make the building strong inuf to accommodate an airship. Through all of those problems the builders encountered no wonder dirigibles docking at the mooring mast was not possible.",0
"CAPS1 you want people to be so memorized by a computer that they miss out in the world around them? CAPS1 you want the kids in LOCATION1 to spend hours each day on the computers playing games while they could be outside getting fresh air? The question then is, CAPS1 computers have good effects or bad effects on people. The obvious answer is bad effect. People constantly use the computers teach them bad habbits and can search inappropriate things. IF people are always playing games the computers then when CAPS1 they go out for a jag. The answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer don't get enough exercise. One reason why a lot of people in LOCATION1 are obese is because they aren't getting enough exercise. Computers aren't helping this situation at all. Some people say, ""CAPS2 I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I will go work out."" But, the one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three, you know it you've wasted the wrote day on the computer and didn't exercise at all. Also, there are so many games on the computer now that can be really and you don't to stop playing them. Yes some games can be really entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go get air. As you can computer can mesmorised a lot so they don't get enough exercise. Second, people go on bad habbits. For example, kids are always. On the website you can talk to your friends. On the computer the problem is that people dont use the. Too much and get too used writing like that. Then, kids MONTH1 start doing that on writing in school and most even know it. Also, there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to. learn your. Lastly is very easy for people, even to search inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search inappropriate words ad pictures and no one would ever know. people can past inappropriate information on their own for others to see that can be impossible to take. And, if parents don't know that their children are searching inappropriate things, then the kids are going to keep doing it because they know they wont get caught. So, as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people. It causes individuals to no easy to inappiopriate things. So go and limit the time you on computer.",0

"In my opinion,  I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people. There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society can not sensor everything are because of the fact that not everone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is comprimised if the choices we have are limited.      When someone gets offeneded by the media that is out there, that does not neccessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censorded because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic.          Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censoreship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. Whe children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then their would not be any books left. I believ in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well.      Individualaity is when one person has differnt traits of feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the musice we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to thnk that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them differnt because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases.      Also from experience I have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understading, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In the future, when I find a book that MONTH1 not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, MONTH1 be seen as a good thing to another.",0

"Many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. So should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? I believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what.     I know that a certain case, specific to me, is that my mother did not like me reading a specific series becasue she thought that it was not an appropriate reading material for me. Because of that, that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author. She respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read.     In many libraries, I know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults. Within those specific designated areas, they have kind of 'sub-area' where they seperate educational from entertainment and so on. Let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely? I do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children.     I do believe that libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is aloud to look at them and be able to check them out. An eight year old should not be able to go in and get a NUM1 movie whenever they want to. There should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the NUM1 movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment.    Libraries to respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible. They will have children's videos seperate from the adult videos and they even have a whole seperate section of books for them to discover and journey into. The only thing that I believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. A library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentily stumble upon any raunchy article.     So, should libraries completely remove areas of media? I do not think so. I think that they should distinguish from adult's and children's materials. Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf . . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read.",0
"The snow shimmered in the sunlight like sequins. CAPS1 and I rushed to her bedroom window to get a better look. A blanket of white covered the ground. Quickly we strapped ourselves into air-restricting snowsuits. She opened the wooden front door and the chilly air stung my nose. CAPS6 we hurried out into any NUM1 graders paradise. CAPS1 and I had both been through some rough times in the past few months. I shielded myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a giant bolt of light and a loud thunder clap. CAPS1 had just learned her parents were getting a divorce. Being best friends, we had been through a trail of tears that year, but all was forgotten when our legs hit the cold wet snow. We raced to her garage in panic to find sleds. As we ran through the house to the back door we were stopped by CAPS1's short tan mom. She refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast. We chomped down a bowl of the always tasty CAPS2 CAPS3 and gulped down a tall glass of juice. CAPS6 we flew out the back door with our sleds. There the giant hill waited for us. It slopped downward in a perfect NUM2 degree angle with only a few turns. The wood piles and thorny blackberry bushes that lined our sledding course taunted us. As my eyes wandered down the path of snow I heard CAPS1 yell, ""CAPS5!"" CAPS6 I saw her whipping her way down the slope. I grabbed my red racer sled and took off after her. I approached my first turn. It hooked around left like the start of a figure eight. With ease I glided around the corner and saw a snapshot of the woodpile that sat on my right. I looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun shone through slivers of the trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on ice.  Confidently I approached my second turn. I spun around the corner sharply. I stared up ahead to see CAPS1's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. That was when my eyes caught a glimpse of her neighbors bay horse and all my happiness floated away. As I got lost in my thoughts about LOCATION1, I also lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow as if it were concrete. My legs tangled into knots and I could feel my head pounding. The sled had abandoned me. I tumbled down the hill like an avalanche. Eventually, the kind hands of a blackberry bush reached out to stop me. The thorns stabbed my neck. Carefully, I plucked each thorn from my neck and retreated to the bottom of the hill by foot.  By the time I reached my final destination, CAPS1 couldn't breath. With her head buried in the snow, her abs were bouncing up and down with the rhythm of her laugh. She looked up at me, her bright green eyes and flushed pink cheeks told me how silly I had looked tumbling down the hill. She started to laugh one last time when a giant snot bubble burst out of her nostril. She started to crack up and I fell to the ground in a burst of laughter. I couldn't look at her anymore. Every time I glanced in her direction it became even more funny. I nudged my head into the snow just as she had done earlier. Finally when we had ourselves under control we looked up at each other. Our mascara was smeared around our eyes and down our cheeks. We resembled either clowns with a horrible makeup job or strange looking raccoons. Our laughs started to grow again, but quickly died down. Together we stood up. We spotted my bright red sled down by the frozen pond. ""CAPS9 like a nice hike,"" I said. CAPS6 we both started on our journey through the forest to retrieve it.  When I came shooting down the hill like a meteor, and she shot that snot bubble out of her nose like a rocket ship, I forgot everything. It was the first time in months that both of us felt at ease with our hardships. Laughter is the biggest connection we have with each other. When I laughed, my mind shut out the whole world. On snow days we now laugh to remember that cold DATE2 day, but on that DATE1 day we were laughing to forget.",0

"In the excerpt, some obstacles they faced were that the building was the tallest in the world at 1,250 ft. like it says in paragraph NUM1. Another problem they encountered was the dirigibles were unsafe. The Hindenburg, an event where a helium filled dirigible had caught fire, occured during construction.

"What if some one found your favorite book offensive? Inapporate materials do need to be kept from young minds of children.On the other hand, you can not sheild people from things they should know or already know. Everyone has different things that they think are offensive, so one person might think a book is so bad it should be recalled from the shelves but an another person MONTH1 see no problem with it.     Children need to be protected from materials that MONTH1 hurt them in some way. Children do what they see and hear, so they are liable to try and cop harmful things they read . Bad influences can be even magazines with famous celeberties being caught breaking the  law or doing bad things and young minds see that as 'cool' and MONTH1 try to follow tha example.     Children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home, television and even at school than in some books. Children need to be protect but, you can't baby proof life. They willl be introduced to plenty of bad influnces in there life time but, it should be the parent's job to teach their kids to say no and stay away from bad things. Kids can learn so much worse things from something at the library by just setting at home.     Libraries are places for use public and the public covers a wide amount of different kinds of people and someone will always find something bothersome with somting or another. People have different views, believes and religions, and, books on these might be offensive to some but, the life style of another. Like The  quote by Katherine Paterson, said if we take off the shelves every book or material that somone finds offensive there will be no books in the libraries at all.     Yes, there are books that are not always very presentable to a certain group of people but, they should have a right to be read if their is someone who wants to read them. It is not the librarys job to be prejudice against certain books for because someone does't agree with it. Books should be a wide varitey like the people who are reading them. Also children are protect from books if they have learned morals that allow them to make mature choices",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles. Starting in paragraph NUM1 the aspiration of the mast on the Empire State Building made the plan seem well put together and it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed many details went looked over and when the dirigibles were ready to take action the plan was not something forageable. Stated in paragraph NUM2, safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States, because they contained the flamable gas hydrogen. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occuring in a  highly populated area. Another obsticle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself as presented in paragraph NUM3. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end. This made it unsafe for passengers to get on and of and also the cargo. The greatest obstacle for dirigibles trying to dock on the Empire State Building is the existing law against flying too low over urban areas, which is found in paragraph NUM4. By a dirigible docking it would be directly breaking the law.",0

"I have recently heard about many arguments based on computers ruining society. I strongly disagree with this. I think the computer is a great way to hook up with old friends. The internet is also faster for research than looking in a book and there are many games on the internet. I believe that the internet is a great way to hook up with old friends. Some people have moved away and I haven't been able to talk to then. Now, with the internet I can able to talk again. The same case with my mom. She had friends from high school and college who she ever talked to. Now, with facebook she has re united with them. This also helps because you can email someone interested of sending a letter in the mail, which costs money, unlike email. So the internet can also be a way of saving money. It is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter. The internet is a great way to keep intouch with friends and relatives. I also believe that the use of computer is more efficient than doing to a library and researching a book. If you don't have enough time to go the to a library, you can do some research at your house. What if the library is closed if you do go, then you wasted some time. The internet never closes, it is open NUM1. What if you go to the library and they are open, but do hot have a book on your subject? This can also be done on the internet because there is any thing you could ever ask for on the internet. If you have an over due library book you can renew the book on the internet. The internet is a great place research on any topic you have or doing what ever you want. Finally, the computer is great for playing about every game, there is that you would feel like playing. Also CAPS1 of spending about MONEY1 on an x-box and a game, you MONTH1 only have to spend about MONEY2 on a game that goes into your computer. There are also many websites that have games on them. Some websites are for specific games, and same have many games on them. Only a few of the games are interactive with other players and you can talk and make new friends. On the other hand, many games are only for one player. As a result, a computer is a great use to play games. In conclusion, I believe the computer is great need for our society. In the long run it will pay off, especially with the economics problems our country is having now, by helping us save money,. It will also allow connection with old friends, save time, and provide entertainment to all who would like.",0
"The author concludes this the story with this paragraph   because its start a whole new  day time . That saying  means  that  she  will  take  the  test on a budding  new day .for  example, the   geese  return  her its spring and  hibiscus budd  and  she  has the test  in  the spring  so it  will  start  why the author concludes the  story  with that paragraph.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. As stated, modifications had to be made to the building's framework strengthen and accommodate the new situation. Another great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were consulate shifting due to violent air currents."" This would leave the dirigibles swiveling any air above pedestrians which was neither practical or safe. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles during the project which unfortunately led to the known fact that the Empire State Building was never going to fulfill its purpose.",0
"CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the LOCATION1? Well I CAPS2. People are on the NUM1. We need to CAPS2 something about these computers. They are preventing people from exercising, going outside, are are just making them stay in there house all day. One reason I think we should get rid of computers is because people aren't getting there exercise. the computer, next to the LOCATION2, is probably the number one thing that makes people fat. Kids are sometimes on the computer all day eating snacks and junkfood when they should be eating healthy fruits and vegetables. You could. Almost CAPS2 anything on the computer that you CAPS2 in your everyday life, that's how good technology is. The computer is the thing that gets people addicted to something. The computer has games, internet, and ways to talk to people that get then attached. A second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket. When you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one, because the salesman talks then into it. Most people don't know what kind of computer they are supposed to buy, so they buy the most expensive one because they think the more, the better. Also just buying the computer isn't all of it. When you download softwares, games, and moble things that all cost money. Downloading one thing can cost up to one hundred dollors. plus, most people can't afford these downloads after buying themselves a pricy computer. My third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waist of time. People spand hours on the computer doing stupid stuff, like playing games and talking to the, when they should all be outside enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is very important to your health. Next time your on the computer doing something that doesn't need to be done, go outside. Think about it, hour often CAPS2 you go outside? My guess, not much. Now CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the LOCATION1? They are making people fat, not getting there exercise, eating junk food and play games all day long on this stupid piece of technology. Instead of being on the computer all day why don't you think about going air you need. Also you don't want to be waisting all of your hardworked money on a stupid piece of technology. Plus, you don't want to deal with softwares and there viruses. My advice, computers are terrible.",0
"The author concludes the story with this parapraph because it ties it all together. I think that the author uses. it also to say that in the spring she will pass the test. I really like the part when she says ""in the spring, when the snows melt."" I like that because it explains what she wants and how she puts her mind to it.",0
"I have been patient many time here are a few of them. First, I was patient for my friend. I patient with him because we were going to walk to school. He told me one minute, but it was more like twenty. We barely made it to first hour. Another way I was patient was when my mom and I went to go get my new shoes from ORGANIZATION1. When my mom and I were waiting the man in the store went to go get the shoes. The man walked back there and took like a half an hour. But it was worth it for my new shoes. These are only a few ways I was patient.",0
"Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. This iron clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with ORGANIZATION1. One DATE1 TIME1, my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over meet her children. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous occasion. My obsessive compulsive mother made me change clothes at least thirty times before she deemed me presentable enough to meet the man whose existence I was beginning to despise. At precisely six thirty in the TIME2, PERSON1's blue ORGANIZATION2 pulled into our driveway. I shot my mother a steely eyed glare as I opened the door for the buffoon; thus, a most dreaded dinner began.  My determined hatred began to soften as soon as I saw PERSON1, but it was by no means expired. PERSON1 was tall and tan, a few years older than my mother judging by his wrinkle strewn skin and the silver streaked through his dark hair and matching mustache. He had the sort friendly, pleasant appearance that makes him immediately likable. My now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger. My younger sister warmed up to him first. She and PERSON1 share a love of snakes, lizards and all things I deem ""creepy crawly."" A common interest brought them together before I knew it. My older sister adored PERSON1 after a lively conversation about football ensued. PERSON1 and my sister discovered they were both CAPS1 fans, and consequently formed a bond over their team.  After winning my siblings over, PERSON1 tried to charm me into liking him to. He attempted to talk of movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nut nothing he said could melt my icy disposition. I was determined to hate him from the start of the TIME2, and no amount of charisma would break my persistent stubbornness. Eventually he gave up on me, and focused on entertaining the people who did like him. Over dessert he jumped into a stand-up comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to LOCATION1. He went on about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who really hate their job, and the corny safety videos. I had tears of laughter in my eyes before I remembered that I had made a solemn vow to loath PERSON1. I fought hard to resume my former demeanor, but my will did not stand a chance against ORGANIZATION1's sense of humor. The triumphant smile and slick wink he shot me from across the table told me that he had won. Sure enough, we were the best of friends before the night ended.   Eventually PERSON1 and I conversed about movies and music and found we had similar tastes in both, but our common interests had nothing to do with our friendship. They simply fueled the fire. The power of laughter brought us together like a magnet and a washer. Just as the shortest distance between to points is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between myself and PERSON1. He and my mother are still together, and ever since he came into our lives, laughter has been our constant companion.",0
"To use computors, or not to. That is the question. Hundreds of millions of people use computors in their daily life today, but some believe that using computors does not benefit society. It is my firm beleif that they do. Computors provide entertainment, a way to interact with people, and a nearly endless expand of knowledge. Without them, we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate. Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on CAPS1? Well I have on many ocations. When that happens, all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips. You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games. (this can also help improve your hand-eye coordination). You can also watch movies or CAPS1 shows that you missed or want to watch again. You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net, and read or write your own stories! Another reason why computers benifit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far away family members and friends using webcams email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone. You can also meet new people from different countries and become their. That way you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also quickly contact people in an emergency get updates on events, and comunicate with your teacher if you have a question about your homework. Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, computers are on enormous source of knowledge. Say you wanted to learn how to start a campfire, you could just search, ""how make fire"" a google and NUM1 matches would be found seconds. Also, if you were asigned a project for school, you could do all of your research easily from your computor, then type the whole thing up on a word document. You can even get a college degree online if you wished. And if you want to find a resturant that specializesin CAPS2 cooking, you can find one close to you, get directions to it, look at the menu, see the prices get the restaurant's history, cud find reveiws for it all on one magnificent little choice: your computer. So you see, computors benifit society greatly. In fact I don't think we could live without them. They provide us with entertainment, an easy way to interact with people, and a huge source of information. Now, to all of you people who still think computors are bad; I'd like to see you lost a week without using one.",0
"A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didnt understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didnt go with science, and he didnt listen to anything so he was correctly but he lost it! I couldnt beleive he lost all of our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him. After three days we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it he presented it and got an A+ on it; CAPS1 he got an A+ on it, it made me feel so good and I got rewarded for my hard work and me being patient with him. To the end being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient.",0

"Computers are used world wide everyday, and most of the time CAPS2 is used for a good reason. Computers help out by making CAPS2 possible to get all the info you want, like for a trip. CAPS1 you wanted to go to a close but fancy restaurant you MONTH1 use a computer so you know how far. Computers also help out, making CAPS2 possible to talk to friends that you haven't seen for years. CAPS2 is also great way to meet new people. Let's say you are really stressed at work or school and you forget your book, you can usually bring CAPS2 up on the computer and do CAPS2 there. First, computers help out with traveling, sight seeing and lots more. When you travel, dont you want to know everything? And the biggest detail you want to know is the cost and the computer can usually give you a close to exact price for everything. Now that help's out a bunch when your traveling the world. And also when your site seeing you usually want to find either the most amazing or romantic spot were you are. And CAPS1 you type in ""the most romantic spot in somers"" CAPS2 should come up with a bunch of spots. So dont drive to miles just to get a map or brochure, use your computer and print one off. Second, CAPS1 there was a friend you haven't seen in years and you want to talk, you can go on the computer. The computer helps in so many ways CAPS2 could even tell you were this person lives and you could surprise visit himher. When your on the computer, you can even meet new friends and have conversations with them. and even meet them someday. And CAPS1 you and that new friend get along then mabey you and that person could be best friends. So CAPS1 you haven't seen or talked to someone in a while that you knew use the computer to have a chat. Third, say your teacher or boss yelled at you today and no one has been nice to you all day and you forget your homework book or paperwork. Were do you go? the computer, CAPS2 can bring most any paper work or work book you need to get the job done. CAPS1 you forgot your homework book, you dont want to get a falling grade. on this homework. So you go to your computer from there. And CAPS1 you forgot your paper work, and CAPS1 you didn't finish this project for work tonight you would be fired, you could just go on the computer, find the work and finish CAPS2. Also save your job. So that why computers help out so much in this lifetime. Last, that is why in this lifetime you need computers. They help us with our vacation trips. They help with conversation with old friends we haven't seen forever. Also they help with your school and job work. At least PERCENT1 of our population use computers every day and with out them our society would colaps DATE1. So think about the decision you are making and CAPS1 CAPS2 will benefit our society or make our society DATE1 to its knees.",0
"I am not a patient person at all. But sometimes I have to be like my birthday for instance, I would love it if my birthday came at least every month. But of course, I only have NUM1 birthday a year, so I have to wait. I would like to be a patient person. Its just not in the cards for me. My father on the other hand is more patient than anyone. I know he will tell me to clean the car DATE1 I told him I didnt do it yet so he says he will give me more time. I couldnt be that patient with my kids. I would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded. I wouldnt force them to or anything but Im not gonna wait a whole month before I get my car cleaned! I guess I could try to be as patient with my father but that would be really hard. Although if Im patient, Im sure I will be able to do it!",0

Saeng realized that life isn't so bad for her. The planting of the winter hibiscus represented her change as well. It showed how she will start new and continue happily.

"Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For whatever reason, humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh as well. But that reminds me of a funny story... There was this time that I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test was very much like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them were about as vague as they could possibly be, and this made picking one rather challenging. After staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes or so, I began to silently laugh at my situation: I have to write about one of four things when not a single one was even remotely interesting. For some reason, I found my problematic situation amusing, as I am kind of weird that way. But then it hit me... one of the four topics was about laughter... why not write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation? Yes, all I had to do was tell a true story about a time I laughed, so I used this delightful vagueness to my advantage. The topic did not state that the laugh had to be an actually audible one, nor did it state what kind of laugh it had to be, so I figured a silent laugh at irony would do just as well as an audible laugh at something silly.  So now I had my topic. To make things even more amusing, as I wrote about myself laughing at the fact that I had to write about myself laughing, I began to laugh at how silly the task I was carrying out was. However, I began to worry that whoever is grading these things MONTH1 not find this as amusing as I did, which would perhaps hurt my grade. But that possibility served only to make the situation even more ironic, and consequently amusing.  You MONTH1 think that I am easily amused, but to that I must say: well, yeah, I kind of am. I can find almost anything amusing, but that, I find, is the beauty of laughter. It is so abstract, that each and every person experiences it in differently. Some people MONTH1 find very simple things considerably amusing, but others MONTH1 be not so easily amused. These differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable. As I said before, humans like to laugh, and we like to make other people laugh with us. And regardless of the way you MONTH1 interpret laughter's abstract form, you've got to admit: it's kind of funny.",0
"Patience is not a natural thing, it's something you have to learn. Taking a three hour carride is a perfect example of patience. Exactly like what I experienced. As we packed our suitcases for CAPS1 city, I CAPS2't contain myself. I was already packed up but mom and dad were standing. ""CAPS3 you please finish packing see I really want to go! "", I exclaimed ""You'll just have to wait a minute, ""Do ?? But I CAPS2't wait, so I grabed??, threw them in the trunk of our car, and walked to our kitchen to finish reading a book while they packed. After they finished cooking dad was carrying the last of the bags CAPS4 their bedroom to the complain he notice me, setting patiently at the look.

"A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didnt just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting bunch of coins wont change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldnt think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I dont think that Ill be able to count my coins again, but like they say, Patience is a virtue.",0
"Are you a patient person? Well Im not! Well, I can be patient I just wont like to be. A few years ago my family got a gordon setter puppy. Since theyre kind of rare in LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. its hard to handle on puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them NUM1! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didnt want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is.",0
"CAPS1 I am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of LOCATION1. This doesn't seem like a big problem to some, but a very major problem for others. Censorship has removed books, music, magazines, movies, and other things, from the shelf of local stores and libraries for being offensive to the seller or workers.     Its not what some store owners or library owners like in some cases, but its not about what they like. Its about the people in general that have a certian intrest towards that subject. Some people have even removed the CAPS2 from local library systems.      Does it even matter what the owner wants to sell? In most cases, no. The belief in a religon or even a book, magazine, or movie that had one small comment about; sex, drugs or alchol is removed for just that. If we remove everything about any of that, the only thing left CAPS3 be childrens books. Some people CAPS3 find ways to get those censored as well. We CAPS3 become illiterate without books, magazines and other things of that nature.     Theres even an account of a person being fired from there job for reading a magazine on there break at work! What happens if we all listen to another person that wishes to remove a book off the shelf? Then another and another, we CAPS3 have no books in our libraries or stores.      This censorship is a major problem, very few people really care about this subject. Most think it should be done to most items, some think we dont need to censor anything, as we are a free country.      So newspaper editor, please question yourself, ask yourself, 'CAPS3 I like to have all of my favorite magazines, books, and movies gone forever, never to be seen again?' Then everyone will know the answer.",0
"CAPS1 The bell had finally rang and it was time for lunch. It felt like math class would never end. I rushed to lunch without even stopping at my locker. When I got there, there was a line for lunch that seemed like it stretched for a mile. I knew I was going to have to be patient. I got in the huge line. I stood there and waited. Every minute felt like an hour, but I understood that it was a very busy lunch day, so I justed waited. Several minutes later, I was near the front of the line. All of the sudden, seven girls just cutted in front of the line because their friend let them. Even though that made me angry, I didnt complain and stayed patient. I soon got my lunch. In conclusion, that was the time I was patient. I was understanding and did not complain.",0
"I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere. If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them. People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music. People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the languauge used in songs. This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive. I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive. I have had a lot of family members say that i shouldnt be listening to such music because of the language.     Some people say that reading certain things is a prefferance, but what if you are sitting in a doctors' office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around. If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down. You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive. The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you. Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine. Sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it.      Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occation. Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama. Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies. Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor. There are just alot of types of movies out there and its not the producers fault that we do not like it. People make different movies because everyone is not alike. Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie and what you could do to help that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them. I think that cencorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere.",0
"Libraries should never remove any material just because it MONTH1 be found offensive.  Something that is offensive to one person MONTH1 not be to another.  If the material was so offensive that it went against the law, then it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place.       People often get offended if they read, see, or listen to something that goes against their personal views, ethics, or religion.  But people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values.  Though peoples' opinions differ, each opinion is equally important to that certain person.     So many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions.  As a student I often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored.  I am not complaining about this because I understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to.  But if I am looking for something maybe more religious, derogoratory, or less accepted, it is nice to have a public library where I can find these things.       In closing, if people are offended by something on the shelves of a library then they shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it.  But do not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them",0
"Patience is a very important virtue. It is valued in at least these NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, itll always matter. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have.",0
"There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out.  It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting.  The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on.  The book, titled CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it.  Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them.  Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.      Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses.  Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides?  Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading.  If we remove books that MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world.       Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives.  We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music.  If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not.  The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.     In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders.  The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective.  If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public",0
I think the author includes this because she doesnt want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then I will take the test again. This quote is saying she MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you dont no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.,0
"It was some day in DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy.",0
"""Laughter"" I once heard a man say "" laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh you aren't healthy"" CAPS1 do people love to laugh? Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since CAPS2 CAPS3.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it MONTH1 be funny. Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you. Laughing MONTH1 make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it MONTH1 make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game. Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my CAPS4 died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my CAPS5 PERSON1's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life.",0

"enjoying the nature, and interacting with family and friends. In my opinion I think you should know the compouter because it helps for school homework or projects, talking to family far away and finding new friends. My first reason why we should keep computers is because it MONTH1 help on school homework or projects. This is my top reason because its really helpful and its useful when you need it also if your computer its not working you can go to your friends house and use computers, when your done you can save on hardrive and print it in your school's computers. My segond reason why you should keeps computer is talking to family. Without the computer you can't communicate with family. In my opinion computers are very helpful to cummnicate with family. If your phone is not working you can also use the computer to communicate with your family. My third reason is communicating and find new friends without the who are you going to meet and communicate with you can communicate with your family throught the computer, or even if your running late you can send them a message through the computer. In my opinion I think the computer its a really good way to communicate with your family. I know that people say they spend to much time in the computers and its addicting, but its good for school work like projects and assignments, also people said its just to what on the but in my opinion we should keep computers because its no to see whats on the other person. Its to do school work and talk to family. I know people spend to much time in computers but to other people its not. In my opinion, we should not get rid off computers because it good for doing school work and talking with family. I think what you should do its not get rid off computers.",0

The builders had to go through many obstacles to CAPS1 to allow the dirigible to dock on the ORGANIZATION2. The first thing that was a problem with geting it to the top of the Empire State Building. They said the wind made it really hard to get the dirigible up there with out it poping. There was also the safty of it being up there. There was already a fire from another dirigible catching on fire. The gases inside are really flamable and that would make a really big problem. The last thing that they had to conider was if Airships were to Low. The dirigible would pop. for all those reason they had to concider them to CAPS1 to allow the dirigible on the Empire State Building.,0
"I thank that all of the books and movies and more should not  be censorship because people have a right to no what they what to no or see.      They need to learn from books so people can learn from history and so that CAPS1 war NUM1 want happen again.     The libraries is for freeom to read to do want you want and look up.

What impact does books that are for mature people have on kids? Recently people are trying to censorship libraries for what they seen what their kids are reading or have been acting lately. I disagree in censorshiping in libraries. Instead of censorshiping libraries maybe have a section for explict books or things for preventing little kids from reading them.     First of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age. Make a section in at the back of the library and ask for CAPS1 to confirm that there old enough.This would let the libarary keep all their books and would keep all their construmers happy and the most important keep the parents happy.     Another reason for not censorship libraries would be that the number of construmers would slowing drop. This would make the construmers unhappy and the library drop on its popularity for not having the books that people want to read.     I can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors. With censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book. But CAPS2 would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy.     At the end I disagree in censorshiping libraries because CAPS2 would upset the people who read them and probably the library poplurity would drop which means people would stop visiting the library. So people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now,0
"I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that flew down south in a beautiful CAPS1 formation, fly down every season. So she tells herself, CAPS2, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. CAPS2, looking up at the geese she is almost reminded of an experience she went through somewhat similar.",0
"In the memoir written by PERSON1 the author created a mood, that shines throughout the story. The mood represents the hapiness in LOCATION3's life when he lived in a three room apartment Newark, New Jersey. In paragraph two, the author talks about how his parents used their heritage of Cuba and brought it to their new home in the United States. PERSON1 was always greatful how his whole house was revolved around the kitchen. There was always Cuban music and the smell of a Cuban fiest in the air. PERSON1 was always happy because he was always a part of a family. Through out the tough times PERSON1's parents went through there was never a shortage of love or the feeling of family. In paragraph six, the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" When the author says this, it creates a happy mood, and it flows through out the memoir. Also in paragraph seven he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This memoir shows that the importance of family and friends creates a positive feeling in anyone's life.",0
"I think the way how more and more people use computers are bad because, NUM1 int's not good for people's health, NUM2 people who use computers lots of times, refuse to spend time with family and friends and NUM3 you can find more about something that's on a computer by going and studying it yourself. My first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers, is the health issue. Health in very important but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worst. By the way you hunch your back in order to see something small on the computer creen, or when you hold on the mouse, waiting to click onm something for long period of time, can cause arthrities. My second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them. Are that people who are on computers & end to sometimes refuse to spend time with family or friends like for example: CAPS1 say a week ago you made a promise to have a family get together with the family, and they all count on you to come, CAPS2 you get a computers, you go on all these neat websites that you never heard off it's amazing right! WRONG! before you know if, it's the day for the family get together and your line an hour CAPS4 you amke excuse not to come. And that breaks you family's heat....My last reason why, to me computers are a bad idea is you can learn about another the computer by going on to a But its ore fun traveling or meeting people from that place CAPS2 setting in a for and having your neck, back and sore CAPS3 I right, I think I CAPS3. Also idsfun to and ear foods from the culture that you fing cool off that lame computers.(To me that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends!) CAPS4 therefore in conclusion, in my personal opinion computers have bad effects of people health, it can cause later bacj and neck problems maybe even activities. People who use computers a lot or love to spend time on computers refuse to spend time with family and friends, and NUM3 You can find more about something like a culture or land, if you go and study its yourself instead of going on a computers for hours. I hope my opinion convinces others, hoe computers have bad effects on people who use it a lott, and take action into their own hands and do what is right.",0

"People around the world are starting to use computers now more, often, but theirs also people that dont agree that it benefits society, CAPS1 not one of those people. I agree that this benefits society. One reason why I agree is because sometimes theirs teens and even adults that can chat online with their friends if they cant contact them in any other way. Another reason is because in all school teacher give their students project to do over vacation or weekends, for the projects they can look for information in the computer. The last reason is because computers can give ability to learn more about things they didnt know before. In my opinion I agree with computers benefiting society. Teens, kids and even adults would like to talk with their friends so they can get on the computer and chat with them if theirs no other way to contact them, CAPS2 easy. You only have to NUM1) get in the computer, NUM2) get into a site were you know your friend might be NUM3) log in or register in if you never been into that site NUM4) last but not least look NUM4 your friend to chat will teachers always give their students work for example like projects.

Books are books we all read them and summary's over them. To find what we need to know in the past or future or mainly whats going on todays life. So we shouldnt take books off the shelfs just like magizens. They might have information to tell people around the world. Thats why people make books and magizens so people like us can read them while were notbusy in life or just relaxin.      People read bad stuff all the time in books or magizens thats what life is about cause there's some good stuff and there are some bad stuff to read about in life. I mean hey if you dont want your children readin them than have them not read at all. Because more they age the more there going to know whats going on in life. There's stuff thats bad like you cant really stop them. When there at that age in there life so there going to find out some how or another. Cause there are schools that have alot of reading to talk about good stuff that might be important for there future's.Schools are mainly why kids know what they know now because you got all your history  clases. That talk about slavery and every thing els thats bad. When kids say it outta class rooms they get in trouble.      So if they get in trouble outta class then why do would you teach it or even say it. History classes are very helpfull because  they teach you about all the different wars. That has happend and who invaded other countrys or states. They help out on findin places on a maps. That shows all the wolds state and countrys and even where we live in our country.     So really why would u take stuff off the shelfs if other people read them. Mainly why would you do it since other people have worked very hard and there time makin books.  Then have them published for you to just take them off the shelf. What if they wanted to do that to you if you wrote maybe some bad stuff  in a little writing.  Whats the harm in it anyway,0

"Laughter is the key to every friendship I have. If a person is really nice, but I cannot seem to make them laugh, or vice versa, it is hard to find common ground between us. When I see my friendships and reflect on them, it reminds me of all of the great memories over the years and months that were filled with joyous laughter. The simple things that make me happy in life bring about laughter. Whenever differences become clear in friendships, it only takes a memory brought up that made us laugh, to trigger that friendship back into place.  Whenever I'm with my best friend, PERSON1, things that normally would not be funny whatsoever, are. Another element that's put in place is the fact that PERSON1 and I don't hang out as often as we used to, when we went to the same school DATE1 DATE1. So, the absence of eachother makes us treasure our times together even more than usual. Three nights ago, I went to dinner with PERSON1 and her mom at CAPS1 CAPS2. We had numerous amounts of laughing sessions throughout dinner. Everyone who is ever around us, either think we are very annoying because we cannot stop laughing, or understand what it's like to have a best friend that makes your DATE2 brighter, and think we're funny. There has never been a true fight between PERSON1 and I because of how close we've become over the DATE1 and realized how much we are like twins. So conflicts are never really brought up. However, one of my other very close friends, PERSON2, that goes to my previous school with PERSON1, has been having problems with PERSON1. The most important thing to me is that they get along, because they are two of the most important people in my life. I would do anything to make them become friends like they used to be, even though I probably don't have the power to do so. I can get close into both of their hearts and stay on a level of laughter, secrets and wonderful memories. But when they are not getting along with eachother, it's not so easy to bring them together. I had been with PERSON2 TIME1, so I knew what she was feeling as well as PERSON1, who I was with currently. I tried to shortly bring up the subject and at first, she rejected it. I knew that PERSON2 meant a lot to her, and also that they had only gotten in a small arguement over something silly. The issue was that both of them can be very stubborn, and in any type of arguement, neither will say they are sorry first. It's because they both don't believe they have done anything wrong. In this case, it was a small miscommunication. I ended up going into more detail with PERSON1 about how PERSON2 was feeling, because I could completely relate. She later started seeing the other side of things, once I got her laughing. The key to my friendships, is laughter. Especially while we are young. There is no way I could have gotten PERSON1 to listen to my view on PERSON2's feelings unless they were what she wanted to hear. So, I told her what she wanted to hear. Things that made her laugh and giggle. Things that brought back memories of the good times her, PERSON2 and I had had. She thought about it, and even though she wasn't completely ready to full out run up to PERSON2 and hug her over and over, and make peace, she was ready to consider communicating with PERSON2 again. That was enough for me to feel good.   The rest of the TIME2, we put aside the drama and laid back and enjoyed the TIME2. We played our favorite songs and were cracking up the entire TIME2 about the tiniest things, or mistakes we made in our speech when we talked to eachother. I know that as I get older, I will look back on my two best friends, PERSON2 and PERSON1, and realize how they made my high school years so amazing. They brought a better person out of me, someone who can enjoy life to the fullest by being in the right crowd and having innocent fun. They taught me that you can be great friends with more than one person, and even if those two don't get along, you can find a balance and not end up excluding anyone. In the end, the important thing is that you were a good friend to everyone and weren't selfish in the mix. Laughter has brought me to that place. I find that when I'm laughing about sincerely great things, and not making fun of someone or something, I become a lot less selfish and a better friend to people, because my intent is beautiful. I wouldn't get that perspective without true friends that CAPS3 has given me. By the DATE2, PERSON2 calls me and tells me that PERSON1 called her and asked her to talk. Things will change very soon.",0
"In the DATE1's people did not have technology like we had today, they didnt know what they were really even doing. when the architecks were builing The CAPS1 state builing they had many problems. First they couldnt just drop a mast on there because as they said in the story the roof was not flat. Next it said a thousand foot drop would add stress to the frame and last they had to change the frame from steel to glass and they also had to change the roof. All in all men in the DATE1's had a lot of work to do while building the Empire State Building.",0
"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he thinks the definition of ""family"" is. He is very specific in that he believes ""family"" doesn't mean blood relatives, ""family"" is about friends and family coming together to form a community. Where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect. He sets a very specific mood in this memoir which is everyone coming together. That sense of happiness and fullness one might get after doing something good for someone else. Narciso Rodriguez talks about how his dinner table is alway full of family and sometimes friends. That his family's door is always open to people who need help. When you read his memoir, you really understand what ""family"" really is. The feeling of love, open-ness, willingness, and happiness. you get helping other people and being around people you love and who love you. The mood Narciso Rodriguez sets in this memoir is very powerful in that it really makes people stop and think.",0
"i do not believe that computers benefit society, I feel this way because I have heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time doing unproductive things. The main reason why I am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends. The second reason why I am against keeping computers around is because they are too time consuming. Last but not least, I am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising. Now, lets talk about the way people are neglecting their families and friends. Computers are very addicting, so I can understand why people would neglect their loved ones for them, though I can understand why certain individuals do it I dont think its right. I have many friends who would rather be on facebook or myspace than hang out with me. The web site listed above can really make you forget about reality. My friends will forget about interacting with any and everyone just to spend time on the computer all day. The reasons listed above tell you why I believe that computers should be taken away because of neglecting purpose. Now, lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users. i believe that time is a very valuable thing and you should not waste it. So when I read about people wasting time on the computer all day I, myself, was very upset! Statistics show that the average teenager spends NUM1 hours a day on average on the internet, statistics also show that the average aldut spends about NUM2 NUM3 hours on the computer a day on average. When I read the above statistics I came to grips with the fact that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing. Now, lets talk about exercising a bit more. I, myself, know that too much time is being spent on computers. By me knowing that I am aware of the fact that children are not exercising. Exercise is very important for a growing child, and if they are not getting all the exercise that they need it can cause health problems in the future,. Statistics show that around PERCENT1 of children under NUM4 years of age are obese. The above reasons tell you why I believe that exercise is more important than spending time on the computer. Now, lets bring this letter to an end.",0
"The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. It affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has. The rolling hills make him tired and weak along with the rough terrain. The lack of water doesnt help any when hes thirsty because of the hills. The features affect him mentally because the farther he goes the more dalerious he gets. Each more mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just get there Ill be fine. He also blames himself for listening to the old men. And with this also came doubt. He was doubting that he could make it alive. In the story it says, it didnt really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean"". mentally he couldnt make it.",0
"""Laughter"" I believe laughter is the shortest distance between two people. When things between you and a loved one get fuzzy making them laugh will always help break the ice. When I get angry with my boyfriend he knows that in order for me to be happy he must make me smilelaugh. That is exactly what he does. The very first time he made me angry he didn't know what to do. It was DATE1 CAPS1 and I had just started dating. I remember he asked me if I was hungry and I said ""no I'm not hungry,"" so he continued to ask. Since we had only been dating for a short period of time he really didn't know much about me, so he didn't know that I am a type of girl that gets annoyed easily and I have a really low temper. He continued to ask me if I was hungry, thirsty, bored, or tired but he didn't realize that at this point I was really annoyed; an hour and a half passed by and he was still asking! I was going crazy I didn't want to tell him how I felt because I knew I was going to make him feel bad, but I thought to myself and said ""no he has to know because its going to be worst if later on in the relationship he has to find out what I like and don't like on his own rather that me telling him. I went on and told him every single little detail about me good and bad, at first he just listened but towards the end he exploded and told me that why wasn't I just straight up with him from the beginning. That made me really upset, I was trying to be honest with him before anything worse happened but i guess not. I stayed quiet for the longest time and he kept asking me ""what's wrong,"" ""tell me what I did wrong"" so I told him that it really made me upset how he flipped out on me for no reason really all I was trying to do was save us from a larger argument, he looked at me and told me that I did do something wrong! He said that we had already been together for two months and it took me that long to show him my true colors I kind of understood where he was coming from but at the same time I didn't agree because by that point he should have already known. I mean it doesn't take that long to know a person especially if its your girlfriend. In the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other. He busted out saying ""ouch charlie you bit me"" in a CAPS2 accent that just made me loose it I laughed for days after that and completely forgot about thee over whelming discussion we had. The point being here is that laughter is the tool to breaking the ice when things get tough and it doesn't necessarily have to be a loved one it can even be a complete stranger, if the person is shy making them laugh will help construct a great friendship with them. You can make anybody's day go great with just a little grin that you put on their face a simple ""hello"" or ""hey"" can even make them smile. I believe that a person that smiles often lives longer. This MONTH1 not be true but in my little world it is. I am all about smiling, all about making people laugh. Honestly I hate seeing people walk around with angry faces like if they have no friends when all they really want is someone to make them smile-and that would be me! In conclusion, if it wasn't for laughter what relationship would still be standing at this point? None, because if your always arguing and always wining and never laughing then how do you expect your relationship to last? Like I said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""",0
I think the auther concludes the story with the paragraph because it is saying Ill never give up. She is determined to concor everything. I think she is saying she will take the test over and over until she succeeds. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because you should never give up.,0
The author concludes the story with that paragraph to end on a happy yet motivating note. In the story Saeng says that she failed the test and was very dissapointed with herself. The test must have of been very important to her for her to be so dissapointed. The author also probably ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng is devoted in passing this test. Saeng seems like a sentemental yet reliable person. I believe that the test is to spend a minimal amount of money and she wants to earn respect from her mom. That is why taking and passing the test seems so important to Saeng. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.,0
"The mood of the memoir was heart-warming. The way Narciso Rodriguez wrote the memoir was looking back at his life as half full, not as half empty. Instead of pointing out or remembering the bad things about his childhood, he writes about the good parts of his childhood. For example, his parents gave him oppurtunitys despite their struggle. His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of rasism and segregation. Also because of his parents positive attitude, it made him a positive person. Another reason the mood was heart-warming was now Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are. Narciso's parents have given up and done so much for him, resulting in who Narciso Rodriguez is today, makes this memoir truly heart-warming.",0
"Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal views; and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and more wide spread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions.    Let's take LOCATION1 for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a CAPS1 CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do.      When I was in eighth grade, I was CAPS6 ORGANIZATION1 with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an CAPS3 person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant CAPS3 CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements. She yelled CAPS6 us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' CAPS6 first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage.     There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. CAPS6 this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs.     So next time you pick up a book CAPS6 the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad CAPS6 but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it",0

"Narciso Rodriguez CAPS1 the following definition of family in this memoir. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity & friendship. My mother & father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. They showed me with their own lives & these teachings have been the basis of my life. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent & music but life & love. It was here where i learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.",0
"Marcia CAPS1's article ""The Mooring Mast"" explains the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Nobody involved realized the building wouldn't be sturdy enough to allow a thousand-foot dirigible to be docked there. This pressure, and the wind pressure, would be ""transmitted to the building's foundation."" The Steel frame would also need to be reinforced, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Several other problems arose due to pedestrian safety issues: most foreign dirigibles used highly-flammable hydrogen fuel instead of helium. Everyone involved in the project realized that should the hydrogen cause a fire, the many people living in downtown New York could lose there lives CAPS2 the dirigible would be dangling 1,250 feet over crowded CAPS3, endangering countless pedestrians. CAPS2 there was a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Although the Empire State Building never got to fulfill it's purpose, it is an international landmark in the heart of New York.",0
"Computers, one of the daily things we use and CAPS1 with. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on the awesomeness of the computers! I love computers but, I as a teen know about managing your time on the computer. You cannot sit there and waste your time on the computer. The amount of time wasted on your computer could be the time you might be outside haveing fun. Theres lots of things you could do outside! As for some exsamples: CAPS1 come ball, run around, go to the park, go exploring etc... Friends and family are very entertaining, I have lots of friends and I love them all! If you have some spare time you should hang out with them and have some fun, go to the mall! I always go to the mall with my friends insted of playing on the computer for hours on end.

"NUM1, NUM2, NUM3, NUM4, NUM5, NUM6, NUM7, NUM8! my poms coach PERSON1 says as we practice the dance over and over again. I love poms but at times it gets very tiring. We have practice DATE1, and DATE3. We also have six girls including me. My coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves .On our first game we had practice right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were so excited we all just wanted to go and perform all day. But the game was at NUM5:45 pm and they didnt even start until NUM6:00 pm which was way later than expected. So all my poms team, our coach, and all of our family had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over NUM11 until we actually, finally got to perform. Finally it was the DATE2 and the clock bit three, which ment we all went on the track to stretch .We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didnt get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Getting in our formation the clock quickley started to drop from fifty seconds to NUM12 then quickely we only had NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldnt believe it, only NUM13 seconds until our very first performance. The thrill rushed through my head as the man announced CAPS1 performing CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4 pom pon team then our names over the speakers. The crowed roared as we entered the field. We quickley all reminded our self to smile. Then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out honoring and thanking our coach and our parents. After we finished we were automatically huttled around by friends and family. And waiting and being patient wasnt so bad anymore.  It was all worth the wait.",0
"RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here!  It took lots of my patience  to stay quiet and not scream to the world. I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot. On DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth graders. We were all divided into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our  three day stay at  ORGANIZATION1.  I was so excited my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrased  CAPS4 I didnt care.  I finally snapped to it and kept my cool.  In CAPS1 and CAPS2 I was stuck ahead how to make my ??? of ORGANIZATION1 & friend  in my group named PERSON1  told me some ideas, CAPS4 I wanted to have her CAPS4 ???

I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response  was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being a idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most.",0
"Laughter is a natural reaction every human being has when they are either happy or have heard or seen something that is funny to them. It is healthy to be happy other than sad or mad. Laughter is pretty much a sign of happiness, as crying is of sadness. It is just another natural emotion any person is born with. I agree to the quote someone once said about laughter being the closest distance between two people because, if two people get along, they will have many moments in life together where they are happy. It is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor as for they won't take everything personally and can understand a joke. Its always good to have a sense of humor because its something everyone appreciates, also, that way people can see that you like to have fun when you know you don't have to be serious. When your with a group of friends that you get along with very well, one of the main things you will hear is laughter. It shows that you get along and that your having a good time.  Of course there are times when its better not to laugh, or when people laugh for no reason, which often gets annoying. Yes laughing means your happy, but when its not needed and is used just to cause noise, it is better to be quiet than annoy everyone around you. In my group of friends we are always laughing and joking around with each other, i like when people have a good sense of humor, i feel more relaxed and its easier to talk to them. Unless, that is, they take everything as a joke and never take anything seriously. Even though it is natural, you have to know when you can and cant laugh. Its a way to show happiness, but in certain situations, it can be disrespectful or rude.  Sometimes when I'm with my friends, they MONTH1 joke around about a certain person, and once it happened like this;at my friends birthday party, we all went to a bowling alley and as always, were all standing around talking and having a good time. While we were talking, PERSON3 and PERSON4 were joking around about something so we all started listening to their conversation. They were joking around about something and then PERSON3 said something as to turn him down in some way, ask a joke, and PERSON4 said that hes going to get his heart broken. Right after that was said, ORGANIZATION1 pitched in, adding again. So it turned out to sound like PERSON4 was going to have his heart broken again. As everyone laughed at it, PERSON4 looked at ORGANIZATION1 with a hurt expression and was the only one not laughing. You see, PERSON4 had a girlfriend that broke up with him about two months ago, ORGANIZATION1 forgot about that and didn't mean anything when she added ""again"". She meant it as a joke but it turned out to sound very mean. In this case, the laughter caused by ORGANIZATION1 was meant for PERSON4, who was hurt by ORGANIZATION1's comment. Good thing ORGANIZATION1 noticed and remembered about PERSON4's ex later that day. She ended up apologizing for saying something she should have thought through more carefully before saying.  How a person takes it when people laugh at them, has a lot to do with friendship. One time, my friends were driving to a party, or home from a party and were listening to music in the car, one of the guys in the car was singing his heard out to a song by PERSON1. At one point, while he was singing, his best friend suddenly turned down the volume so everyone in the car heard PERSON2 sing really loud, with no music. Everyone started laughing because PERSON2 didn't know that CAPS1 would turn off the music in the middle of something. Even though it was kind of embarrassing, PERSON2 laughed along because it was pretty funny. If PERSON2 and CAPS1 weren't such good friends, i think for sure PERSON2 would have gotten mad at CAPS1 for doing such a thing to him while there where other people in the car aside from just them two. Friends understand each others sense of humor, and know when doing something is going to far, or when the other person will think it's funny too and will laugh along. So as you see, laughter can be happy, thankful, annoying, and or mean, you just have to know when it's okay to do, and when it is better not to laugh. Even though it's a natural reaction, it is one that can be controlled and thought about before doing. Next time someone says something that's funny, first think about if it can be insulting to someone before laughing at it and hurting someone. Otherwise, enjoy life and be happy.",0
"The mood Created by the CAPS2 in the memoir was happy. First thing CAPS1 the mood is happy Of this memoir is when the CAPS2 wrote ""Passionate Cuban music (which I dore to this day)"" that meant that CAPS3 really love her Culture music.

"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced were nature, safety and the law. Al Smith, CAPS1 of New York and headed construction of the Empire State Building, was determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles.In building the mooring mast, came obstacles. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to keep from swaying, but if used here, lead weights would be dangling NUM1 ft above pedestrians heads. Which leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable, if ignited, the possibly largest accident would occur to New York City. The Final obstacle is the law. There is a law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas."" Which would make the mooring mast's purpose illegal. Today, it is nothing more but decoration.",0

"Computers are becoming a household item in the LOCATION1 and around the world. There is a problem through, because some people believe that computers don't benefit society. In my opinion, computers are a CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a CAPS9 resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. The world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. Post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! IM's, CAPS1 CAPS2, use one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like CAPS3 and CAPS4, which allow you to update your ""status"" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the ""call"" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like ORGANIZATION1 apps, CAPS5, and document folders. ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is CAPS9 for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say ""organization is the key to success"", so CAPS5 definetly helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized. All you have to do is name it, click save, and bada bing bada boom you're done! Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information. Books will take a few days and you only have NUM1 days to research, create, and organize your project and data. What are you gonna do now? You could hand it in late, but then you'll yet in trouble. Here is where the fast and reliable internet comes in if you need to know the difference between PERSON2 and PERSON1, use the search engine ORGANIZATION2. If you have a question about the CAPS7 CAPS8, use LOCATION2. Anything at all that you MONTH1 need is at the tips of your fingers, with a little help from your computer and internet of course. In conclusion, I would like to state that computers aren't a good thing for society, they are a CAPS9 thing for civilization! From communicating with friends and family around the world to organizing our everyday lives and helping us research important topics, the internet and computers are a CAPS9 way to help out our lives in my opinion. Wouldn't you agree with me?",0
The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life. The test might be one to see if she can understand her self. There changes in the weather all the time there changes in the spring fall she other that you just got to get over.,0
"If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves? Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes. Others might not think anything of the item and move along. I disagree with those who believe the item should be remove. Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves.      As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book. I steared clear of the 'grown-up' area. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive.      However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. Shehe has the right to remove that item but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, CAPS1 programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one persons interests.      This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries. If there is an offensive book or a bad CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.      If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their CAPS4 there if they find out someone keeps removing their work. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down.      I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect. I believe that the book or magazine or CAPS2 should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened. This is why I feel books should stay where there are",0
"Emotions,symbolizim, to it realized  all are reasons the author concluded the story that way. a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you, with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope, and wounder. The author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses. In the final story the author leaves a lot of peceptions on several. Like the importance of the plant and why did they move from a place that they lavd so much. That is why I think the author ended the story that way.",0
"The first obstacle is being able to get the passengers on and off due to the height they are already at. Also as stated in paragraph NUM1 ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" CAPS1 therefore the power of the wind is a huge obstacle. Another obstacle stated in paragraph NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area."" CAPS1 the law was another obstacle they had to face.",0
A time I was patient was when I really wanted a game called x-men CAPS3 wolver in and my mom said I had to what until CAPS1 came strolling down the road. I can understand why she said that because we were a lttle shorf on cash at that time so we had to make the rest of what we had last a little longer. After a few week had past I forgot all about the game then on CAPS1 day my sister and I got down stairs so fast then when we were oozning gifts I noticed a gift with my name on it. I go grab it and I opened it and it was it x-men CAPS3 CAPS4 and tow other games that I wanted offer that I go up to my room grab my CAPS5 and headphones pop in x-me CAPS3 and played it all day long,0

"CAPS1 opinion on the fact of the computer is that it can be bad for the citizens in LOCATION2 in LOCATION1. I think that some people are not getting enough exercise and I also think that you can get lazy on the computer is bad too. CAPS1 three reasons for CAPS1 opinion is NUM1. People are not getting enough exercise, NUM2. People get lazy and changes while being on the computer an mount of time, NUM3. They will get addicted to the computer. The first reason is because people are not getting enough exercise I pick that reason because people I know gain a lot of weight and it's kinda of sad because they do nothing but stay on the computer and eat. Another detail is that the computer messes up your eyes by staring at that type of screen. One time I did that and CAPS1 eyes felt weird after getting on the computer. The third detail was that people gets very fragile and weak. I picked that detail because if you get up off the computer and exercise your bones will become weak. The second reason is because people will become lazy and changes for an example people will keep asking you to get stuff and do stuff for them and you would do it because you be a good friend. The second detail is that the person will change, the person will be lazy to go to fun events with you as a freind. The next thing you you wont have a freind anymore. The third detail is that it's like your bestfriend has replaced you for a computer that hurts if a person you know for a long time has replaced you for a computer thats something that will make you depressed and make you wanna commit suicide too me anyways. The third reason is because the person will get addicted to the computer for an example you want to celebrate a birthday and the person says ""first I got to beat this level."" CAPS2 the person saying that the person is not going to get off the computer. Another detail is that his day will go pass fast and thats like waisting days of life and people who died will do anything to get their life and to waist is not good. The third detail is you will began to hate the person because the person dosen't care about anything but the computer. Those were the reasons to explain CAPS1 opinion on the compter fact in the news paper I read.",0
"I do believe that certain materials such as books, movies,magazines ,etc should be removed from the shelfs if they are found offensive.  I think offensive books movies music and etc should be removed from shelfs becasue that is basically encouraging young children that if they see something innoproperiate its okay to watch . I would not want my brother or sister to watch, or see anything thing that is not approperiate.  I remember there was a time I was thirteen years old and my mom and step dad at the time did not agree that I should have PERSON1,CAPS1 or NUM1 on my television, They thought that I was too young to be watching what was on CAPS2 and it was innoproperiate in their opinion. I disagreed with that, I thought I should have the right to have watch it because I liked the shows and they were interesting to watch. Everything that was on CAPS2 was not as bad in my opinion. When I would watch music videos on CAPS1 every song that was being played was the edited version. I had to argue and prove a point in why I should have NUM2, NUM1 on my CAPS2.   Parents all have a different opinion in what is good and what is bad for their children. In my case my mom did not want me to watch anything that was bad. She knew what it was like when she was young. She thought that maybe i would think what i see on CAPS2 is not a bad thing . I was thinking to myself that oh well i am young and i will eventually learn in the long run from what is good and what is bad",0
"How safe is it to have a large dirigible CAPS1 above thousands of civilians? The builders had many problems to face will attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. For one thing the mast was not yet even said to be ready in this excerpt ""to fix a mast at such a height made it desireable to postponed to a later date."" The landing gear was also not yet ready or sure to work. The idea of using dirigibles over such a crowded area was not even said to be relevantly smart.",0
"CAPS2 people in our community use computers for positive ideas. Such as if gives you hadn and eye coordination, gives people the ability to research on far away places and allows you to talk to far away family. This is why I think computers have a positive effect on people. To begin with computers give a positive efect on people because it gives you hand and eye cordination. For example that can help you to have ability to do more. Like work somewhere such as a restraunt. This needs lots of cordination for holding heavy trays. My mom is a waitress and she needs a lot of cordination she tells me. Another reason would be you would have more hand cordination driving because you can react fast. Some people say that computers make you not be able to see while. Which than you would need glasses. But thats there desision this can give you one reason that computers are a positive effect on people today. Secondly why computers are a positive effect because it gives people the ability to search far away places. Why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what its like and might want to take a trip there. Another reason would be that students usually have projects which call for research in other countries. Computers make kids smarter that way but some people say that kids could get on a website where it can be bad, which also they arn't getting exersize if all there doing is researching when they can do that in the own town. But about PERCENT1 of kids can stil be on the computer than go and get exersize. This is another reason computers are an impact. Lastly, why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker. For exmaple if a family member lives far away instead of mail you can send it on the computer in a NUM1 minute send. Its quicker and easier. Another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as well. About PERCENT2 of kids use computers to talk to there friends But some people say kids can think there talking to there friends but could be someone bad. But to make sure all your friends should have one question to make sure its there friend. This is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults, and children, parents. To conclude, I would like to say that computers are a positive impact for a couple reasons one it gives you more hand and eye coordination gives people the ability to search other countries and beable to talk to friends. Others disagree because it can ruin your eyes, not get exersize and lastly give your child unsafe. But that can be changed easily by limiting kids, see who they talk to and get them in a sport. This is why I think computers are a postive impact.",0
I think the author concludes this in the story because when they come back is when the character feels she would be prepare to take that test again.,0
"As I remember back, it was DATE1. It was a hot, humid day. I can remember that day like it was yesterday. I woke up that morning and decided I was going to go swimming. But the only problem was I had no one to go with me, and CAPS2 attitude was turning for the worst. The day CAPS1 off fairly well for the most part. I called around to all CAPS2 friends to see what they were doing for that particular day, but as I went down CAPS2 friend line everyone seemed to be to busy to go anywhere with me. I was most certainly bummed. CAPS2 happy go lucky attitude turned into the dumps really fast. The only thing that was left for me to do was use CAPS2 back up plan, CAPS2 aunt. We gathered our swimming gear, blankets, tanning lotion, and ourselves and packed it in the back of the van and headed towards ORGANIZATION1. I was really not in the best of moods, and it seemed that everyone that was around me was turning into a grump as well. Totally bummed that all of CAPS2 friends had ditched me and left me to hang with CAPS2 aunt all day wasn't CAPS2 explanation of fun, sorry enough to say, but it wasn't.  As the day went on the more I thought about CAPS2 friends the more I got frustrated. Then finally it came to me, why let their stupidity of ditching (the best thing that had happened to them) me, ruin CAPS2 day. I CAPS1 laughing and having a grand time, and pretty soon, in all reality forgot why was having a bad day. When we got to our swimming hole, I looked around and noticed that everything was well. Everyone there was having fun. So I CAPS1 to loosen up and have a good time. Jumping off rocks, making a fool of myself, laughing, and having a good time. We spent the whole day enjoying with what we had.  When I got home and I had realized what an awesome day CAPS2 day had turned out to be, I realized that I shouldn't let CAPS2 friends get me down. Laughing and having a good time can make any day turn around for the best. The most important lesson that I have learned from CAPS2 experience that day, is to make the best out of each situation. Don't let crushed plans crush your self confidence. Put a smile on your face and turn your frown upside down and laugh. laughter makes life better.",0
"Book CAPS1          CAPS2 my name is CAPS3 and I dont think CAPS4 book's,magizines and etc. should be taken off the shelf because. Book's help people read and concentrate. In my case the more book's the better and these book's have been here to keep us occiupied. Without them we would have no bref discripson or what happened in the past. Book's have alway's been here to support us and every story must have some fun detail. Without book's I don't know what we would be doing without them.                                                                                                            Book's have been the greatest thing in my life and CAPS5 hurts for us to know that you wan't to get rid of them after, you made us read them when we where kid's so what is the point of getting rid of them when we got this far. In magizine's there's lot's to know about our people and how we live. We have gotten this far to go to the top. At least when we do read we know how to do some certain things For instance, do you remember when you were a kid and you alway's hated reading but now, a whole new change went into your life and you now know what to do. My fravorite book I have ever read was the CAPS6 and CAPS5 was inapporite but CAPS5 also had meanning. We have to keep these stories alive and im not going to let you take the thing we love to do away.               I love book,s and I hate to see them go away. these book,s were here when we were kid's and we have to keep the lagacy up. Reading is the best thing in life and CAPS5 helps clear our mind's. Thanks to reading I was able to explain to you this much and how supportive I am with these book's. CAPS5 would devestate our country,states,cities,school's and reading clubs so please don't remove our book's thats all we ask and not only will you make me happy but you'll make our reader's very happy. Thank you for reading this and have a nice day",0
"Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes paitents can be fast or be slow. CAPS2 can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in CAPS1 in experiments  CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patients so CAPS2 is right not having patients CAPS2 will be wrong. That is what patients means to me and everyone has to use CAPS2 and CAPS2 is part of your daily life.",0
"Once on DATE1 break my family and I went to LOCATION1. While we were at LOCATION1 we went to a huge water park. My two sisters and I convinced my parents to go there. A few days later we went to the water park. We rented a locker, changed our clothing, and started looking for waterslides. Right as we walked in there was a huge (take) sunken ship. On the very to where zip- lines! We all ran to the ship and realized that there was a line. Not a short line. A giant line. We must have been there NUM1 minutes waiting. Eventually it came my turn. I grabbed the handle and kicked off the ground. I had almost reached the end when it slowed to a stop. I let go falling into a pool. The wait was totally worth it!",0
"Do you use a computer? Is there one at your house? Well, the average household owns two computers, but this isn't good, CAPS2 computers are taking valuable time away from hobbies, nature, and real-life. First, computers take time away from hobbies and friends. Some of my friends spend NUM1 hours on the computer a day that they could be playing. a sport or hanging out. Also, the computers become the center of their lives. People ask me "" CAPS1 weren't you online TIME1?"" and i answer ""CAPS2 i have a life that doesn't revolve around CAPS3."" CAPS4, the computer takes time away from nature. People dont acknowledge the beauty of the outdoor. Now that our lives are so orderly, we need the wilderness even more than CAPS2 it helps us to appreciate ourselves more and appreciate how special our planet computer take all that away! Third, computers take us away from real-life. Some people dont know how to have a face-to-face conversation, they only know how to communicate by email or CAPS5. I acknoowledge that getting away from real life can be relaxing but some people dont know which side the stomp goes on a letter. It MONTH1 old-fashioned, but i believe people put their heart something you can't do by email. In conclusion, computers take time away from real-life, nature and your hobbies. Plus, you can get arthritis in your hands if you type to much.",0
The obstacles faced by the Empire State building builders were. one was the existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Stated in CAPS1 NUM1. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. With the dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a cable tether would have put stress on the building therefore they would have had to make the structure of the building stronger,0
The author of this memoir presented a kind of grateful and cheerful mood. I believe it is this type of mood because in the memoir he talks so much about on how that he is so grateful that his parents were so caring and selfless people because they moved from their home country cuba just for the sake of their children. He presents the cheerful mood by focusing all the good things in his life with his parents in his house and neighborhood. Example's are him talking about how all the cultures got along good with one another in his area. He also talked about the good times he had with his parents in the kitchen. The memoir he left was definetly a pausitive one not a negative one.,0
"I believe the author concluded the story with When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. because it shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair."" The hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memorys. The hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better.",0
"The author of this memoir created many moods. One mood that was felt is happiness because of the way Narciso Rodriguez described his home to be a place of childhood innocence, family, friends, and endless celebrations. Another mood is gratitude for I have never given up my friends, family, and home and Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to give up their friends, family, and home in Cuba to support Narciso. The last mood is admiration at the fact the Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the PERSON2, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made the readers feel many moods while telling his insperational story.",0
A time when I was patient was when I was at the doctors office. I was waiting for my doctor to come out. But he was taking a really long time to come out and I was ??? to be patient so hard to stay caled andy then the doctor came out and I started to feel  better.,0
"Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has NUM1 older sister, named LOCATION1. LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesnt understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesnt get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you.",0
"The mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratefulness.     One way the mood is gratefulness is how much Narciso likes his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful of his culture.       Another way is how much family he has that aren't really family. ""Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira... My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also... regularly joined our table."" This shows that he is grateful for all the extended family members he has.      Lastly would be how his parents cared for him. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" This shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are.",0
To me patience means that you are ready to wait a long time to do something. I was somewhat patient when I was delayed at a airport then canceld it was not very fun because I didnt eat all afternoon. But I was happy because I had my ds. The story was we went to LOCATION1 on the NUM1 for vacation to disney land. It was snowing when we reached the airport. We had to hurry through the check line and the security. When we got to the boarding gat we looked for where we had to board. I saw that our flight was delayed that ment we had to stay here in the airport. I aleast saw that we were going to new LOCATION2 first then to LOCATION1 but I stayed patient. Well thats the day I stayed very very patient.,0
"The author set the mood in different ways Such as describing where he lived before he moved then when he told about his culture and him inheriting it then how he moved to LOCATION1. He does not set the mood when he talks about his parents being selfish. The biggest part of the mood is talking about where he lived at first, where and what he had. He might have a good start with mood if he told more about the kind of education he got whether he was in Cuba or LOCATION1. The mood was an overall ok because more about his life but the memoir was not a complete success. But as long as he had a satisfied, happy, organized life it was a good tone of mood.",0
The mood was happy beacuse most of his family immigrated to LOCATION1. That him and his parents loved to cook. He loved the smell of the kitchen There family sometimes cooks and to visit them and eat. The auther past was unhappy because they needed to put up with racism.,0
"Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before .Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better.",0
"The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. The problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking.Firstly, the main problem was the location. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public.Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. The purpose of the Empire State Building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed.",0
"Some people might think that it is a good idea to censor things on library. People might think that some of the material might be offensive of bad for the youth of the people who go to libraries.People might think it MONTH1 be better to take the bad and offensive item off the shelf. I have a different opion on the subject. I don't think anything should be censored in the library no matter if it deal with book, movies, music, magazines, ect.,     The real question is why should this material be censored removed. The answer to that question is that it should not be sensored  removed. The library is somewhere you can go to get information on just about anything you want. If these items are censored or taken off the shelfs the resources would be limited and or no help to the people searching for the information. Another big problem with censoring or removint these materials is people might be missing out on alot of knowleged that they have never herd of that might be bad or offensive. Such as slavery, the CAPS1 taking over the CAPS2, and a lot of our world history. I feel strongly about people knowing about the worlds past.     Now what happens if the items are removed from the shelfs of libraries. what are you going to do with the thousands of books that you can no longer read because it is offensive. We just can't get rid of them just like that. A lot of the offensive stuff is true or based on a true story such as ORGANIZATION1 park getting arrested because she refused to give up a seat to a white person. so removing these books would be pointless because where ever you put them people will just go there to get the material they want to know about.      The most important thing about this is who want these books censored or gone and why they want to remove them. Okay some book are bad and offensive but you have to look at it this way. People have there own choice on what they want to read , watch,or listen to. So just because some people dont like the material in a library doesn't mean everyone else doesn't like it. It the peoples choice not a opion on what a couple people say.     So at the end i think that books and other items in a library sould not be censored or taken off the shelfs. I believe that people have the right to read, listen, or watch what ever they want. I see it as people opions fighting opions on removing the books. Also if people don't like the book at the library then no one told them thay have to go meaning their opion really doesn't matter",0
"I believe that there is nothing wrong with being on the computer. The computer in my thought helps you learn about new technology stuff such as new games to help you learn or new websites. Also using computer helps you talk to people you know that maybe you haven't talk to in a while and you don't know their number. I think that having a computer makes you smart because i mean you still do other stuff besides be on the computer all day, when you are not on you are either hanging out with friendsfamily or you are eating or sleepingworking out or just doing something like homework. I believe using a computer is part of you healthy choices and you can lean a lot more than you really think you can. Using a computer and learning in school basically can teach you the same thing. I computer can be very health for you hands because when you are consteatly moving you hands gives them more strength and can give you stronger muscles in your hands and lower arms. Inconclusion, I believe that computers are health for you don't take anytime away from exercising time or time with friendsfamilysportssleep or eating. Computers are a hundred percent health for you. So i think that people should keep using their computers but just make sure they fit everything else into it each day.",0
"Computers are one of the world's best discoveries today. For one, they help in our educational processes. They also help connect people from all over the world in little time and are a neccesity in science research. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new computers they strive to meet every goal. Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can, underneath that hard drive is a wealth of knowledge awaiting to be saked up by eager minds. Also, in todays world, waiting is almost non-existant. Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better unless you want to risk tommorow's future workforce, computers are in essential tool for us, and our children. One of the best things a lot this world is that we're all different, connecting with each other helps us learn how to tell with each other and move forward as a society. Conneticing through the internet through programs like ORGANIZATION1 is important for buissnesses as it helps them make decisions faster will ultimatly effect us. But don't be fooled. It can also befor pleasure, say CAPS3'son & buissness trip in LOCATION1. No problem. Just go on webcam with him and you don't have to miss him anymore. In the government, problems evolve quickly, and steathily. To solve this, a president can quickly connect to hisher advisors while still being in hisher office. Connecting people through computers is maraculous, and important to life as we know it. In addition, we wouldn't be were we are in science if it wasn't for computers. First of all, we are making great strides with cancer research to day, than estatic common computer. If it wasn't for that, we might not even have kemotherapy. Lets face it, computers are faster then us; way faster. But this is a god thing, because faster proccesing means faster research. While a simple machine MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its proccesing speed. It certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases shold beneath. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist can not know everything. But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world, they can analize research, and make very informed, responsible decisions. Certainly that will extend our life exsentency, and who doesn't want you've larger's some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens. But bear in mind, these are the people helping you stay alive, and helping lower your heathcare bill yoour talking about. So when you get ill and they find a cure, why don't you still compain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors! Trust them, they know what they are doing. So can we come to an agreement life? Computers only do good things, like enhance our youth's advention, connect our and help us find cures for the most malignant diseases and illnesses in the world. So help the world help you, and go promote the use of computers across your community. It will only further advance us as a society in the end.",0
"STATE1 NUM1, PERSON1, IN CAPS1 Katherine Paterson,                                            I read your article in newspaper yesterday about offensive books in library. I agree with you on this article. Some of the books, music, movies, or magazines in public libraries are very offensive to me but they can be normal to other people.There can also be somw books that are normal to me and can be offensive to other people. Everyone have their own views and ideas on everything.The people of LOCATION1 have freedom of speech so it is true that every mouth has got something differrent to say.                       There are some books or movies that children can not read or watch but children still do because once the child is in library he can read,watch, or listen to anything. You can not depend on librarian because there are other people in the library too.The librarian probably have other things to do like arranging the books or checking out the books or making library card or helping someone find a book.                       In my point of view, library should have diferent sections for different kinds of movies,books, or magazines and there should be person assigned for every section. This way children would not be able to go to older people's section. If there are books that are found offensive by everyone, then people should write a letter to president to help remove those books from library.Yours NUM2.",0

She will wait for the winter to pass so that she can pass the test. The coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth.

"Computers are the way of the future. I believe that computers benefit society. I believe this because computers enable you to talk to family and friends online. It also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from. Lastly it teached hand-eye coordination. First computers alow you to socialize online. I know CAPS1 I get home from school I can talk to virtually any friends online. People against computers say it takes away time from interacting with family, however, this is not true. I talk to all of my aunts via facebook and other social websites. Also CAPS1 my parents are at work the are abile to message me over the computer with out having to go get a phone and call my house. My last reason for this is that it helps me and my friends get intouch easier lets say I'm having a friend come over, but he got sick. He woulden't have to go look up a number and call me, he could just send me a message of the internet. My second reason is that computers help with education. I know that CAPS1 I'm stuck on a problem at home, I'll just go on the computer and look up the answer. Also, CAPS1 I have to do projects, the computer is very helpful for me and many other kids, CAPS1 doing a project, I can't getall of my information from one book so I go on the computer and look up information about the subject. This really improves students grades, because they had more resources and more information to choose from, instead of only the information in the book. My last reason is that using a computer can help with hand-eye coordination. On the computer there are many sites that have very interactive sites the you can really benefit from I know of one website that was able to help me with my fielding in baseball because it had interactive games that would actually help with things is real life, like fielding in baseball. I know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball. So the computer actually helped with real life activities. To sum it all up I think computers can benefit society a lot. Like being able to communicate with your friends. Also being able to look up school work with. Lastly helping with hand-eye coordination.",0
"The mood in this memoir was very happy and grateful to be living in the house where Narciso had such good neighbors as family, who were close to him.

"The mood created by the author in the memoir is being grateful. First, the author reveals her greatfulness by complimenting her mother and father. She states, ""my mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (NUM1). The author is grateful because her parents came to LOCATION1. But she is grateful because they didn't come for themselves, they came for her. They gave up everything they had for her. Next, all her thanking shows her being grateful. The author tells he parents of her ""admiration for their strength and perseverance"" (NUM2) and has ""thanked them repeatedly"" (NUM2). The author reveals gratefulness through what she tells her parents. She is grateful for their perseverance and for their strength through this whole process and thanks them over and over again. Finally, she is grateful when they are leaving their house. She reveals, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (NUM4). The author is being grateful here when she recognizes the house she has lived in, the house her parents have worked so hard to get to. And now, he is grateful that they have enough money to have a bigger home. The mood created by the author in the memoir is being grateful.",0
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason the features of the setting affect him is because it is hot outside which makes him need more water. An example of this is I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. CAPS1 example of being hot outside is A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.",0
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting dirigibles to dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians.",0
"I think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected. If you move to another town, go to a colledge far away, or move because of a job you will most likely, if CAPS5 is further away, loose connection with you friends. But, using a computer can solve that problem. In social networking sites like CAPS3, twitter and myspace you can simpily look up your distant friends from  you previoulsy lived and have contact with them. Youi can catch up with each other, recall good times you've had, end maybe make plans to meet each other sometime. PERCENT1 of CAPS2 have been reconnected using social networking site on a computer. Experts also say that CAPS5 is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier. I have had an experience when a scoial networking site has reconnected me with a CAPS2. When i was younger I had a CAPS2 whos grandmother lived  to CAPS1 dad. After a little over a year of  him being good friends be moves to LOCATION1, I thought I would never hear from him again. Later that year I also moved to a different town, CAPS1 CAPS2 searched me on CAPS3 and we got connected again, I have found out he moved back to where I use to live. That is the first reason I think that computers are CAPS4 good for people. The second reason, CAPS5 is that computers can be great knowledge scources for people. If you ever need to set information   that not have to  through the  of book,then, a computer is the thing for you. As long as you than  to find an accurate and reliable scourse than a computer. Is an amazing tool. You can look up almost anything and you will be able to find locks of information on CAPS5. Statistics show that you can find PERCENT2 more information on a computer than a book. Experts have stated that soon books will be obsolite and computer will rain  as knowledge scources. That is the second reason why I think computers are good for people. Last of all, I think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills. What I  by programs is yes of course videogames. Almost all of the computer games out have multiplayer features. Withins the multiplayer universe there are match types that involve a great amount of teamwork. In the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win. And that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork. That is CAPS1 third reason why I think computers are good for people. In conclusion, I think that computers are good for people, they help to reconnect friends, , knowledge, and build teambuilding skills with programs that are out for CAPS5.",0
One time when I was patient was when a new video game was coming  out. I asked my dad CAPS1 we could pre-order it but he said no and that I would have to wait until CAPS2. So I waited until CAPS2 and I still didn't get the game. So I didn't say anything about the game. It was then my birthday and I opened my last gift it was the video game! I was so excited I gave my parents CAPS4 and & me my brother went to play it.,0
"Censorship for books? Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we?      Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.      It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permenantly be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics.For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of CAPS1 cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest. It was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine?      On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessable to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand, as well.      The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even CAPS2's have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book.",0
"In the essay Rough Road ahead by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had many changes due to the setting of what was around. The cyclist was lost in the dessert. This affected him a lot because the desert is very hot. He could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion. Also, in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the cyclist journey, he saw a poisonous snake. It was a good thing that he was cautious around the snake because if he wouldnt have been, he might have gotten bitten and there would be no one around to help him. The desert that he was in. also happened to be desserted and there was no one around to help him with the directions. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water.

"Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however; some that I have read MONTH1 not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea.      People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea.      As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that MONTH1 be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me.      For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interrested in. So lets keep everyone in mind, and their different interrests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library",0

""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" CAPS1, Narciso uses parentheses to give more background information.Narciso's memoir was a very heart felt story.

"Laughing is one of the key components in all my relationships with others. It lightens the mood of any situation and can really lift my sprits when I'm having a bad day. It is often the ice breaker when I meet someone new and can help me get closer to the friends I already have.  On the first day of school, freshman year, I met a girl named LOCATION1. We were in writing class and there was a boy named CAPS1 sitting between us. CAPS1 and I were talking about our schedules, and he said something that made our conversation slightly uncomforatable. I looked up and saw that LOCATION1 had heard what he had said and had a look on her face that was somewhere between being embarrassed for me and close to laughing. I smiled at her and mouthed the word ""awkward"" when CAPS1 turned away. This was her cue that it was okay to laugh, and she did so subtly. I didn't know that this first laugh would lead to many more in a friendship that would develop almost instantly. After the first week of schedules being changed and students being shuffled around, we found out that we had every single one of our classes together, except CAPS3. We probably spent more time laughing in those classes than getting work done, and I'm not exactly sure how we managed to pass all our classes. Spending so much time together, it was only a matter of time before we had enough inside jokes to fill up a dictionary. Nearly any word or just the sight of something related to one of our jokes can send us into a fit of laughter. Sometimes, we don't have to say anything at all. I'll just look at her, and we'll burst out laughing. Because of this, our friends often question our sanity. When we start laughing, they'll look at eachother, and then at us for a clue as to why, or ask if we are okay. They don't understand us the way we understand eachother. People always get our names mixed up even though we look nothing alike. Our names dont even rhyme, or start with the same letter. But I can't really blame them. We're so much alike! From the activities we participate in to the way we think, we could almost be the same person. She makes me laugh every single day, and she's one of my best friends. CAPS4 is another one of my friends who is constantly making me crack up. Whenever I'm with her, I'm always terrified of peeing in my pants. She's not as close to me as LOCATION1 is, but we've gotten to be such better friends this year. We have a lot of classes together this year, and that's probably why we've gotten closer. We're always doing stupid stuff together, and laughing about it the whole time. For example, she and I like to laugh obnoxiously loud and exaggerate our ""ha's"" when someone tells a really lame or cheesy joke. Our biotech teacher loves to tell cheesy jokes, so when we're in his class, we sit together anticipating one of his jokes so that we can laugh. We also like to chew our gum with our mouths open, in order to make the chewing noise louder. I often laugh so hard that I can't even chew. I know I'll have a good day if I'm with CAPS4. She can make me laugh in a way a lot of my other friends can't. It comes deep from within, to the point where you can't even breathe, and tears and running down your face. It makes your entire face is sore, even your eyes, from being scrunched up for so long. She's such a fun person to be around, and I'm glad to have her as one of my friends. Laughing is a very important part in the relationships I have with other people. If my friends couldn't make me laugh, our friendship would be so much more boring. Nothing would be fun. If I never laughed, I'd never be happy, and that's not a life I'm willing to try. Life is hard. It's not easy, and it's not always going to be smiles and smooth sailing. There's going to be sadness and rough waters. But no matter how tough this life MONTH1 get, I know I'll have friends like LOCATION1 and CAPS4 there to share a laugh.",0

Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.

"What is offensive in libraries?  The offenses in libraries are inappropriate and non-censored books, music, magazines, movies, and other materials in libraries.  These books and other things in these libraries should not be removed from the shelves.  They should not be removed because the authors of the books are just writting.     From my own experience, I have seen innapropriate movies.  To me, I feel that they teach me some lessons, but, it also depends on what type of movie it is.  If it is rated CAPS1 then I know that I MONTH1 see some blood, gory scenes, and nudity.  If this type of movie is not CAPS2 CAPS3, then I know that some of this stuff on the screen MONTH1 happen in real life.  Most MONTH1 not happen, but there is a good chance that some of it will happen to someone in the world.  All of this teaches me to be more careful about what I am doing and where I am doing it at.     In libraries, there should not be nudity websites, books, or magazines or anything like that because that is just stupid and innapropriate for any child to see, especially in a public library.  Now if a gory or a book with lots of blood in it, then it should stay on the shelves.  I say it honestly shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same thing.     So, as I ask again, what MONTH1 be offensive in libraries?  Some MONTH1 say that books, magazines, movies etc. with racial slurs are offensive; but to others, it just shows how cruel and horrible the world can be.  In my perspective, I just feel that the authors of these books are just writing and lets the creativeness take over.  That MONTH1 be it, it MONTH1 not.     In so many words, I say that the 'offensive' books, magazines, music, movies and other materials should stay on the shelf.  For so many reasons I have said, and the ones I have not said, they help people learn.",0

"ORGANIZATION1, ore and more people use computers DATE1, but this is not necessarily a good thing. Spendign too mcuh time on computers affects your activity level. Also. Kids are now staying up later on the compute, in turn lowering grades. Finally, spending too much time on the computer decrease the amount of time spent with friends and family. Firstly, spending too much time on the computer affects your activity level. The more time spent has on a computer, the less time a person has to do something active, like exercising PERCENT1 of people spend more than NUM1 NUM2 hours on the computer per day, if NUM3 or so hours were used to exercise or play a sport that number would decrease to PERCENT2 according to a recent study. Doctors have said that at least PERCENT3 of overweight parents spend most o ftheir time on the computer, thus limiting their time exercising. The amount of spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and effect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere. If we want to become a healthier country, we should state CAPS5 writing time spent on computers. Also kids now stay up later on computers and lower then grades CAPS5 doing so. More time spent on CAPS1 or anywhere on the CAPS2 means less time studying, which means lower grades. Kids in spent an average of NUM3 NUM2 hours on the computer each day, while kids spend NUM6 NUM2 hours each day. A student in PERSON2 saw their grades improve from a CAPS3+ to a CAPS4+ just CAPS5 spending less time on the computer and more. That studnet also felt more because they get more computer. This tests and quizzes. Computers clearly negative effect on grades and school work. Finally, computers limit the amount of time spent with family nd friends. A student, PERSON1, said that she, spent more time going out with friends now that computer isn't up all my time, CAPS5 doing this, i have a better friendshhip with all my friends than before. ""A kid that uses the computer during all of the free time spends PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who usues it in moderation. Afmilies also suffer from this a swell. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have less of a relationship with them because they don't talk or do anything together an dwill likely not know what is going on i their life or if something is wrong. As you can tell, computers also have a negative effect on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does nnot benefit society.

"The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him.

They had to modify the whole frame of the building to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work. One of the biggest obstacles was safety. Most durgibles use hydrogen to power them, and hydrogen is highly flammable. There is a great risk of the dirigibles to catch on fire when flying over such a densely populated area as New York. Another obstacle in the way of the mooring mast was the conditions at the top of the building. At the top of the Empire State Building, there are violent winds that would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Lastly, An obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As explained in LOCATION1, because of this law, it is illegal to even fly up to the Empire State building. With all of these obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast wasn't used.",0
"I think that the author uses this quote, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again. CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother? BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone. CAPS2 from Vietnam to LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable.",0

"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents, and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author.",0

Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations"". This creates a warm mood because the kitchen seems like a very friendly place due to the people gathering together.Another way the author creates the mood is by saying that ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". (paragraph NUM2)These are the ways of the author of ""Narciso CAPS1"" created the mood in this story.",0
"I feel that the people using computers benefits our society. I feel this way because computers give people the ability to learn about far away places: and people have educational websites, and even allow people to talk online with other people. First of all computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. When I was in sixth grade I had to do a project on ORGANIZATION1 didn't know anything about him. But, luckily we have computers so I was able to ORGANIZATION2 on a computer and found a wodd or information on him and got an a plus on the project. Also, when I was in fourth grade I had to do a project on LOCATION1. I went on a computer went on CAPS1.com a get lots of imformation and got on a plus. The second reason computers are benefitial to the society is because computers have educational websites. Computer technologist PERSON1 saids, ""CAPS2 percent of the computers websites are educational. I also remember when i was in seventh grade the whole class went on CAPS3. com and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time. Last but not the least, computers allow people to talk with other people from around the world. Theres a website calle myspace.com and it allows me and other people to talk online around the world. I asked my class and ninety percent of them go on myspace.com. On the other hand the computer does have cons. Some kids go on unprohibited websites that are not for minors. Theres a website called NUM1.com and it has shooting and killing games that are not for kids. Also, some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty four seven. Now, you know my reasons, why computers are good to the society, they give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, have educational websites, and even allow people to tlak to other people online. What is your choice in these actions.",0
"The builders of the Empire States Building encoutered many obstacles in the attempt to allow blimps to dock on the building. The engineers realized from the start that even if they could get a blimp docked, it would put additional stress on the buildings structure. to fix this, they had to reinforce the entire building. In addition to this, the docking of a blimp was dangerous in itself. It could easily be destroyed like the Hindenburg",0
One time I was patient was at my dad house. Our power had just went out so we figured wait up to two minutes just like it always happened. after a couple days we didnt have power I was ill patient. On day three we called people and figured out ???ahead our power lines they fixed it and we got our power back.,0
"I think that computers are great for researching things like for a car or sereach for people places and thing. ORGANIZATION1 are great because you keep in touch with you family and friends. Like you can email them webcam chat and you can instant message them.I think a lot of people should get into ORGANIZATION1 because you can do everything on them. You can save you picture, download music, play games. People say that some people spend to much time on the ORGANIZATION1 well i think they should because they should learn new and different things about different countrys city or even states. I don't think there is noting wrong about spending time on a ORGANIZATION1.",0
"The builders of the Empire State building seem blind of all the dangers that would be a result of the mooring mast. One huge factor in danger was the violent winds at that elevation. The blimp would be swung around on the tether going to the building, which could either damage the building itself, or damage the blimp. Alsoif  the blimp was moving, how would passangers get on and off? They could fall off the loading dock whether they were going on or off the blimp. Passengers could even get blown off the open floor of the Empire State building. Another factor was the high population of New York City, if something like debris had fallen down to the streets, it could probably kill a few walking pedestrians. I would think that the architects would have considered all these factors before trying to begin the project.",0
My grandma was patient for NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept haveiry mastakes with it like they spelled her last name wrong so it had to be called back and retiped everytime they retipped it they would make a mastakes five times in a row and it takes a long time to prosses and we needed to pay our pills so we wouldnt get kicked out. We also needed a new car and clothes. Our car ready to break down and our clothes we out grow. When my grandma finally got her check we went strait out and got a brand new car. and clothes. I think my grandma was pretty patient after they had to re do it over five time I know it wouldnt be able to be that patient without loseing  it.,0
The author ended the story with that sentence because in the spring Saeng is going retake the test and her hibiscus will finally be budding. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed it the CAPS1 time she took. That is why the author put that sentence at the end of the story.,0
"In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isnt described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isnt in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living , when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in.",0
"I believe the author of winter Hibiscus used this for the last paragraph because it is saying when she sees that hibiscus it will give her memories of home again which will bring encouragement for the test. The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass the test and try like the new country. Saeng explains, she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the NUM1) this quote creates a vivid image in my mind that lets me know Saeng will really go and take that test when she has encouragement from not only the geese but the hibiscus also.",0
"I've recently finish reading a quote of the great author, Katherine Paterson, and her feelings towards the certain type of material use in books. For example some CAPS1 MONTH1 be offended be certain type of language used in books. Other MONTH1 just feel the pictures are not quite approprite. With that being said, I believe that if there's a certain material presented in a book that you feel uncomfortable with, you should just pick up another book instead.      My beliefe is that many authors feel like a book is a place where they can write their thoughts and beliefs about things that happen in this world. Authors shouldn't be denied the oppertunity to write a book just because of the way they express their feelings. CAPS1 shouldn't be allow to give hateful opion just because they didn't like a book. As I see it no one is forcing them to read it.       Now I'm not saying I'm a huge reading. As a matter of fact I barely read but when i do start reading I sometimes am eager to keep on reading. The way authors discribe things even with sometimes profanity is just amazing. You can actually feel that you're part of the book. Now then my point is that even though to many CAPS1 a book MONTH1 be horrible but to others it MONTH1 be the best book in the world.       So if you do start taking down books from the shelfs you would ended up with nothing but a huge, empty shelf. There's no book out there that is what we would consider, ' The perfect book.' CAPS2 book can be given a nasty comment but then again CAPS2 book can also be given the best comments.       This world is to big to start picking and choosing. My beliefs won't be the same as yours but this is how i feel and this is how i will keep on feeling. So tell me, what's your belief then?",0
One beautiful morning CAPS1 went to renew his lisence. But me though if he wake up really early he would be the only one there. But of course he wouldn't be the only one there.

"Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well people have the right to look at what they want, to hear what they want. Some think its not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves.Some people think its alright. I gusse it all just depends on that person and thier feelings.      Lets say i was in the library and i did see  something offensive. well the world does not stop and say ''hey look at that ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so lets take that off the shelves just to please her''.  Am sorry but thats not how life works. If you dont like looking at it then turn the  other way. If it were me i would be worried about more important things such as war or things going  on in my life other then something offensive on the book shelves.     Its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. There are going to be things in life we the people dont like to look at, to maybe hear thats offensive. Heres what i say to it, get over it .

If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he wouldve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings.

"Computers are one of the best advances in technology ever made. Not only are computers fun but they're also very beneficial to society. First off, comptuers are great way to communicate with other people whether it's instant-messageing, email, video-messaging, or services like ORGANIZATION1. DATE1, Computers offer many learning opportunities. There are thousands or websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky. Last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everday needs. To begin, computers are a great source of communication. I remember a time when my father traveled to LOCATION1 on business. Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service, my dad could not call using his cell phone. Instead, my father called using ORGANIZATION1. It was great because it was right on the computer. Besides making live communication easier, computers also help to communicate news, weather few weeks ago, the the home was out. It was to shout the DATE1, so my family had no way to. Since are than our cable provider, we were able to look up. School was indeed our computer, we world. Plus, computers offer more learning opportunities. Aside from being a great source of communication, computers are fantastic for searching and research. For almost all of my school assignments that required research, I've used a computer. Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree. More than half the time, the internet has beyond enough information for what I need. Studies show that NUM1 out of NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book, did. Also, computers make life a whole lot easier. Computers make life so much easier. From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arangements, computers help to make everday chores a lot easier. When my cousing was in highschool, she was assigned a NUM3 word essay for homework. First off, it's pain having to count everyword and also, most importantly it's no fun having to write that much so my cousin decide to just type it. It saves time and is way neater. She finish her typed essay in NUM4 hour while love friend finished in an NUM4 NUM42 hours because she hand wrote it. Its you on computers are esier. To conclude, computers are beneficial because they're a great source of communication, they offer many learning opportunities, and they make life so much easier. Thank you for reading, and I hope I've persuaded you to agree with my position that computers are one of the best advances in technology ever accomplished and why they are so beneficial to society.",0
"A lot of CAPS3 today are censored because of the content in books, music, movies, and Magazines. I think that it all can be fixed if you have certain sections, CAPS1 CAPS2, and my views on the censorship of CAPS3. Here's my idea to fix the problem.      I understand that books and other material MONTH1 offend certain people, but it might not offend others. Thats why I think CAPS3 should have a room for things that might offend certain people. The sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room. There could be seperate rooms for children. It has nothing but children's books, movies, music, and magazines. Its a great idea because your child would'nt be open to the bad content.      This brings me to my next topic. You must be a certain CAPS1 to enter the 'bad content' room. I dont think the library staff or their parents want a five-year old boy checking out a book that deals with sex, drugs, and alcohol. The library could get in a lot of trouble. The CAPS1 CAPS2 could be NUM1 years of CAPS1 to enter the room. That seems fair enough. Your old enough to be able to handle the content.      I dont get offended easily, so I can read just about anything. Like I suggested previously in the article, the bad content should be moved to a room so that people dont mistakenly come across it. I like reading about anything and everything, so I would love to read things and spark my attention. Books like that usually deal with bad things. I'm okay with that, but I understand that others are not.      Seperate rooms, CAPS1 limits, and my views are all good ideas. Maybe a library will come across my article and do what I have said. I think that will be very affective. I hope to start seeing that in the future",0
"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle builders faced was the building's CAPS1. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the [Empire State Building] held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's Frame."" Another obstacle in the way was nature itself.

"The author includes this last paragraph in the story, Winter Hibiscus to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengs eyes now swept over her. Saengs mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in LOCATION2 that she is not used to. When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.",0
"Pornography, vulgar language, grotesque scenes and many other things make books and movies inappropriate for some. In a culture like the one we have DATE1, censorship usually takes the back seat. The media constantly portrays sensual elements and the language is also bad. People have always had a right to view what they want and read what they want due to the freedom that this very country provides. Every person is titled with their own opinion but there should not be censorship in libraries.     There are many things in libraries DATE1 that portray bad images and contain questionable content. Books and movies have things in them that indeed children shouldn't view, but the library is not able to take them down. People enjoy seeing and hearing these things, that's why CAPS1 comes out with more rated CAPS2 movies than all the other ratings combined. They make the most money off of them. In DATE1's economy, the library needs to keep these things on their shelf so that they can stay in business. If people are offended by it, then stay away from that area and don't pick up the book or movie. If someone were to decide to take down a book or movie that they view as offensive then they are breaking the freedom that this has. Censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own.     As one can see, the censorship of books and movies is not entitled to a personal opinion. It is the duty of the library to keep the freedoms of the people and provide them with the entertainment that they want. Books and movies with adult content in them can also provide insight on what a society should not be like. Parents should modify what their children watch, but as an adult they are able to watch or read anything that they want to",0

"A library is a place to go when inneed of solitude and peace with researching or reading. There is no reason other than someones opion to why certain materails should be removed from libraries. We the people have a right to read what others have composed thourgh their thoughts and ideas.      Certain materail MONTH1 be offensive to different people, but to the others that could use that materail for research or for pleasure reading, would not be fair. If certain materials were removed because of someones action to there personal or religious opion, then those materials would nopt be avalible for those that would need to posess that information.     Did anyone think when they asked for the certain offensive materail to be removed? If people did they would relize that someone had to put an enormous amount of effort to get that infomation out to the world. How do you think that author would feel? You just had their best work pulled from the shelfs because you think it is offensive. How would you feel if some to your best peice of writing and complained that libraries cannot put this on their shelfs because its offensive.     There has been certain matierals I have listen to or read tht I thought could be offensive to certain people, but that is the media that writes the society as we read it. Some of those people MONTH1 have certain religions that say they can't read or listen to certain things. Maybe not even watch certain materials but others, that might be there part of livlyhood.     We can't just take materials off the shelfs of libraries. That material is the life blood of our society. If you cut the blood flow, bad things are bound to happen after that.

"Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  CAPS1 quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate.  If we got rid of all of the books from CAPS1 world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.       If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about.  Children should be allowed to read books such as ORGANIZATION1, The CAPS2 CAPS3, and CAPS4 CAPS5 in order to get a taste of how much times have changed.  Stories from grandparents only take a person back about NUM1 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years.  Some families, such as an CAPS6 CAPS7 family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history.  It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated.  We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.     Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted.  Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture.  How is a young girl from a small town in LOCATION2 supposed to find out how people in LOCATION1 live their life?  For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos.  I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society.  Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well.  If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.     Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves.  Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style.  Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows.  There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation.  Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality.  Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or CAPS1 world.       Now, some parents MONTH1 have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids.  If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally.  They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.     Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in CAPS1 world is beyond me.  It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides.  It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding.  Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful.  They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source.  Without them, we would be and have nothing",0
The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness and thankfulness. In the memoir the author talks about how greatful he is to his parents and how happy he was when he lived with them.,0
"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood of this is full of love and happiness.When Narciso is talking about his mother and father he starts to talk about how they always loved and cared. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that the whole house was filled with love because of Narciso's parents. Also,the way Narciso talks about his parents shows that he lovef his parents. This also showed happiness because since he would never forget his home in must've been nice there. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This shows that the house was full of happiness and warmth. This is because of all the friends, family, and celebration. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood of this is full of love and happiness.",0
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in so many ways. Some ways the cyclist was affected is, the lack of water was the biggest problem he had. The group of the old guys that gave him directions werent a big help at all. The men gave the cyclist directions be what they remember when they were younger in age. The cyclist knew not to take directions from the old men, but they seemed so sure about what they were talking about to him. The cyclist first had determination to get to his destination. As he begin to get hotter and more thirster into giving up. As soon as he was about to give up his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him now. He stumbled across water.",0
"The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didnt have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old guys who didnt know much didnt help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel",0
"Censorship is when a group of people agree that a certain book, song, movie, or magazine is found offensive in any way. Mainly parents and educators find these materials such as books offensive and do what they can to get this book taken out of libraries at schools. Censorship was originally started during the 'CAPS1 CAPS2' in LOCATION3 with the CAPS3 CAPS4. It was used to hide information from the public by taking all records of it away from the public's use.      In LOCATION2, we are a democracy, but we still choose censorship to hide certain information from certain people. In some parents' opinions books are great and educational for children, but in other parents' opinions books do things like promote homosexuality, use false language, or even show drug use. Most of these books are not trying too promote these things but they are just part of the story. So pretend like we hide all the bad events or situations in the world from occuring infront of our children. They have no knowledge of this part of life, so what happens when they get in the real world and grow up? We can't just hide drugs from them, we can read these and teach them the harm drugs can do to someone and how to avoid them. If we send our children out into this world without any knowledge of drugs things will get out of control. Majority of these books that contain 'harmful' things to children, but they teach lessons that parents don't think of, they just think of what written down on the paper instead of the moral overall lesson that the story is bringing to a child. If a story has false language, our child will ask us what these words mean and we will tell them not to use them and what they mean so the child knows not to repeat them. If not, they can go into school and another child will tell your child to say these words and your child (not knowing the meaning of the word) will go out and say it and be awarded with a detention or even a suspension. Personally, I don't want my child receiving a detention or suspension.      Censorship is a growing issue in the LOCATION1. It can do good things like hide actual sexual interactions from children, which should be hid from children anyways. Censorship can also do the bad things like I discussed earlier, which do more harm on a child then good. When your asked on your opinion on sensorship, just always remember what's best for your child, and knowledge is always better then clueless",0
There were several different moods created by the author some were CAPS1 peacful. Like he was talking about his first CAPS2 warmth of the kitchen cuban the feast. The mood of courage of his parents moving to the united States. Hes admiration strenth and perseverance for his parents. The faith the struggle hard times.,0
"One day on my way to school I went to pick up my friend he told me that he had this new game called call of duty world at war he just kept on talking about it and what he dose online then last class of the day he sat by me and said I cant wait to go home and play my new game then I said cool then he said start complaining but I have to wait one more hour.

The mood projected by the auter is that of a nice and cozy place where the stayed and were always nicee. They let anyone into their home and kept eachother safer from the racists.,0
A time I was begin patient was when I was in line to go se CAPS1 CAPS2 the line was so long I was dideing to leve but I did not whant to lose my place in line so when I got in the pace the line was longer than out side so I was patient so when I got in the movie was over I was so mad that I got home and whit to sleep.,0
"Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved",0
The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next DATE1. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph.,0
"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, alot of problems were faced in allowing the dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles that were faced would put peoples safety at risk. One of the problems was the tail of the dirigibles would swirvle because of how high up it was the wind would be violent. Another problem that was stated in paragraph NUM1 was forgeign dirigibles were made with hydrogen instead of helium so they were flamable.",0
"One time I should patient was when I friend same thy that I wanted for long time. As soon as I got here I charged towards the computer to see did was still available. ""CAPS1."" I sad try am plently, it was still there. It had taken me sad a long time to sort up for it. As I quickly went thought the order into I was thinking ""CAPS2 is will be so am some once I get CAPS2."" CAPS3 I pressed the conform order but CAPS3 and. they got the also and now for the hard part the wating. I went school the next day and the next, and for a week CAPS2 continued till I thought was how coal it would be to finly get CAPS2. I took the long buss ride home. CAPS3 got off waiting when it would come. I surged over to the mail box to get the mail and I found a box. My heart hoped and beat faster CAPS3 I ran inside and ward it up and there, it was my CAPS4 new I pad buck I was so, so happy and all of ""my patience had payed off I had got it.",0
"Patientce is hard for example when you walk in to a CAPS1s office you must patiently wait your turn to see the CAPS1. Patience is just another word for wait you have to be wait to see the CAPS1. But instead most people say cant you patiently wait to see the CAPS1. But instead most people say cant you CAPS2 wait to see the CAPS1. Patience is hard for some people. Many people cannot patiently wait to see a CAPS1. another example is CAPS3 when familys go on a road trip you here CAPS3 say mom when are we gonna get there, and that is my weakness we, well that is a sign of no patience. Whats so ever so what I would say if someone came up to me and said what is patience? I would say wait wait your turn, ??? for the dos, wait for the CAPS1, and wait for us to get there.",0
In the ORGANIZATION1. Narciso Rodriguez tells about his life at home when he was a child. The mood of this story is happy because he tells how selflessness his parents were and how his family always looked out for one another even though they werent the richest family they still stuck together. In paragraph NUM1 it says how the teachings have stuck with him his whole life and how import family and his friends were to him which creates a warm setting.,0
The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says Saeng vowed silently to herself which means she wants what is best for herself.,0
"PERSON2 stepped out of his warm house and out into the cold, blowing air. He slowly walked, staggering on the ice, out to the barn. The barn was unlike any other. It was a pitching barn. PERSON3 trained many softball pitchers and catchers in this barn, including me. I was already in the barn, and I had turned on the heater. I was warming up, doing wrist flicks, 'k-s', one leg throw, arm circles, and screw ball flicks. My catcher, PERSON1, caught the ball everytime. PERSON3 said, CAPS1. Let me see your screwball and rise ball."" I took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball. It curved right and the glove cracked."" ""CAPS2! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high five!"" PERSON1 said. I slapped her hand and we both said ""CAPS3!"" ""CAPS4, CAPS4 good. Now throw me a rise,"" PERSON2 said. I threw one. PERSON3 gave me pointers after I had thrown three rise balls."" You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more,"" he said. He never lost patient with me. Not ever after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many more pitches I had finally got it. We finished our pitching session ten minutes later. PERSON3 told me I was doing great. He said we would work on it again on DATE2."" CAPS5 is DATE1. Right?""I asked ""CAPS6 day!"" he said cheerfully. He gave me a hug. I love PERSON3. Not just because he is my dad. Also he is a great man. Happy, funny sweet and patient PERSON3.""",0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years.",0
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way. Having desert rahas makes you want to just lay their and not try to go any further, because you dont know where and end will be. As for grassy, flowery land its more of a sense rout, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist.",0
"Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson.     In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the CAPS1 CAPS2. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a CAPS2 in her life. After helping her find the CAPS2, she ask, 'CAPS5 is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of CAPS6 and CAPS5 this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about.     It is against the law in some states that a CAPS2 be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunatley, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?",0
"When one person is giving a right to do something, then everyone else should have the right to do the same thing. But every so often, you have someone that abuses their rights to something.          I belive that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a right on a library shelf. And they shouldn't be romoved if they are found offensive because in almost every book someone reads, there will be some kind of offence in it.          I also belive that all books, music, movies, magazines, and everything else has a pupose to it. And if the purpose is good enough for it to be published than, it should have a good message worth delivering to people, even if it is a little offensive.     I've read a few books, watched a few movies, and heard a few songs that were offensive even to me in some way. But, considering that there was more of a purpose to it, and the purpose being a good message, I liked the few movie and songs that most people would say its 'junk'. I don't have alot of experiences because there isn't a lot that I can say is offensive, but the few songs, movies that are offensive to even me, I belive that there was some kind of good message there.     I personally think that no one should have a right to take a book, a peice of music, a magazine, or anything else off a library shelf. Because everything has some kind of purpose to it, and has some kind of message in it for each and every person to discover",0
"The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be There was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadent been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly.",0
"the obstacles the builders went threw was using hydrogen which is flammable.

"I believe that people should be able to go on the computers and still be doing it. For a good reason such as communicating with far away relatives. Another reason is, if you need a ORGANIZATION1 work-out or healthy eating tips, you can just print them out. And my last reason is if you're going on a far away trip but you don't know the way, you can just print out directions (ORGANIZATION2). Say if you have a relative that lives all the way in CAPS1 but you can't call them because you live all the way in the LOCATION1 And if you call them, it'll cost you about MONEY1 per minute. What you can do is you can contact them over the computer (webcam). And it's way better than just calling them because you can actually see them. Or if your on a business trip away from home, you can check upon your family. My second reason is, you can stay fit while being on the computer. You can look up ORGANIZATION1 ""yoga"" poses. Or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer. And if you're on a diet, you can look up ORGANIZATION1 healthy recipes. You can also get ORGANIZATION1 work-out equipment that'll make (or keep you), nice and slim. My last reason is that if you're going on a long journey away from home you need to now the way. But, what if you don't know the way? You can go on the internet and look up directions. And that is way better because at least you arent wasting money on a MONEY2 ORGANIZATION3. And it is more and quicker. And the best part is that you don't have to keep looking at the ORGANIZATION3 and program stuff. With the maps on the computer, you can print it out and actually keep it. Those are all my reasons to why people should really go on computers. There are many things that a computer can do which is really good. You can communicate with relatives, stay fithealthy while on the computer and getting maps. I hope that this opens up many peoples eyes. And maybe change a couple scientist's mind.",0
"The mood that was created CAPS1 the CAPS2 is a happy, loving mood. The reason I say this is CAPS3 if you read the passage you'll see that in his home it wass all about love and care.

"The Empire State building was not a good place to attach a blimp to. One reason why it never worked out was because of safety issues. In every country except the PERSON1, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and shouldn't be flown over a densely populated area. Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the wind speeds at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be tied down on the front and back. Next they would need to make sure the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law against low-flying over urban areas. The biggest issue was how they never finished their plans. Even after NUM1 dollars worth of modifications the building was not finished.",0
"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First the building had a flat roof and a dirigible moored to the top, only held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame. Modifications to the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Other problems the building faced had to do with safety. Some dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable and if an accident were to happen in New York it would be disastrous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting and even tethered to the mooring mast, the ship would not be secured. This was also very unsafe. The Empire State Building never succeeded it's purpose.",0
"The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the main character the cyclist.

"Hot, lack of water, lost-all are how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, it was hot. In one sentence he say the sun was beginning to beat down. Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performence. How was because he was dieing in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasnt what he expected. But in the end he was relifed. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive.

So try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life.",0
"I do not believe computers benefit society. Many people spend their life on their computer instead of exercising, going out with friends, or spending time with family. NUM1? Of CAPS1 will agree they spend at least NUM2 hours a day on their computer. Which is unneccessary. Why is there so much obesity in the world nowadays? Because of a lack of CAPS3. And who is the #NUM3 cul? Computers of course. In order for more people to maintain healthy, there needs to be a lot of CAPS3. When someone can sit around all day clicking a mouse or typing keys in, how much CAPS3 are they really getting? Plus, there are many different disorders in the world. PERCENT1 inf will agree that with more CAPS3, these sometimes painful disorders could be avoided. Too many people are choosing their computer overexercise and it them many health problems that could've easily been avoided. Secondly, everyone would agree that friends are essential in life. But now people are talknig to their friends online or in computer games instead of going to the them. Online there is much more which often break up friendship. Also, online you new people or make as many new friends. CAPS2 you go and have many more friends, which makes life in general much better. Finally, you wouldn't wants families become would you? Well, this is one of the many effects the CAPS2 members of a family get together which could weaken them as a family. Plus, husbands and wives could not talk very often, often leading in separation or devorce. This could make a child have in decide between a whole family to CAPS3, friends, and family are essential in life, and computers put those in jeopardy. So take a stand and end this reign for good, stop the use of computers before it is too late.",0
"The mood created by the author in this memoir would be grateful and happy. It really makes you wanna think about life and how good it is, thanks to parents and grandparent, even anchestors. It makes you want to love your parents even more seeing how they went through alot and probably gave up alot for you. Like leaving their homeland or giving up great things like ORGANIZATION1 and Narciso Rodriguez Sr did for their family or son. They wanted a better life and education for their kids. They had to leave their homeland, where they were born and raised and give up some things to get better things. They had to give up their job and skill's they already knew how to do for better things. The good thing that happened or that they get is more freedom and better life and education, it's not easy leaving everything you love and where you are born but has to be done for better things and opportunities.

I do not easily get affended so i don't know what some things would be offincive but i guess that black poeple would be offincive of a rasist book?     I don't think that porn or anything involving nudety should be used in school library's because some parents are very stricked about that kind of stuff and that is very inapropriet for school. I think some parents take it over the top with whats inapropriet and what's not. Library's that are just public library's are totally diffrent and should be able to have any movies and any books. It should not be a big deal on what there about. If the people don't like it they don't need too look at it or get it.      So, i think that library's should have all diffrent kinds of books and movies. If the people don't like it then they can leave, and don't have too worry about it. That is what i have too say about that problem. I hope that this has changed or proswaded you alittle bit",0

Some problems that the builders faced building the mast on the top of the building was that the builders couldn't just drop the mast on top of the building's flat roof because then the wind would cause stress to the frame because the blimps could hanging there.

If more people get of CAPS1 and CAPS2, I'm positive all would be resolved. I'm sure that the computer is affecting everyone negatively. Obesity is a huge problem in LOCATION1. One in five children are obese. I feel the computers is contributing to the problem. I remember times when I wanted to go outside and exercise, but the computer dragged me away wih all the fun games and videos the internet sure, the computers fine in moderation, but many people abuse their privellages. Obesity leads to many such as dogged arteries or strokes. No parents wants to see their go through young. But if from of to fix it? taking away for many. Everybody these dayrace people have so much effort making. I's sure I would have had across time if went people have probably done. Good times. Family to take time from away from us. In conclusion, I feel the computer is an addiction. Millions who on the computer gain weight. Also, it takes time enjoy nature but the computer blocking the way.

"There are many things in this world that childeren should not see and that poisen the minds of them and others whatever age they MONTH1 be. The things people see these days can be bad and shouln't be seen by anybody of any age. These things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also.     The reason that I think that no one of any age should think about these bad things is because if kids shouldn't know about them than, then why should the same kid that has grown up know these same thing. But if things like this are in libraries thenthe question is who should be in charge of deciding what is right for wroung?      Sence the worlds population is so large and so many people have diferent ideas then how could we get one person to look through all things and decide between good or bad? Well the awnser would be that it is impossible to. That is why it is up to the head of the family to decide what to do about this crisis.",0
"you sit down at the computer with a glass water and an afterschool snack, possibly an after work snack. You log on to your many accounts, open some chat boxes with your friends & start researching for your project. As more & more people log on to technology, they seem to come out with new things for computers. Some people are missing out, & dont see the negatives, like social relationships failing, procrastinatting, lack of learning & more! Beep! one new CAPS2 message. On the computer you can talk to your friends & family, but sometimes people are on so much that in real life relationships fail. You cant type a ORGANIZATION1 message or hide your feelings behind a screen. Also for kids when they get older, many jobs require customer service, and if you only are good at talking to people on the computer, it cant help you. Whatever you say on the internet can be read & posted anywhere, any site, any time, whereas in real life its really you talking. School are learning are very important too, but sometimes I know I have homework but procrastinate and say ""CAPS3 CAPS4 do it later, i need to check this out!"" putting my learning to a stop. Some people dont like school, but its very important in a persons life if you like to be successful, you need to balance school, learning, computer time, and dont forget exercise & possibly work! Computers can be helpful with research & guides, but facebook or twitter is going to slow you down. So buckle down start that research! Chatrooms, ORGANIZATION2, email and other things can be harmful to you. There are many predators out there who are just waiting for anybody to log on. Its very dangerous, and someone can pretend to be someone there not. Also, computer all day with no exercise can lead to obesity, and sometimes your hands posture can give you carpal tunnel syndrome. There are many bad things that result from computers. Many times in your life youll need to find a balance. Dont overlook the negative or you could get hurt. Computers are nice to have, but be careful not to whittle away all of your time on it!",0
"The terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them. The first example of this is in they are riding on hills, it makes it much harder for them. For example when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on hills he was, olcasly disappointed. Another thing that affects cyclist is the smothness of the road they are riding on. In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the main character came to rough spot in the road and was disappointed and didnt want to ride it. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat. Several times in the story, the cyclists says that he is tired and dehydrated, at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke. Those are the effects of the riders setting have on himher.",0
"Cencorship in books is one of the main concerns in LOCATION1. If it was up to me to remove a book from a shelf, I would not do it, to my personal opinion, I think that we as CAPS1's should just read over the probloms and quit complaining about it. Yes, we do have some books that people seem to not like, such as 'The CAPS2 of ORGANIZATION1', but the only reason that it has been pulled off the shelfs of librarys and schools is because it uses the word 'nigger', and I find it to be kind of idiodic, that people would over react to that word when themselves were not even around to know the real meaning of.     Cencorship in music. This is another big concern for people in LOCATION1. The lyrics used in most songs I find to be 'disturbing' or are trying to get people and young kids to comite acts of crime and other illigal acts. Music such as rap and the lyrics used in rap are whats making kids do stupid stuff, the music talks about sex, drug usage, and murder. I don't think that I would go as far as to pull it off the shelf, but I would make the sellers put them in a 'can only perchas if NUM1' section. Most of the crime we have today people blame on music.     To my observation about these subjects are that I have seen people read a book that uses profound language in it and be ok with it, they don't over react to it so therfor it shouldn't be removed from shelfs. To my observation about the rap music, sure, in a way it should be pulled off the shelfs and never be sold again, but, I have seen people who listen to it and never smoke, never kill, and never harms another person. To my own experience I listen to some of these gore obbsessed bands and read profound languaged books and got over it, these thing should be overlooked and forgotten.     This is just a common scence thing but, there are a lot of things that should be pulled off shelfs, I would, and it has to do with movies and magazines. Some movies have always been a problom to society, I have witnessed this that some movies show just a little bit to much nudeity in it, which I seem to think is not a good thing that our younger children should see, whether it's at the theater or on t.v. this things should be pulled.     My observation about magazines it that I have personal her one of my best friends say that 'I want to look as skinny and this girl does on this magazine because I'm to fat'. There are a lot of magaziens that should not be showed or read because it does say that skinny is better and so many girls and women are starving themselves to look like the person on the cover of a magazien, and it's rediculous to see that happen, If it was my choise, I would ban these matirals from useage or sight, mainly because this is all just one big peer presure conspericy. I would not ban all of the things that I have put in this paper, just the things that I that personal find disturbing or not fot the publics eye's.",0
"Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The invention of computers is the single most important event of the DATE1. PERSON1, a professor at ORGANIZATION3 says that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, CAPS3 have discovered NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer."" A report in ORGANIZATION1 stated that PERCENT1 of fortune NUM2 companies are run soley by computer programs. ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other PERCENT2 of fortune NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the CAPS1 CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This CAPS2 maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. This oppurtunity allows you to imerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands. CAPS4 once said ""CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" CAPS4 meant that if CAPS3 know about people and places different than use, CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of CAPS5, ORGANIZATION2 and CAPS6, CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its NUM4 million users, NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was NUM6, my friend PERSON2 move to LOCATION1. CAPS3 missed each other until I turned NUM7 and ORGANIZATION2 was invented. CAPS3 were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and CAPS3 immeadiatly started video chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people that think the advent of computer has affected communication. I belive that it is an effective too that everybody should have access to.",0

"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigible use different gases to stay aloft. As stated in paragraph 6, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be droped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.",0
"In this fascinating story ""The Mooring Mast"" written by author Marcia Amidon Lüsted tell about the Empire State building, & it's enormousity. Although constructing this building took workers time and strength they didn't exactly get the purpose of the mooring mast. There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down. Author Marcia writes ""but using these at the empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe."" That's how & there's many more reasons why workers have trouble building the mooring mast.",0
"CAPS4 many people think comptuers are bad there are many reasons as to why they are good. Computers are very environmental friendly and so are PERCENT1 DATE1 people today. They also allow us to type assignments and other important papers. People also don't know that they are not the worst ORGANIZATION1 on the market today. Computers MONTH1 take away time from people that they should be spending on excersice, but computers arent the only thing that do that more people spend time watching CAPS5 then they do on any other activity, PERSON2 head DATE1 ORGANIZATION1 conducted a survey in DATE1. His survey showed that out DATE1 the NUM1 people questioned PERCENT2 spent NUM2 hours a day watching CAPS5, PERCENT3 spent NUM3 hours on the computer, PERCENT4 spent NUM4 hours reading and PERCENT5 spent NUM4 hours excersising. So clearly computers are not our biggest problem. Many people today are ""CAPS7"" or ""CAPS8-environment"". So instead DATE1 buying newspapers or magazines most people go online to research current events. PERSON1, CAPS9 DATE1 the ORGANIZATION2. Says if we use comptuers instead DATE1 newspapers PERCENT6 DATE1 the trees we cut down each year will be save. So obviously computers are environment friendly. Todays youth is messier than it ever was. CAPS10 are having a hard time grading papers and tests because DATE1 kids hand writting. So instead DATE1 handwritting papers, kids make it easier on CAPS10 by typing their work. Rescent studies show that PERCENT7 DATE1 CAPS10 find it easier + better for kids to type papers. This shows kids are better off typing papers, and assignments. I hope you now understand my position on computers. The help us in many other ways too. In conclusion, they are not as time-consuming as every one MONTH1 think. They also help us with research, are enviromental-friendly, and help the youth DATE1 our world become neater one click at a time.",0
"Memoirs have a certain mood that the author usually works around with. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author explains his family in a very CAPS1 way. The author talks about his love of cooking, how his parents want to give their children a better life by moving to LOCATION1 leaving loved ones behind, and the author CAPS1 his house.The kitchen was the very heart of the home to the author. His parents was very skilled in cooking, which passed onto their children. The author says on paragraph NUM1, "" A love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author's love for culinary skills. Next, is how the author's parents love their children. They didn't know anything about LOCATION1, but moved there just to give a better life for their children. The parents had to leave their loved families, friends, and country. For example, on paragraph NUM2, it explains what the parents had to. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows the parents realy loved their children wanted them to be happy. Finnaly, the last sentence of the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" states how the narator feels love for his parents and his home. This all shows that the narrator is happy with his family in pleased of where he lives. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is CAPS1 . The author shows this by CAPS1 the culinary art his parents, and his home.  He is grateful for what he has, and has love for his family and home.",0
The firsts obstacles was to make the Empire State building the worlds tallest building by adding a top or a hat to make the building a little more taller. And second obstacle was to drop people from the mooring mast to the Empire State building's flat roof.,0
"CAPS2 and kids of any age at this society, are way to focused on the latest technology. One piece of equptment that is affecting peoples lives, is the computer.

"The authors mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, could be discribed as calm, and a little sad.

Also, she talks about how ""My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them. As you can see, the authors tone in this memoir is calm, and sad.",0

"I personally don't believe they should us censorship in libraries. I feel as though no one has the right to say people are or aren't allowed to enjoy certain material just because someone MONTH1 thing that it is offensive because, thats just one persons opinion. What's one mens trash is another mens gold, what one person finds offensive could be sawt out by millions. Plus in todays world if everything was censored there would be nothing left not even church because everyone has there own opinion and there own belief. Which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at less one person who thinks something is offensive in someway, shape, or form. If everything was censored people wouldn't even be able to exspress themselfs.    If cenorship was used everywhere schools wouldn't be able to teach half of the material they teach today and kid would have nothing to involved. Author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I for one completely agree with this quote. It's true as I have already stated if everything was cenored there be nothing left to be enjoyed.    Think about it this way would you like someone telling you that your not allowed to read or listen to certain material just because someone felt as though it was offensive and thought it should be taken away from the public? I'm pretty sure that would make most people upset exspecially if they're a adult. I feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to. So if you ever get asked if censorship in libraries should be allowed then think back to everything I've said before you give your answer. Once they start censoring what everyone can read and listen to then they'll feel as though they can censor any and everything and control peoples lives.",0

"Libraries are filled with books, magazines, music, movies, and many more materials. All of the materials cover a really wide range of topics. For example, movies can be a comedy, mystery, or adventure. However, some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them. For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries.     One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers. If a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them, then they might think violent behavior is all right. They might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem.      One case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school. A straight-A student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher. This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school. She then proceded to threaten to kill the teacher. She got the idea from the movie 'CAPS1', and her costume resembled the CAPS2. Some students in the classroom at the time called NUM1, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife. Maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher.     Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. The children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out. This way no one will know that they read it. Some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them. When the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book. I have  read a book that contains sex and drugs. The book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it.     After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. The material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it does not seem like that kind of behavior could possibly come out of that person. The material can also be inappropriate for younger children. All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people.",0

"Many of us have been at the library once in our life time, but have you ever had a day when you took your little kids to the library and they grab a book or a magazine and saw something that you were not very happy with? Well many of us have. Should the library have books, magazines, or even movies that are offensive to your kids, little borthersisters, or friends?    The public library should be for anyone and everyone to come and do what they have to do, not to see a nacket picture or something that can be offensive to you or your the little kids. Well we can do something about that. Having bad pictures in a book or magazine can be bad for the kids and even the young ones like us because many young teens can get bad censorship. The books, magazines and even movies that have offensive pictures or people with no clothes on should be removed from any public library shelves. A lot of the parents do not want there kids to go to the library and look at pictures that are really offensive. They also do not want them to be checking out movies that can give them bad influins.  In the library there should be good and fun books, magazines, and movies. The people that work at the library should remove all the bad itams. Allowing to have all the nacket pictures and movies at the library will allow some teens to get bad ideas from it. This is why the libraries should remove all this books, movies, magazines, and even music! Many of the older people MONTH1 think that it is not fair for them. Well they should know that it can harm there kids and it can also teach there young kids bad stuff. Some of the older people MONTH1 think different and others they MONTH1 think the same.   Many of the parents do not want there kids to be seeing bad pictures or to check out bad movies or books. That's why removing these itams are good for many of the kids and young teens that are just learing how to have a boygirlfriend",0

"Friends are'nt always what we want them to be they arent always easy to find, but with a smile and a laugh a friendship can become. I mean what is a friendship if there isnt those moments where you laugh until you pee. When you laugh until you can't breath and you feel like you have just done one hundred sit-ups. Ofcourse you MONTH1 meet a friend like this and it MONTH1 happen when you least expect it. I didnt expect a new friendship but in a new town and with new people i met the friend i now call bestfriend.  It was the year of NUM1 and i was new to ORGANIZATION1. In homeroom everyone stared at me like i was some kind of criminal and everyone talked behind my back when i would pass by their desks, well atleast thats how i felt. My homeroom teacher PERSON2 CAPS1 me my so called schedule. Sixth period, CAPS2 class with PERSON1. What? CAPS2, what is that. I really had no idea what a CAPS2 was until i walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and well there I found out what a CAPS2 was. It was a one wheeled bike. Wow! I laughed thinking how did i not know that.  I looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around. I took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there, when in walked a girl that looked about my age. She took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her, but i was to emberrassed to. PERSON1 asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to useb the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help. Class was over and i tolde her my name was PERSON3 and she told me her name was CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a ""friend"" well atleast someone i talked to. I went into the class and she was absent so I was a loner that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl. She didnt want to ride the CAPS2, all she wanted to was talk. I was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and I had'nt practiced my unicycleing.  I was really hoping CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and she showed up. This time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall. We stared at eachother and just started laughing and laughing i couldnt breath and she almost peed. It was one of the best times i had experianced that year, and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends.  We are now really close friends and just that one moment of laughter together brought us close at heart. We love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true. everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship what braught it together was a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends nose. Its a great time and you never forget it, its something that is so simple but so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person. It braught my friendship with a person i had barley met into a friendship that is now insepreable and amazing.",0
"I see that there is an argument between computers being good or bad. I think that my oppinon can help your decision. I think that computers are good. I think they are good because they help kids with social skills, they help people with bad handwriting and they help people learn about things around the world. First of all computers help kids all around the world with social skills. They help them because these is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer. There is instant messaging and webcaming websites. Also a servey said that PERCENT1 of parents say that the computer raised there kids social skills a lot. Another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting. It helps because you can go on microsoft word and instead of writeing a great report that no one can read you can type I that when I have a paper for school that neatness counts on I always up my report. This can help alot of people who cant write as well as others because on the computer you change the font and everything to make it look as nice as you want. The last reason I think the computer is a good idea is because alot of people dont like to read newspapers and watch the news so they like to research certian subjects they like, to know whats going on around who world. I know my mom doesn't have time to watch the newest the newspaper but when she checks her email the first thing that pops up is the bigest news of the day. People all around the work go so the computer to find of the latest news. I hope you consider my oppinon when you make you decison, where you go think of all the kinds of people it helps. People with social problems, people with bad handwriting, and just busy people who cant sit down and watch the hour news. Thank you for your time.",0

I said , ''CAPS2 please''. So for about NUM1 minutes she helped me. In that time my whole class sat and did there work. That is one time when people were patient with me.",0
"Cencorship is a very large thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is sutable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see.      Firstly, people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The CAPS1 CAPS2 books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it.      Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express them selves. Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called CAPS4 CAPS5 CAPS6 CAPS7. Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their head. PERSON1 was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could.      Although, somethings we need to see the things that people have in CAPS8 heads. I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out.      In conclution, CAPS8 is no real yes or no anser. CAPS8 is always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read",0
I believe the first photograph closely relates to the story As worry because the authors son suffs a lot. And it shows what he and his friends MONTH1 look like. Also it shows the surf boards emphasizing there surfers. That is what I believe about the first picture. The second are only relate a little cause it has a surfer surfing. So in conclusion the first photograph is moreaccurate to the story than the second photo.,0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her. At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to bloom. CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to bloom.",0

"In my opinion I belive that computers have helped our society a lot over the past decade or so. This is because when you on the computer you get better hand-eye coordination. Also you learn how to type and do other things with a computer that you will need to no how to do if you want to get a decinte job that pays well. Also now on the computer you can go on facebook and other website were you can make friend and chat with other people. So its not only helping your social skills and hand-eye coordination but also you are most likly to get a good job if you no how to type and use a computer. First off, having a computer teaches you to have better hand-eye coordination. This is because when you get a computer having better hand-eye coordination will teach you how to type better and more quick. Secondly, having a computer will teach you better social skills. This is because now alot of people go on facebook and you can make friends and chat with your new ones. Also when its a cold and rainy day you can occupy youself by playing different games and also you can check the news and forecast for tommorrows weather. Lastly, when you learn how to type you have a good shot at getting a good job because you no hot to type and work a computer. This is because when you are looking for a job that pays good you will most likly have to me how to type and operate a computer.

Yes, I do think they should censor reading material, But to an exstent they need to have books for kids at certain age groups. like have sections for young kids then teens and then adults. if the child wants t read more graphic material then they must have pramission from their parent. the reason i say that is there are things that get published by authord that are ment to be read by certain people.",0
A time when laughter was one element or part was when my brother showed a youtube video to my family. The video was about a guy who was talking about his childhood when his dad told him to go to the store to get bread to make sandwiches for dinner and was told to not to get into any trouble. To avoid getting into trouble his dad told him to go across the street because there was three boys down the block that looked like trouble. So he did what his dad told him to do and he went across the street but when he was passing the boys they stopped him. One of the boys yelled out something and a bunch of their friends came flying from a that was barbershop across the street and surrounded him. He managed to get free and ran as fast as he could. He said that he was running so fast that he knew that he passed a ORGANIZATION1 because he said he was behind it and then was in front of the car running to get to his house. When he got to his house he told his dad that he did what he told. The dad was only worried about is if he got the bread and the guy was upset that his dad was worried about bread instead of him. The way the guy told his childhood memory was funny and even though I was already shown the video by brother the night before we both still thought it was funny and so did my family and we would burst out laughing at times.,0
"Laughing is the key of happiness. Is a moment that is remember by many people. You share many laughs with friends, family and sometimes strangers. When you laugh with someone it shows that you have something in common; you both think something is funny and it could build a strong relationship. For me laughing means a lot, i laugh everyday. I will not forget the time when i was really mad at my dad and then laughter fixed the problem. One night me and my dad were in my house in the kitchen and he was arguing with me about my grades. I told him I could still fix them that there was a solution. He was calling me a liar, and more anger kept on building up. He was so hard headed and I couldn't get through his thoughts. He was saying that i could not fixed what i have done: whats done is done. I was getting really mad, I wanted him to go away and i thought i was not ever going to talk to him. We had a lack of trust and i just wanted to tell him he was wrong. I knew he would have got more mad and we were gonna end up screaming at each other. It got me so mad that he couldn't listen. My dad said he wanted the best from me, and he was disappointed. I got really sad because my dad was the kind of guy that was all ways telling jokes and teasing everyone. He always made my day by making me laugh. Usually when he would get me in trouble, it would end up with a joke at the end. The jokes he made when i was sad or mad would build our relationship stronger; we would always end up laughing. Later the night we were with all my family cutting my niece's cake and me and my dad were not talking. As we were singing happy birthday i would glare at him and look down. He was looking at me as if he was all tough. Then we were all saying ""-íCAPS1 le sople!"", which means blow out the candles in CAPS2. All of the sudden my uncle blows out the candle on accident and me and my dad stared at each other and laughed so hard. We were crying of laughter and we couldn't stop laughing. It felt great laughing at the same thing and sharing a moment together and putting aside our anger. My dad would try not to laugh but the more he tried the louder his laugh was. It was only me and him who stayed laughing, everyone else giggled. As it was making my dad and my relationship better it build a connection between my family and I. Its a memory that's gonna last a life time, yet it was an important part of my dad and my relationship. Although he was still upset about my grades it was all better. There was a connection between us and we could still look back and laugh about it. I don't know what it was about the night that i found the incident so funny. As it was making my relationship stronger, the distance between me and him didn't matter it was all build up on the memory. Something me and him both share, building a part of him and a part of me. Our problem wasn't fixed but it was as if it was not important, as if laughing made you change and helped us put it aside. Every laughing moment we have now is something me and him share, its now a connection. We both can laugh about the same things and share our thoughts making us stronger. Telling me that while me and him laugh about things is just putting more the negatives away and giving life more meaning. When you know you're happy is when you have a sense of humor. Also when you have those moments with others that you will never forget. The moment when you made laughing an important part of your pass. When all those funny moments become important because that's when you showed you were happy. Its even better when you laugh most of the time because your memories will be all remembered as a happy moment. I know at times i will have moments where i am not laughing, but the key is to always look at the bright side. Even though me and my dad were mad at each other its a memory that will carry on with me forever.",0

At first, he is confident that the old mens knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on.

Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were That architects cannot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. They would also have modifie and strengthened the steel frame of the Empire State uilding and all this was going to be worth sixty thousand dollars of modifications. Theese engineers had to try to dope out a Practical workable arrangement and also the government People in washington were figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast. This idea of doing this was neither practical nor safe because all this things would be dang ling high above Pedestrians on the street.

"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there would be that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications on the framewor The greatest obstace of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.",0

Also the text said ""It was a close knit community of honest, hardworking imigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That just CAPS3 that her parants let anyone from their community who needed a family become part of their familly, or anybody who was lonley just have some company from them.",0

"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, winds shifted a lot, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. Most dirigibles during that time. Were floating by hydrogen rather than helium. With the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge issue. Air currents as high as those a top the buildings were vicious and shifted rapidly which would make it dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky. Lastly, was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law against airships flying to low over urban areas. With all these obstacles that would be too difficult for the builders face, this unreal dream would yet remain a dream.",0

"The greatest obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over your ring areas. The wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers.",0
"I agree with the concerned experts, im sure many others agree also. I bet you that if you keep reading it would be understandable, why I agree. First of all, too many people spend to much time talking with friends online. I think that once you start talking with them online, finish up the conversation face to face or by telephone. Talking online is a great way to connect with friends and people you haven't seen in a long time, but too much of that can start problems. For example rumors. In my opinion when friends get to excited online they decide to start rumors about other people and it ends up being sent to almost everybody. Another example is online arguing which can lead up to many problems like fighting when you get back to school. How would you feel if you turned on your computer and find out that someone has been talking about you or that someone is trying to start a fight with you? I'm positive that you would not enjoy it and your feeling might be hurt. Next reason is, being on the computer too much can effect most peoples grades. Many people are going home and turning on their computer instead of doing their homework or studying. There are many people who go to my school and their grades have declined because of online usage. Pretty soon many people will be held back because they have failed the school year. For example, picture yourself as a parent and getting your child's report card and find out they have all CAPS1's or mostly CAPS2's. You wouldn't like that either. Lastly, computers have cause another problem called bullying. Too many children are being bullied online and they are being hurt. Those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it while the children who are getting bullied are sad. Thinking that nobody cares about them. Bullying has caused death or many other problems. Imagine, being someone, getting bullied and your feelings are really hurt, you dont talk to an adult or a parent all you end up doing is killing yourself. Picture how many parents are upset and how yours would be too to find that their child has been bullied to death, it really hurts them. And i'm sure if you were one of those parents you wont be too happy. In conclusion, being online too much has an effect on everybody and",0

"CAPS4 whole life, I've been a child of laughter, one who did all CAPS5 could to find the joy in existence. As I've grown, CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, CAPS4 joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of CAPS4 relatives, those people never cross CAPS4 mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes CAPS4 childhood seem void or vacant (considering that CAPS4 father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that CAPS4 mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, PERSON1. CAPS5 and CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. PERSON1's always been there for us. CAPS5 even stood by CAPS4 mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after CAPS4 arrival, PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, PERSON2. They've been CAPS4 family ever since; CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of CAPS4 childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, PERSON1 and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. CAPS4 brother was born five years after I and three years after PERSON2. CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. PERSON2 and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One DATE1 TIME1, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of CAPS4 life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. PERSON1 didn't drop by. CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the LOCATION1. CAPS4 heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, PERSON1 was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" CAPS1, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, PERSON2 took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, CAPS6 laughed. ""CAPS2 isn't funny!"" I cried. His expression became serious, ""CAPS3, I... what happened?"" CAPS4 face was too buried in CAPS4 hands for me to speak, so PERSON2 took over, ""CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: ""jerk!"" CAPS6 turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further PERSON2 and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on CAPS4 body became. ""CAPS7,"" glancing over at PERSON2, I smiled, ""CAPS6 was really cute,"" I cradled CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with CAPS4 opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like CAPS2!"" CAPS4 cousin laughed; CAPS5 full on cracked up, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that stirred up in the situation tickled against CAPS4 inner stomach, and I laughed as CAPS3. The two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Looking back on all of CAPS2, I'd like to think that being a young, unintelligent, and naive adolescent brought CAPS4 cousin and I back to common grounds, but then I'd be lying. In all honesty, it was our laughter. Even in the most scary and tense situations of the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughing heals feelings, arises thoughts, and brings people together.",0

The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the empire state buildings frame.  For this reason they first had to make MONEY1 worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen it's frame (paragraph NUM1).  The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to more dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was just general safety.  After the hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as CAPS1 (paragraph NUM2).  It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph NUM3).  The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.  In the end, the fact that there was so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming reality at all.",0

"Laughter In A Relationship The most important thing in a relationship is laughter. Laughter is something we all need and it keeps us going with the world and the duties we do all day because we get frustrated a lot of times. So one thing that helps us is laughter. If someone is upset the person might watched a comedy movie or read a comic about funny or humorous characters. But many people like talking to someone when they are upset and need a uplift from them. When I was once upset regarding my school work and about not having a job. I went out for a walk after an argument with my work mother. About my grades being dropped. My mom got quite angry and my dad was also very upset with me because they knew I was much more capable than I showed in my grades. My parents knew I wanted to do a job to buy things what I wanted. They didn't think it appropriate to linger around about having a job so much and not care about my grades.When I was walking along the lake side I heard someone playing a guitar and he played it so beautifully that I wanted to meet that person instantly. I tried to find him but I couldn't and at last I just set down and wondered who that person might be. So suddenly a boy came to me with a guitar and asked me what time is it. I told him the time and asked him where he learn t to play guitar such beautifully. So he told me that he is interested in playing guitar for a long time and he wants to join a band.We both shared our feeling and we couldn't even understand that the things we never told anyone else we were telling each other  CAPS1 after that meeting we came close friends and we met everyday. He knew I was quite tensed so he used to play guitar for me and we sang songs together. He also told me jokes and I knew he was doing all this just for me and I sometimes just kept quite and didn't respond to his jokes. He got more tensed that I was not laughing or smiling. But I didn't realize that by doing this I was really making him hurt.But he never lost hope in me and he kept on telling me funny stories and we talked over the phone whole night just so that he could make my tensions a bit less and make me laugh. So one day he took me out for lunch at ORGANIZATION1's because he knew it was my favorite place and I loved going their. He took me to a comedy movie on superheroes but neither of them were making me laugh. All the time I was just in his arms. But after the movies he took me to the most beautiful place and it was near a beach and the whole place was decorated by colorful lights and we were sitting down on a swing and talking. Now he knew how he could make me happy and he told me jokes and we read comic books and surprisingly I started loving his jokes and the comics we read. Whenever I would meet him he would do something special for me and made me laugh. He once got dressed down as clown and tried to juggle balls but he couldn't do it so well and i laughed at him so badly. I know it was being rude to laugh at him but I loved spending time with him.  One day he came to my home and we were talking and he held my hands and proposed me. I was really happy to hear that and he brought me the most beautiful ring ever. He proposed me and took me out for a drive and gave me some advice in a very respectfully manner, not in a intention that he is putting me down. But I had never seen a person like him and he he told me that laughing and smiling is good for life. N o matter what happens tomorrow why should we care about it today when we have such a beautiful life waiting for us. We must live the way we want and not force our selves to change just to get serious in life. He held my hand and took me his arms and said CAPS2 matter how much we love each other but laughter is important in a relationship I looked at him and asked him why'd? So he replied we'd must be happy and to be healthy and to be with each other. After we had some time there he dropped me home and told me live life because who knows if we will be alive tomorrow. From that moment I realized that he was right and I looked at life from a different perspective from that day and decided to live life in a better way so that I laugh and enjoy.",0
"For many students it is hard to compose essay's in a public school's library. Aquiring the neccisary information is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack. This is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff. No neither of these problems is the cause behind many student's inabiltiy to compose thought provoking essay and analysis over a myrad of topics. This is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general. Many of the relevent topics and materials need to truely understand our constantly changing world is being removed from the grasp of those who will go on to lead this new world.Some prime examples of this tyrany on knowledge is the removal of books suck as PERSON1, PERSON2, the CAPS1, and many other classical works. Each of these according to many parents has good reason to be removed from our libraries. PERSON1 PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy along with being written by what CAPS3 has pegged as one of the humanity's most vile of creatures. PERSON2 uses racial surrs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children. The CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state. Many other classical works refference racism, drugs, murder, sex and use rampant profanity. All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent MONTH1 advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries.These reasons, as well meaning as they MONTH1 be, are no longer good enough to be valid in todays changing environment. Many of the books that have been recomneded to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle. As we know, 'CAPS3 is written by the victors.' CAPS4 it is good that the CAPS5 won the CAPS6 CAPS7 and helped abolish slavery it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the view point from our centers of knowledge. To forget is to remember at another time. That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again.For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbiden images to their children more than books have. To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world. Just because we try and close our eyes to the realities of the world does not mean that they don't exist. It is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb",0
"In the excerpt, The Mooring CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building had a hard task on their hands. They were building the tallest building in the world and when Al Smith, the head in the construction of the building, said to make it taller things got even more difficult. Mainly because they wanted this newfound height to be used as a dock for dirigibles. What they didn't know is that it is a little more difficult than just tying up a blimp to a building. They had many obstacles at hand. The architects would have to modify the building because a thousand-foot dirigible moored on the building would add stress to the building. Dirigibles used hydrogen which is extremely flamable, if it were to catch on fire in downtown New York it would be desasterous. Nature poses a threat as well, the winds on  top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivle around. The final obstacle is there is a law that prohibits airships to fly to low in urban areas. In the end the plan failed.",0
"The idea to put a mast on top of the empire building CAPS1 like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, expecially because ""New york city was the lack of Suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to CAPS2 how the mooring mast would never be able to dock drigibles. One reason this could never happen is because CAPS3 of these drigibles contained hydrogen in them wich is highly flammable. ""When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey.... the empire State building realized how much worst that accident could have been."" CAPS3 people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" CAPS4 even if everything was Set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying there dirigibles CAPS4 close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire State building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due violent air currents."" The mooring mast would just be a tottally unstable place to dock these drigibles.",0
"The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story there was depresing nogistalistic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put on emphisis on being strong even though you MONTH1 not enjoy where you are at. Also the author wanted to show the strength of the main of the main character Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world she still wishes to continue pushing foward. This adds more demension the the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward.",0
"Computers are a waste of time! People that say they are helpful are just using that as excuse. Some people say they are good for research and talking to people. Both of these things you can do without a computer. Computers are just a money wasting thing that get in your way of life. People spend hours on computers talking to people. You don't need to do that. You can use a phone instead and call them. After a study they proved that talking on a phone is cheaper then using the computer. In this economy why wouldn't you want to save money while getting the same thing also on a computer you don't really talk to the person you are really just typing word to them. This can be very dangerous. Who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think. Why take the risk when you can just use a phone! Using the computer is like smoking. It is very addicting! People stay on computers for hours every day and don't get exercize. If you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories. This is a huge problem! Obecety is already rising with the number of fast food places and computers are making it worce. And the worst part is parents don't care some children go on the computer for NUM1 hours a day and there parents don't encorige them to go outside. Children need encorigment to get moviing or they will never start, and they will get bigger. We need to form a group to help stop this or before you no it PERCENT1 of the LOCATION1 will be obeise. Another excuse that computer lovers do is they say they are doing research on a country. Even though this MONTH1 be true there are other way you can do this. Why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country. By doing this you will burn calories and get to learn the same stuff you would have on the computer. Also not everything on the internet is true so you might have false information. By getting a book you know it's true. People that love computers will never get away from them over night it MONTH1 take a month or two but if we act new we can make a change and put a stop to it. Computers are a waste of money. You can live without then very easily, and without them the world would be a better place. People are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer. If you are stuck on a computer for NUM1 hours a day you will never have any family memories. All you will remembor is when you were on the computer, and who wants that.",0
"In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. Here is what is.Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because like Narciso says in the bottom of paragraph NUM1, ""In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lifes over entirely, taking what ever work they could find."" CAPS1 of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised into a wonderfly cultural enviorment. An enviorment filled with his ""family"". When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents ""turned the simple house into a home."" This is what the tone of this memoir is.",0
"The mood in this memoir is happyness, love, and warmth. It is to be thankful for what you have and not what you want to have. Narciso was just happy to have such a loving family. Inside of Narciso's home it is very happy loving and warm. I think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing matters as long as you have family. Overall the mood created by the author in the story is love.",0
"I was in NUM1 grade; when it was almost the last day of school so since middle school years have been the lamest years of my life. I thought of my brothers pranks he had done while he was in middle school and one of them that was the funnest was the fire alarm prank. He told me the story to me all the time and that he did it a lot of times and also got away with it. I know I should at least try it since this was my last year in middle school and I should just go for it. well NUM2 days before school was out I had a lighter with me and I had went into the girls bathroom, I noticed there was a alarm on the top of the roof so I stood on top sink and turned on the lighter, waved it around the white round fire alarm and then once I knew it, it went off. My friend was with me at the time I was thinking about it and told her before i did what i was going to do at the time and so she knew what i was about to do. But anyways back to what had happened... We all went outside, me and my friend were laughing so hard that everyone was looking at us with weird faces but then we told our closest friends what I had done and they all cracked up, even some lower grade kids herd about it but that's because they were by us and at the end it didn't get pretty. It was last period and I was in computer class when my vice principal came and got me from class then took me into her room and she asked me if I was the person who turned off the fire alarm and I was like no then asked me again and I still said no. Finally she told me that when I was doing whatever I was doing to make it go off; did I notice if there were people in the stalls at that time? I said no and she told me that there were two people in there and one of them had told on me. So it ended up with me getting in big trouble with being on probation, going to the fire department to apologize for what I had did and how much time it takes for them to do there job on fires at school, then had community service the whole DATE1, and almost didn't get to walk in my promotion with the DATE2 class which got me down. I do regret doing what I had done since I think of it all now, it was something childish and stupid. For some reason it was my funniest moment of my life and I'll always have that as one of my NUM3 top favorite memories and moments of any school year. True Story.",0
"ORGANIZATION1, CAPS1 you CAPS2 want your kids & citizens to get fat and lazy? Or be active, learn everyday skills and become more friendly to life people around you? PERCENT1 of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one. Well I think after reading this those extra PERCENT2 will be persuaded. Now a days NUM1 out of NUM2 people are over weight or obese. This can be causes by lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn CAPS1 go out and exercise an hour a day. This could got their eyes off the computer screen. A great way to help encourage to join a sports team or a club. This can work to people away from screens and the ORGANIZATION2 course. If we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature. Their are great things to CAPS1 at the local park every day. For example you could ride a bike play games or just fool around with friends. Learning could also be a big faster in getting people out of their computer chairs. If they want to look up tell them to use dictionary, theasaurus or a book. If people on the computer but it can be teach kids and drugs. Bt CAPS1 help find carrer options and life. sitting on front of a screen can your health and also. Their are better things to CAPS1. Instead via internet. You can still have fun if you not good at just for instance and friends. If your a boy you could just go CAPS1 like a park and pay carrer base bill or even wrestle. In conclusion I'd say this would want to get up and get outside. Since geting p and side could help you socialize and learn and even loose weight. So now I leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge. But just to fill you if you stay your computer it can promote the need for glasses obesity.",0
"Some people say that computers are fun, smart, and do no harm. Is that true though? Do computers make harm? Well, for one thing, I know that computers can take up! a lot of peoples time. For example, many people don't go outside as much. This is because most people are usually on their computers. What are they doing on the computer you ask; well lets, find out. There are many things a person can do on a computer. It can be fun chatting, educational or hard working. A lot of people use a computer for fun. For example, many people use the computer to chat with their friends. There are many sites to chat with friends. That can usually take up a lot of peoples time. A lot people can talk for hours on the computer and that is what takes up their time instead of going outside. Another example is the games that people are playing.To me, the computer games are one of the biggest problems. This is because a lot of the games can be to much fun, that it can be find a game and play it all the time. This can not only take up their time outside, but it can ruin their life. The game can be so addictive that kids and adults might not get their work done. That can cause failure in school or getting fired at work. On the other side though, a lot of people use a computer for work and school. Beside internet chating and computer games, many people use computers for school and at work. People type their work up or they send work to their e-mail to bring home. This is a good thing about computers, but also a bad thing. It is a good thing because now people can get their work done faster. This is a bad thing because it is another reason to stay inside.For work, people depend on computers. They save work on their and they use computers to build things. For exemple, people use a computer to program a robot. Although they use computers for a good reason people should make time for outside. A lot of people need to take breaks off the computer: because computers can do harm. This is because if they spend all their time on the computer they can get sick. Going outside, exercizing and getting fresh air is very important. So people out there, get off your computer. Stop chatting, pause your game, take a break from your work, and go outside. Enjoy the nature. Most of your day should not be on the computer. Thank you for your time.",0

"I belive that computer technology is a positive effect on people. I think this because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and talk to people online. Here are some reasons why. My first reason is because the computer can teach you how to type faster. For example, for the use of your fast writting you can get a good jobcareer and can have a future in your life. Another example, is because you can type e-mails faster and don't need to type slow. Last example, is that you can improve you typeing skills and become a better typer. My second reason is because you can learn about far away places. For example, you can learn about other countries and how it's different from our country and how their alike. Another example, is you can use it for projects, get all your information and be prepare for a great project. Last example, is you can always learn something everyday from your computer, like news, weather etc. My third reason is because the computer allows you to communicate with other people. For example, you can talk to your friends and family to check in on them and see how their doing. Another example, is when your bored you can always talk to someone on the computer and have fun with it. Last example, is you can talk to your friends and plan when to hang out and go outside and get fresh air, That way you don't have to be in your house all day. That's why I think that computer technology is a good idea because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and allows you to talk to people online. I hope you agree with me also, and should think that computer technology is a good idea for everyday for lots of reasons.",0
"Laughter is a key importance in life, family, and relationships. Gets people through tough times and times when you just need a friend. Laughing is a big part in my life, joking around and having fun, when something happens I try to cover it up with laughter. People MONTH1 say that laughing is to much in situations, but it gets a lot a people trough tough times. CAPS1 there was no laughter in the world in would be dull and I feel that people would be without really experience laughing and making jokes.    Making other people laugh gives me good feeling even CAPS1 it is a lame joke. I think that because it gives me a good feeling about my self, one good thing I know how to do. My family has always been the joking type, messing around and just laughing about everything. There has been a lot of good memories with my family and I, jokes and what not. We enjoy every little laughing matter because its something we each treasure and its a bond that we do not want to loose.One moment in my life where laughter was really great for was in awkward situations with people. My sports team, getting down on ourselves very fast during games and we start to blame other people which is the most common thing that people do when they start to stress in situation like this. Causing so many errors my team mates and I are just not paying to one another and not acting like a team. Just after losing so many games you really start to lose hope for yourself and your team. Our coach always try's to comfort us by saying we did good or we could have tried harder. Some people take this seriously or people do not care and act nothing ever happened and those people start to shut CAPS2 out and only care for their good friend on the team. One morning before we even started things were tense between people. The captain noticed that two of the team members where talking about her and she confronted them saying ""CAPS1 your going to talk about me behind my back just say it to me."" CAPS2 was in complete shock no one knew what to say, so i stated ""well this is just awkward."" The whole team just started to laugh because it loosened CAPS2, even though it didn't totally solve things it just made the situation a little better.Another moment in my life where laughter was a key part was during road trips. Being suck in the car with my family going somewhere and on the way back from were ever we came back it is a lot of bonding time. You start to talk crazy not making an sense, not being like yourself. Then it bring out the fun of messing around then saying something or do something were it become really funny and its a moment that you don't want lost. An example that happened to me on this experience was going to LOCATION1 and making up a lot of inside jokes of things we saw or heard. moments like these I always want to treasure because these people in your life right now will not always be their. To create memories do the basic thing and laugh with family. Laugh with your friends.I believe that in some of these situations it could help loosen some of the tension between people, and sometimes make things a little less weird between people. Just being yourself and dont change that. Having so many of these types of moments and much more are special to me, no matter good or bad. they help me remember things easier. Just having the little moments like these are special and it reminds me of how much I really did care about this one person or realize that a moment wasn't a total lost, because it had the thoughts of people laughing and its something that comforts me.",0
"The mood created by the author was a very grateful and happy mood in his memoir. For an example in paragraph six he states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their Love and sacrifice."" This shows how grateful he is to his parents. He is also grateful to his friends and neighbors it states this in paragraph three when the author says ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that Narciso Rodriguez is very neighborey and that his neighbors portray the same happy, grateful, and neighborely outlook. so all of these reasons explain the mood of Narciso Rodriguez.",0
"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, Winter Hibiscus, in the way that she did. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here is what Saengs mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had becomealmost familiar to her now. Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.

"In the excerpt, The Mooring mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the readers learn that there are obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph NUM1, the readers learn that the architects are worried about the load of the blimp and the wind pressure that is transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The architects would have to strengthen and modify the Empire State Building for it to be accustomed to this new situation. The architects also saw problems with foreign dirigibles which use hydrogen rather than helium as said in paragraph NUM2, ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" One of the biggest obstacle was how the winds on top of the building were always shifting so even if the dirigible is tethered to the mast, the back would still swivel around. Later on, the architects idea for a mooring mast disapperead and it was then used for observation.",0
"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that inside the dirigibles were hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders did not want to risk any lives or damage any buildings. They realized how much worse an accident could be if it took place in down town New York.The greatest obstacle was the wind on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to air currents. Also dirigibles would be dangling over pedestrians on the streets below.The last reason is because their was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for them to tie it up to the building or even approach it.",0

"Censorship is a law and it is commonly broken. You cannot censor any books, movies, music, or magazines. The law of censorship is usually broken in libraries. I feel that censorship affects the writers and school system.     In the US people have the right to expressed their beliefs and feelings on any type of topic that is brought up. Many libraries are taking away the right of that by not allowing certain books to not be read in classes or not allowing the students to watch certain types of movies. I think that this would offend the person whom wrote the book or the writter of the script for a movie. If they librarian doesn't want a certain type of book in her library then she shouldn't have that job or she shouldn't have books at all. Just because she doesn't like the genre of books doesn't mean that somebody else who comes in won't want to read it. If a teacher doesn't want her class to see a movie because it's something that she doesn't like then she shouldn't even show movies at all in her class.      In school we aren't allowed to read about certain topics in the library, because the school system feels that it is bad for us to know about. If we want to learn about something we should be able to. Maybe we don't want to learn about something the teacher is teaching us about. Do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic? Do we take the teacher out of the classroom? No. We show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic. It's respect, we learnt that in kindergarden. I think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us.      Censorship is illegal where we live. But why isn't it taken seriously by the government? I think that they need to realize that what they are allowing is discrimonation to the writer. We get in trouble if we virbally discrimonate somebody. So why are they not doing anything about the physical discrimonation? We should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about. I think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored. It isn't fair to us or the writter.",0
"In the memoir, the mood created CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and cheerful. One example that describes this is from paragraph NUM1. This is where he described his neighborhood, saying ""In our neighberhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" CAPS1 this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other. Also, in paragraph NUM2, the author says that his parents came to LOCATION1 selflessly, to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their home country. Lastly, in paragraph NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memorice of his home, where he had birthdays, parties, and family. He said that there was the scent of life and love in the air. For this he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of ""family.""",0
"CAPS1 is the freedom of speech to be able to read, right and listen to whatever you want but under some conditions.I think that all books should be aloud to stay on the shelf. Like I said as americans we have the freedom to do and say how ever we feel about something without being worried about what will happen. But we should also think about what we are doing and saying and if something is wrong or harms someone. we should take rightfull ownership to our mistakes.But I do agree that some books should be taken off the shelves if they provide thoughts our ideas to cause downfall to our country. such as terrorist groups drug and alachol books should be taken off so we do not pullute the minds of our youth. Our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to the books we read and the television we watch. From these things CAPS1 shows us how to act, dress, feel, and treat other people CAPS1 is the freedom of speech but say the right thing and be careful of what you say because some day CAPS1 could effect you.",0
PERSON1 I think that computers are good for people it helps them find where their for like a good to people and also with 'CAPS1' to show a computer CAPS2 you go to look for a jobs you have experence with computers to get a good paying job to be fliping biggers CAPS2 you got older I know I had I got older I whow to be a starter in life I want to get normal life even than no is normal also the computer is goodis look for like even tell you how it has a five star a NUM1 star you dont want to go to. You rather go to a fire that is whyt a computer is so much more better a computer tells you I have hand good NUM2 for if your is making fingers if pots of people use computers my teachers use computers every day on a regular they look send them into the computers and give them names. What I am doing the cmr's I of my teachers is this computer That is what I think which computers are good for people.,0
but you have a computer at your house. You can use it to find info. You can use the computer to learn how to do something like making somthing and a lot more. You can use the computer after school if you cann't go out and hang with your friends. You can do something with them online. Last things you can ask your friends if there is homework so you don't miss it. So that is why I support advanes in technology.,0
"In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also its a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. Its a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didnt take the old mans advice.",0
"I do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books. People should enjoy reading all types of books. Some people only read different books. Little kids like fantasy and picture books, teenagers like romance, and others like nonfiction. It should not matter what other people think.     If people brought books off the shelves then what will the other people read. Before you bring books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right. Think about what would happen if u brought down books off the shelves. What would happen? I will tell you, you would lose customers.     If you don't want children to read inappropriate books, then you should make a card saying that your parents give them permition to read those books. If that won't work, then make an age limit. Have the parents show you their berth certificate. Have a resticted section in the library. In order to get a book from the resticted section, then have a parent sign a note saying that their allowed.     Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines. If their the age of fourteen and up, then they can get a magazine. Music should not matter to parents, so there should be no problem there. If the movies are bought by the parents, then there should be no problem there either. The other things you can figure it out on your own.     This is what I think should happen to books in a library. I told you how a library should work. I told you what I thought should go on in the library. I will give you some advise. Think before you do. That is all I am going to tell you.",0
"Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way.",0

"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great.",0
"In the story winter hibiscus by Minfong Ho, it tells of a girl who just moved to a new country & is having a hard time adapting to the new land & its people. But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning & you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. This shows that has finally has found comfort & is confident, like the geese going to adapt in a new area, & then will come back, & that the winter hibiscus new gives up & will keep living in the new weather conditions every season.",0
"I strolled into my bedroom, I noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk. I thought that computers are very helpful. There are many controversies on whether computes benefit or do not benefit society. My opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and I support this technology. Computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school. For instance, this year I had a sciences project about how my hobbies interests are related to science. One of my interests in reading, CAPS1 I had to research about how reading a simple back can be related to science. I went on the internet, typed in my question about reading, and two seconds later thousands of results up. I had even gotten some pictures too. A couple of days later after I had handed in my project, I recieved it back. I had gotten a NUM1 on this project! CAPS1 being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science. Without the internet, I probably wouldn't have been able to get on A on this. As you can see, computers can help students with projects, etc. in school. Using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members. In elementary school, my friend PERSON1 had moved away to LOCATION1 CAPS2. I had no way of communicating with her until I found a program on the internet that lets you chat with people. Both of us had been using this and we've been able to talk for on end. I don't see PERSON1 as often as I had used to, but with my computer wide open in my bedroom I can chat online with her almost everyday. Computers can help re-establish old relationships with friends and family. CAPS1 communicating on these are also another benefit. Using computers can help enrich peoples minds. For example, in school we use a program called, ""CAPS3 CAPS4."" CAPS3 CAPS4 involves you playing games that help you CAPS3, and tests when you are ready to take them. CAPS3 CAPS4 has been helping us practice for the ORGANIZATION1's. After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the ORGANIZATION1's and I believe I am going to do well on these tests. As you can tell, the tool of CAPS3 CAPS4 on the computer can benefit your school grades. The effect computers have an people are that they help and benefit the society. I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge. I am clearly in favor of owning and using computers.",0
"In the novel the CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Because in the novel it said ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This quote said that the dirigible would add stress to the building and CAPS2 risk of colapsing.",0
The author concludes the story with this paragraph because wants her to be successful and do good.,0
"I am against that computers benefit society in anyway. Yes computers are a great way to learn about things all over the world, but people have to worry about what is right in front of them. Being on the computer all the time gives less time of exercising, no sight of enjoying nature, and gives less time of interacting with family and friends. Computers don't benefit everyone because it gives less time of exercising. When people don't exercise because they are busy always doing something else less important, then you would always be tired. You won't want to do anything but just sit around & do nothing which calls for laziness you would go weak without exercise. You wouldnt have the strength to eat or lift anything which calls for your bone to go weak and you wouldn't get the calories & calcium & vitamins that your body needs to be strong. You would gain weight which calls for you being out of shape. Since your body has no exercise the weight & fat just stays. Being on the computer doesn't help you enjoy nature the way that you are supposed to. You will never see the world for what it is. You will always miss out on fun activities, then when people start talking about how much fun they had you're going to wish you were there. And you will always be stuck in the house which is going to get boring & there's nothing fun to do. If you're always on the computer cell the time you will never interact with family & friends. That is mostly & always more important than computers because they are always always going to be there for you. You will miss out on fun important occasions with your family because you're so addicted to the computer. And your friends will stop being with you because you're not hanging out with them. Computers really don't benefit everyday people because you miss out on the greater things of life. You will miss out on exercising, nature and especially family and friends. Then you are going to wish that you had spent time with them instead of the computer because you are going to see they had a great time & you would want a great time too!",0
"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement.     I have once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not sutable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things.     If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregancies, drug ussage, and multiple other factors that are effecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these book though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries.     A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is to adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it.",0
"The day was not a fun one. We all just heard really bad news. None of us were even close to smiling. None of us. Even the people that you always see smiling, they had the most serious look on they're face. it was just a bad day. But then one of our friends, PERSON1, had a great idea of going online to find something to cheer us up. It truly was a amazing idea. We spent hours on the computer just sitting there looking up ridiculous videos that we knew about. Trying to make each other laugh. That's when our day started to be a bit better. But it went back down a bit when a few people left to go home. Only three of us were still at LOCATION1's house. PERSON2, PERSON1, and I were all sitting there watching LOCATION2 when a show we all loved came on. Psych. It was a new episode too! what a great day it turned out to be. The show is full of really puny and dumb humor but it fit all three of us. PERSON1 the most. We were all laughing and having a good time. PERSON1 was laughing after the show was over. So we asked what was so funny. He just kept laughing. For five minuets he was laughing. when he finally stopped we asked again. What was so darn funny. then he told us. "" I was laughing at my own laugh. I sound really weird. "" that's when we all started laughing. how could he be laughing at his own laugh. we soon realized how hard it was to stop. it turned out to be a okay day after all of what happened. Now, when ever we are having a bad day. we just bring up that day where we laughed at our selves for ten minuets. And the day is all better.",0

"The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the DATE1 then his water supply wouldve lasted longer and he wouldve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist wouldve died. Luckily though it wasnt and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist couldnt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since Ive fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy.",0
"Being patient CAPS4 a great trait to have. When you are patient you are respected. That CAPS4 why I have alot of respect for CAPS7 teacher. PERSON1. PERSON1 CAPS4 a very patient person. If you didnt understand something she will work through it with you until you understand. Even it takes a couple of weeks. One time she was teaching us how to add negative numbers and I didnt understand and she worked with me until I understood. She was very patient. Let me tell you what happened. CAPS1 class today we are going to add negative numberC CAPS2 CAPS4 going to be a breeze I thought silently to myself. Little did I know I would not know what to do at all and CAPS7 teacher was going to have to be very patient with me. When CAPS7 teacher was done explaining the rules to adding negative numbers I was already lost  CAPS3 are some sample problems that everyone needs to try, said CAPS7 teacher.

"I think people need computers. It helps them see the world if they can't. It can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you. Also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer. So here is examples of these three things. Some people can't physically or mentally and can't afford to travel. Its sad how some people are so sick with a disease or illness that they can't go places. But if they go on the internet they can look up pictures and information of places they've never been to which can help them see the world better. But there are people who can help them see the world better. But there are people who have fears which prevent them from travelling to different places. So thet could go to the internet and find ways to help them get over their fears. Which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places. Then there are people who can't afford it. So the internet can help find a good job that pays good money which they can use to afford to travel the world and see it for what it is. What if you need to send a really important message to someone to prevent them doing something or help them live or even stop a war. So take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding. So if the government figures out what happened and they know how to straightin out the situation then they could send a message to the attackers. What happened and that it wasn't what they thought we did then they would stop fighting and the war would be over. What if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it. So then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives. Sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you can't talk or see them. Someones in the military and heshe has a kid so the computer allows them to see and talk to them through a webcam which would keep the child and parent together and not seperate them. Also you see a friend in facebook who you haven't seen in years so you friend him and you guys get back in touch with each other and you can be friends with them again. So in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things. It can fix relationships, save lives, help you get over fears and see the world. Which isn't bad sure we sometimes go over board with it but it is very useful. It isn't horrible but it is sometimes bad but also sometimes good but",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at first. The most complex obstacle was how the builders were going to securely tie the blimp down without it not only spinning around, but from ripping the building out of its foundation. The constructors also had to worry about if it was safe or not and if it was permitted. Another major obstacle was that not only were the dirigibles too low to the ground to dock, but they were mostly made up of hydrogen instead of helium, which was very flammable. After all the hard work to be successful. Al Smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of the people of New York.",0
"The mood created by the author in this memoir is that be proud and happy of who you are no matter what. One example of this mood being showned in the excerpt is when the family moves into the new apartment. The narrator says that ""My young parents created the traditional Cuban home. Passionate CAPS1 music filled the air. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" This shows the families proudenest of being cuban because even though they are in LOCATION1 now, they didn't forget their cuban traditional of life, food and music.

"The mood created by the author is the mood of appreciation for his house and parents. First, he author talks about how her parents give up what ever they had for them. It says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially..."" This means that their parents gave up their family and friends and jobs in their beloved country, Cuba, just for him and his sister so he appreciate them a lot for doing all of these for them. Secondly his parents showed him the two lessons abot life. The story states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I've often told them the admiration for their strength and perseverance... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. This shows that his parents taught his something important without telling him by showing him. Third, he learned the real definition of family. It says ""It was where I learned the real definition of ""family."" It shows he learned the most important lesson it this house. These is the mood and how it is shown.",0
"Many different things affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a ghost town there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. When the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. With downtown New York being a densely populated area, that wouldn't be such a great idea.Another obstacle they had to face was the weather itself. The Empire State Building was very high so it got really windy. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents.They also weren't thinking about the government when they were building the mooring mast.

"I think censorship in libraries is wrong. Books, movies, and magazines are ment to inlighten, inform, and entertain the reads. If you find something offensive in the book, movie, or even the magazine doesn't mean the next person will. If you don't want your child reading or watching those things, then limit what they watch or read, don't make the people who don't have a problem with what their reading or watching suffur. They have the same right to have those books, movies, and magazines on the shelves as you do!     There has been times when I've wanted a book, but the libaray won't get it because of the adult content in the book. Yet I was raised reading those book, so to me it wasn't adult content. The same goes with the movies, I was allowed to watch rated CAPS1 movies when I was eight years old. Yet movies have ratings that tell you if it's of for a child or adult, like NUM1 to rated CAPS1. The libaray has the same works, a child cannot rent a movie rated CAPS1 without a parent present to get it for them, same goes for a movie theater.     Parent who are worried about their childrens well being, shouldn't make libraries take books, movies, and magazines off the shelves, because of things they find offensive. Other people who pay taxes for those books, movies, and magazines would like to read them as much as the next one, like some libraries bann 'The CAPS4 of PERSON1', because of the way the story is written. Someone found it offensive and gathered a lot of other people, whom didn't read the book but took the word from the person who did, and banned the book. If they had read the book they'd would have understood, it wasn't ment to be offensive, but a fictional story of CAPS4.     I remember living in a town, with a lot of christin people, so the libraries only had christin books. When I went to the libraren and asked for a series of books, and was always turned down, because of the christin population. I told them 'I have as much rights too have those books on the shelve, as they have to have their books on the shelves.' I never got those books, but maybe someday they will look back on those requests and think of way they should have gotten them.     The reason I think censorship is wrong, is because no one should be able to tell people what they should read or watch. When they pay the same taxes everyone does to have those books and movies on the libraries shelves. If you have a problem with what your child watches and reads, than limit what your child reads and watches. Don't take away other people rights to read and watch what they want.",0
"Al Smith and his workers, went through quite a bit while working on this building. As an example, while building it they had to transmitt the stress of the dirigibles load all the way to the buildings foundation, which was around eleven hundred feet below. After that they would have to modify and strengthen the frame of the building to accommodate the new situation. The greatest obstacle throughout the whole process though was the nature itself. Due to violent air currents the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. Safety was a major obstacle Smith had to face while building this building. Smith thought a dirigible would be okay to use on the building but little did he know how dangerous using one could be. Due to the fact most dirigibles from outside the LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, using hydrogen, meant HIGHLY flammable.",0

Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aernt going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying It didnt really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you.",0
"In the passage the author provided a good mood. for example he talked a lot about love, friendship, and other related things. He talked about the differences of a home and house. He made this passage for people to start thinking about what love realy is and what people will realy do for each other. He is a very good author.",0

"Could you live a day without a computer? I talk to my friends everyday on the CAPS1. I learn about current events that I wouldn't know without a computer. A computer also helps me through my daily life. I acknowledge that I should get outside and meet up with my friends, but sometimes when its raining or snowing I just want to talk to them online. Another great thing about talking online is that I can talk to all my friends, not just the one I am playing with. I noticed that even when my friends go away, they can still stay in touch because of their computers. Not only can you stay in touch with your friends, but you can learn about the current events. Whenever I go into CAPS1 CAPS2, my ORGANIZATION1 page comes up and shows me the current events. Without a computer I woudn't be able to see who woll last nights ball game or whats happening with the health care bill. These are important things that help me keep up with things away from my town. A computer also lets me learn mopre about what the healthcare bill actually is and how it affects me. Not only does a computer teach me about current events, it also helps me in my daily life. When I'm eating breakfast, I check my email and look at the weather. During school I type up my essay. When I get home I check the homework and talk to my friends online. All of that is done on a computer. That just goes to show how much I use computers each day. i rely on my computer so much that I would be lost without it and I would get half as much done. I strongly beleive that computers are a necessity. They allow me to talk to my friends when we can't meet up. It keeps me up to date with currents. I think computers have become part of our daily life.",0
ear CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 i think it it good and bad. The good is it teaches people about CAPS1 places and how other people live in there soicty what they do to get food or how they raise there kids. It also help people like cops. Because the have a person there looking for they have the computer to look on. It also help cops as in a speeder they can see it her or she have done it befor. It helps teaches to get a lesson or line to teach or they will put you on line to help you with your typeing. Yes it dose have a positive effect on some people. So people think they do a lot better around the computer or they do there best work online. Like say a high school paper. Yes you can talk to other people online get CAPS1 friends. On the other hand computers can be bad as in you meet people online you don't know who that person is or where they come from. They might have a long crimal. They might be some on want to get you in troble because of his or her family problems. Some people spend to much time on the computer because they meet some one they rally like and don't worry about what the family want to do. So people use to work out every day but now they can talk to they friend all night and all day they stop and forget about it and never start agine. Some people just stay in the and stay on the computer got playing baceball or football or going to family reunions.,0
"In the memoir; ""PERSON1"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood is both happy and sad. This is portrayed happy when he talks about his heritage of being Cuban and having the advantage of being born in LOCATION1. He also is sad though when he talks about how he left his family in cuba to be born in LOCATION1. He likes that his family lives close by in 1970 when his family was allowed to in Cuba for LOCATION1.  He also is very grateful for his parents sacrifice to give CAPS1 the life he has. Allthough liking his neighbrhds he is depresed to be born to a time of racism and segragation like most immagrants faced. This is what the mood was in the memoir of PERSON1 was portrayed as.",0
"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can effect you as a child and when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why.",0
"People can share many things. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would. When I was younger it was the typical older sister LOCATION1 younger sister vibe, frankly we did not like each other at all. Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the DATE3 we were together constantly. We would watchJerry PERSON1, laugh andor make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the showSaturday TIME1 CAPS1, that's where I introduced her to the character ""CAPS2"". PERSON3 and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from ""CAPS2"" and laugh constantly about NUM1 TIME1 CAPS1 is also where we adapted the ""demonic voice"". We would talk to each other, and our friends in these voices. Both of us still talk like that DATE1. As we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on(she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school everything would change though and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then, they always think their the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, I even talked to her and her friends sometime. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of, we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other.  The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to ""move in"" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the TIME1 before, but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. That TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two three weeks. We spend almost every hour of every day together those three weeks, the only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew PERSON3 you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction. Finally she ""moved out"" and I got my room back though I don't think, even now it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; ""Laughter is the best medicine"" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between people"" ""CAPS5 two people in a room, they'll be laughing in NUM2 minutes""; All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well. I am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and I's relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing.",0
"i think that if there are offensive books, music, magazines, etc then they should be put in a section of their own, or the librarians should have them kept up and if someone needswants them then they would have to go to the front dest in order to get them. i think also, if a young child or teenager cant see, read or hear those types of things than they should not be in there period",0
"The mood the author created was gratefulness. Narciso he is grateful for his parents sarrifice to live in LOCATION1. This gave him a better life. The auther writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Also, he admired their strength and perverance of his parents. In the text it says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and preseverance..."" CAPS1, he says that he will never forget how his parents turned a house into a home. That is the mood the author creates in the memoir.",0
"Most dirigibles from outside of U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in LOCATION1, New jersey, On May 6, 1937, the ownes of the Empire state Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken above a densely populated area such as downtown New york.",0
"Computers are a great piece of technology. Computers are great for many reasons. Three of these reasons are pleasure, convienience, and education. I believe that these three reasons are the main reason we use computers today. One reason we use computers is for pleasure. On certain websites, you can talk to friends, see what your friends are doing, you can even video chat with them. Also, you can watch movies, CAPS4 episodes, and videos. In addition, you can listen to music, play games, and check sports scores. I strongly beleive that pleasure is one of the main reasons we use computers today. Another reason why we use computers is convienience. Most people in LOCATION1 have a computer in their home. Computers are convienient because you pay bills on the internet. You email co-workers about jobs. In addition, computers can help people create websites so their their buisness is more noticeable. As you can see, computers are a very convienient piece of technology. The final reason why we use computers is education. On a computer, you can learn just about anything. You can learn about CAPS5 history, sports, you can learn about current events in the world. Computers can help you study, take notes, and helps do your homework. When I have a project, I always use the computer to find important information about the topic. As you can see, education is the most important reason why we use computers. Now, I think you understand how computers are important in LOCATION1's education, pleasure and convienience. I hope you listened to my opinion on computers and I also hope you continue to tell people how great and important computers are.",0
"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso mood in the memoir seemed happy and grate. Narciso's mood sound happy because when he was telling us (readers) about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey and explaining how his house was he was saying how his landlord and daughter nice and how the landlord's daughter was his first friend, and he was also saying how his family and friends were very close. In the neighborhood it was despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity (happiness) and friendship. His mother and father made the house cozy and at the end of the memoir the author said ""I will never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home meaning that he never had a home like the one he lived in now.",0
"In the excerp ""The Mooring Mast"" by ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire state building faced many problems when constructing the dirigibles dock. One is the winds and the safety of the building and people. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents... using the Empire state building was neither practical nor safe."" Another obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegle for the ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" There was also another problem. It was the building's structure and the foundation. The builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast.",0
"Okay, to me, people are way to moral in the modern world, i was taught that if you have a problem keep it to yourself. Most of everyone know that censorship is a big deal but it doesnt have to be. I know that somethings are a little, risque, but getting this our their quicker would be a better solution. Your probably asking yourself, how in the world can this be a 'better solution'? Lets talk about children and this content, if you get this out there quicker and subtlely, the children wont see the need to find out what it is at a later age. If that was to happen the conseqences could be fatal, such as; fines, misdemenors, respect, reputation, and even some time in jail. Tell the kids about murder, drugs, sex, and crimes in general, they are twice as moldable then as they are when they are older. Taking them off our shelves will only make us a nicer community, yea i know what your thinking, why not do that? If more people in your community are nicer, when a real threat comes, whos gonna help? The CAPS1? who knows, it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around, even longer if your in a city. In that time, some one could have died, been robbed and that same criminal gone. So, if we let this stay out on the shelves and so on, people will have the knowledge to see that using these to help people can be benifical. Anyways, what im trying to say is, if you take this away from us, people will become weaker, if you let it stay, people will learn from it and use it for good",0
"I belive that computers benifit our society for many reasons. Computers have been around for many years now and everywere you go you usualy see one. That must meen people love then. These are so many uses and fun expeirences you can have with a computer. Computers make people happy and that makes for a better society because it is happier. they make people happy because you can play games like tetris, CAPS1, and even cards. Compuer games make people happy because when ever they are bored and does nothing going on you can hop on the computer and play a game. Some of the awsome games featured on a computer are CAPS1, cards, pinball and other great game. The computer makes for a happier home because as soon as kids get home from school they use it for games or chat with freinds. Another reason computers benifit society is because you can now pay bills and buy hings from the internet. When you pay bills or buy things over the internet have is no need to go out and waste money on gas so it makes people very happy when hey save money. It also saves on polution because if a car isn't going out there is less so computers are also saving society as well. My last reason that computers benifit society is they can make you smarter and make you do better in school by learning about often people or cultures. For example on my last research project for social studies I used the computer and got an A. this made me happy so in effect it makes society happy. Now you have my reasons why computers benifit the society. They make us happy, made us smarter, and make us a better society for it. I love computers and everybody else should too.",0
I believe that the author concludes  the story with this paragraph because it says that Saeng is confident and is willing to go back and take the test. Saeng feels good about her self and wants to do this.,0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. These obstacles included having to redesign and modify the building structure, the dangers of a dirigible catching fire, the swirling winds, and state law. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (NUM1) This was because the building was not originally built to have that capability. This meant, in order to do this meant over sixty thousand dollars in modification had to be spent. Another obstacle faced was the natural dangers of a dirigible. Dirigibles have a likely chance of catching fire, as displayed by the Hindenburg. If that same accident were to happen over the densely populated area of New CAPS1 it would be a catastrophe. Another obstacle was that the winds up above the building are always swirling rapidly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back the ship would swiveled around, and around the mooring mast"" (NUM2) This would just be dangerous to have something that large spinning round and round. The last obstacle faced by builders was that state law CAPS2 aircraft flying as low as the mooring mast. This would make it illegal for the mooring mast to be used. This probably should have been considered. Overall poor planning created very many obstacles for builders in letting dirigibles dock there.",0
"""CAPS1!"" CAPS2 society today loves laughter. From comical shows to hilarious friends, people have fun convulsing with glee. Not to mention that when you're doubled over with laughter you are getting an amazing workout. Everyone that texts MONTH1 use ""CAPS3"" or ""haha"" to show they think something is funny; but it is nothing compared to actually being with friends and having, ""a smile that burst.""  I couldn't wait. I was on the coast at a camp with my friends, and we were about to head-up to walk up to the three crosses. Some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. One of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter. Because when she tripped, she barely caught herself, as she was about to fall on sleeping CAPS4. Jasmine scurried out the door with the rest of us. After the door was closed, we all doubled over laughing. Jasmine's face, when she tripped was priceless.  We headed into the crisp air without looking back. From a gravel path to the cement road going up the hill, we happily skipped along. As the hill got steeper, we started walking. Jasmine, after being tired from skipping, almost fell again. Everyone started laughing again. The walk up the hill was taking longer than expected. Finally, we could see the three crosses at the top.  When we arrived at the crosses, we waited for the miraculous sunrise. We kept staring at the ocean; waiting with anticipation. Eventually, CAPS5 pointed out that the sun rises on the east and would we coming over the mountains. Again, all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which side the sun rose on. At last, the astonishing sunrise happened. It was full of pink, purples, yellows and oranges. After watching the sunrise we realized we still had the treacherous walk back down the hill. I peered over the edge and saw a little path. With a bunch of convincing, I got all the girls to walk down the steep hill because it looked shorter than the cement road we came up.  The first part of the path was simple. As we started heading farther down the hill it got skinnier with more brush. A couple of the girls thought we should head back up, but I convinced them otherwise. So on we went. ""CAPS6 no!"" CAPS7 yelled. We turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush. She had just gotten her shoes the day before and now they are muddy and lost. Everyone was trying to reach it, but it was just a little too far away. Suddenly, PERSON1 tried to grab the shoe; immediately she fell into the blackberry bush! PERSON2 forgot about her shoe for a little and started doubled over with laughter again. While flailing and screaming we yelled for her to stop because if I didn't mention this earlier; this is a very steep hill. While she was in the bush, she grabbed PERSON2's shoe. The hard part was getting PERSON1 out.  The first time we tried to pull her up; we got her up a couple of inches then she fell back down, into the bush. Finally, after what felt like a million tries, we pulled her big butt out of the bush. Everyone was laughing so hard during the extravaganza. PERSON1 was super embarrassed. After all of that, we headed down the hill. We still had giggles while trotting down the trail. As we went, we saw animal tracks. We then realized the trail was most likely made by animal. A couple girls joked around about being terrified of the animal tracks. Eventually, we got back to the cabin, still laughing about what had taken place. The rest of the day everyone was happy and giggly for waking up with an amazing morning.  Laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day. Laughter helped us work through the mud, the shoe losing, and the cold. With out it, we could have been very grumpy. Also, having amazing friends to laugh with was phenomenal. Laughing helps people be happy; being happy is better than being sad; therefore, laughter is important. When writing this paper to the ORGANIZATION1's in LOCATION1, I told my friends about the adventure we went on and the predicament we got ourselves into. They laughed hysterically, since they knew the girls. Laugh often to be happy.",0
"Have CAPS3 ever had that one moment with some that CAPS3'll remember forever and laugh about every time CAPS3 think about CAPS2.? CAPS8 I have and I think that everyone should have a moment of laughter in there life. On the day of DATE1 was the day that I will laugh about for the rest of my life. On this day my boyfriend PERSON1 from LOCATION1 decided that CAPS1 wanted to take me out to an early breakfast. CAPS1 called me around four in the morning saying that CAPS1 was starving and that CAPS1 needed some food in his stomach. So CAPS1 picked me up around five am and we went to ORGANIZATION1. We sat there drank coffee and ate pancakes. We finished very early so PERSON1 wanted to go for a drive, let me remind CAPS3 CAPS1's from LOCATION1 so CAPS1 has CAPS6 clue where anything is in LOCATION2. So as we head out of town I am giving him directions to where the best place is to go for a drive. We are in his DATE2 poniac which is not the greatest vehicle to be going for a ride in around this town, because around here CAPS3 need a four wheel drive vehicle otherwise CAPS3're probably going to get stuck where ever CAPS3 go. We were doing great at first because we stayed on the pavement roads, but PERSON1 wanted to explore the gravel roads. So we started to go down a gravel road and we both decided that maybe CAPS2 was time to go home. When we came up to another road CAPS1 decided CAPS1 was going to turn around. That was not the greatest idea. CAPS1 seen the sign for the street but CAPS1 turned the wrong way into a field. CAPS2 was okay, CAPS8 as first CAPS2 was . Until CAPS1 went to back up, and the car wouldn't move. I looked at him and laughed and said ""I told CAPS3 that CAPS3 needed to go right not left."" CAPS1 then looked at me and said, ""CAPS2's not stuck I just need to try a little more, and we'll be out."" One thing that PERSON1 did not know is that CAPS2 had been warm in LOCATION2 the last couple of days, so all the fields were very wet and soft. I looked at him and told him that CAPS1 might not want to CAPS5 that but CAPS1 said that is was fine CAPS1's done this before. So I got out of the car and went and stood by the road. PERSON1 tried to get the car out of the mud for at least ten minutes, and that was not the greatest thing to CAPS5, because now the tires were berried under the mud. I started to laugh so hard because CAPS1 got out of the car and looked at me and said I should have listened. PERSON1 had one more thing that CAPS1 wanted to try, because CAPS6 offense but CAPS1's a boy and they can CAPS5 everything themselves. So CAPS1 told me to get into the car and put CAPS2 in reverse so I did as CAPS1 said, then CAPS1 said okay lightly push on the gas as I push, CAPS8 I did a little more then lightly push on the gas. I looked up and PERSON1 was covered in mud from head to toe. CAPS2 was the greatest thing I have seen in my life, my boyfriend had got what CAPS1 deserved because CAPS1 wouldn't listen to me. I looked at him and my eyes instantly started to water, I was trying to hold my laugh in, but CAPS2 just wasn't working. I started to laugh and CAPS1 looked at me and said, ""CAPS3 think this is funny?"" CAPS1 then pulled me out of the car and shut the door and started to wipe mud all over my face, I was laughing so hard that i fell and took him down with me right into the mud. CAPS8 to make the story even better, we went to go open the doors to the car, and CAPS3 remember how I told CAPS3 that I put the car in reverse CAPS8 when CAPS1 pulled me out i didn't take CAPS2 out of reverse, and his car locks when its not in park. I then looked at him and said, "" CAPS5 CAPS3 have an extra key on CAPS3 by chance?"" ""CAPS6"", CAPS1 said, ""CAPS7?"" I looked at him and said, ""CAPS8 lets see the car is still running, the windows are up, our phones are still in the car, and CAPS8 to finish CAPS2 off the doors are locked."" CAPS1 looked at me and his mouth dropped. We sat there waiting for almost an hour and a half before anyone came down the road. CAPS2 took use about forty-three minutes to get the doors unlocked, and then CAPS2 took us about thirty minutes to get CAPS2 unstuck. When I got home I told my family the story, and we still laugh about CAPS2 to this day.",0
"ORGANIZATION2. A computer is a very helpful resource. It helps people navagate through life, they can find jobs, do research for school. This world wold be nothing without computers. But on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer. But surfing the web for countless hours is their choice. Computers can help students do research from the comfort of their own home. Instead of going to the local library and looking and looking for books, all they have to do is type in thier research topic and wallah tons of different websites are right under their noses. A computer is the world at your finger tips. Also a computer can help unemployed people find a job. Its easy, type in what city you want to work in, and there you go. You can even fill out a job application right then and there. Hey, some people even work from home. Stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes. Also working from home can a lot less tessful. It's less stressful because you dont have to deal with annoying and impatiant co. workers. Did you know that PERCENT1 of employment is from the workers home, CAPS1 now you know. Working from home makes another day at the office, another day at home. Computers have helped us come along way since caveman times. Without computers this would will be nothing. We woulde have so many basic things like stoplights, elevators, and even bleders. We also wouldn't have the more sifisticated things like fockets. and cars and planes. Imagine an airport without computers, where would they store all of their information? On paper? Where would a school store all their grades and tardys? On paper? Where would the goverment store their information? On paper? With those three palces we already cut down half of the ORGANIZATION1. Computer help the environment too. They will also help us to invent more technology so that one day we can live on CAPS2 or something. I hope this essay changed your mind about computers. Lets recap they help students reasearch, help people find jobs, you can work from home. Helps the environment. Without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like caveman. The CAPS3 line is that computers are very helpful.",0

"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a variety of different moods CAPS2 the memoir. In paragraph two the author tells how much culture was put into his home ""my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" CAPS1 also tells how thankful CAPS1 is that his parents instilled him a love of cooking and Cuban music. This gives you a feeling of the home being warm comfortable and most of all alive. In paragraph three the athor tells how  a family has nothing to do with blood relatives. ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" CAPS2 out the memoir you really start to see the authors opinion of the definition of home and family. In paragraph six you see how grateful the author is towards his parents, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It gives a mood of greatfulnes. In paragraph three and four the author talks about the sense of unity and how his parents would always have their door open to people in need and how the whole community was like a family ""cultures came together a great solidarity and friendship."" ""My parents always kept their arms and door open to many people we considered family..."" The general mood of this is all the moods coming together to creat a generas senseof home and community.",0
The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.,0
"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood set by the author is thankful. We can tell the author is thankful because, she says that she is thankful that her parents left Cuba for her to have a life in LOCATION1. In paragraph five he says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their childern a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" In paragraph six she says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This is another example showing that she is thankful. A third example is also in paragraph six when the author says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This is saying that this person is thankful for the sacrifices and that they can not tell they're parents enough. In conclusion, from the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood that we can conclude is given off is that they are thankful for what they're parents have done for them.",0
Why the author concluded with this paragraph was because it showed a restated the main idea of the story and the readers understood what the story was about. That is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.,0
"Regardless of if we are speaking of the religous demanding books such as the CAPS1 CAPS2 series to be ripped from our shelves or CAPS3 wanting to burn the LOCATION1, books can always bring about controversy. In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so.     Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writers words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future.      Imagine the impact if the CAPS4 had locked away every copy of the CAPS5 because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of CAPS6 or CAPS7. It would be a would far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place.     While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading 'ORGANIZATION1', they definantly should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music MONTH1 have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they MONTH1 speak a message. To a creationist PERSON1's views MONTH1 seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they MONTH1 be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own.      We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others. Censorship is wrong, our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another.",0

""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country"". This was the mood created by the author in the memoir.",0

"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in paragraph NUM1 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though they were largely ignored. All those obstacles eventually lead to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or feasible.",0
"The architects of the Empire State Building faced many safety & practical obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on top of it. For example, dirigibles outside of the LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Furthermore, anchoring a NUM1 foot dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem, the architects would have to make MONEY1 in modifications to the building's steel frame. Additionally, there are violent & unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible. Clearly, there were practical & safety reasons why the dirigible moor was unable to be completed at the top of the Empire State Building.",0
"Currently, there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. Some people, say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. However, I tend to believe that the computer is not necessary. People exploit most of their time on comptuers, reducing their exercise time. Not many pay attention to nature, and instead of talking to friends in the internet, why not meet them at the park? Many people who use their computers reducing their metabolism. This is one reason why the LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates in the world. In addition, the less you exercise, the less healthy you will be, and the more pair you'll recieve, you will feel more tense if your muscles are not exercise. If we, as CAPS1, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many possibilities for us in the future. Isn't it difficult to know that people pay too much attention to the computer when there are endangered species in nature? Pandas! polar bears, whales of different types, and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem. Unfortunately, we pay much of our attention on the computer, with consideration, as humans, we make things possible, so we should help creatures in need to survive for generations. Perhaps we MONTH1 learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so. Perhaps we will find nature more interesting. Why do we have text messaging in our computers if we have the ability to talk to our frinds in a park? We have the freedom of speech in the LOCATION1. Our families need help occasionally, but sometime we're not available. While reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming more important, and are distracting what's mos important. In conclusion, computers hours, you must think about what can be done for nature, for your health, and for your family and friends.",0

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that shell hopefully be stronger. By that I mean shell feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didnt get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.,0
"Should books,music,magazines, etc., be removed form shelves that are found offensive? Everyone has their own oppion on that question. In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable. I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it.      Personaly i don't think anything should be removed from the shelves. While growning up our parents try to keep us from things, at that point in life don't need to see. I can agree with age limit but you can't hide everything. Isn't it best to let the children know whats out there before you just letting them go to find out on there own?     You would probably get multiple answers to that question. My personal views MONTH1 be different from the person sitting bestide me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and litsen to what you want. The world is not a safe place, its scary and mean to the people. When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certin things that they wont know and wont see. But thats just part of raising your kids, when they get older and start asking quesions i'm going to answer with the truth.     Is keeping these things from our children lying to them? I would have to say yes to that question. By taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong. Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived. Still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself.     To conclude my oppion I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't, not let anyone see it and them and then let them out in the world, and have a complete culture shock. Teach your children whats out there, let them know the truth about the world. Should certain materials be removed from shelves? No, CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear?",0
The mood created by the author in the memoir was good. Her memoir was good because in 1961 they moved to a simple house only for two-familys. with blond-bricks building in the ironbound in LOCATION1. She also had a good mood because she had her first birthday in the arrival of the country.,0
"No I as an CAPS1 cetazine do not feel that any materials should be removed. There are many reason I feel this way and I hope that after people have read this they will agree with me. THere are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below.      First and for most is the fact that this is LOCATION1. LOCATION1 is suposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least thats what the national anthem tells me. So to me if some one removes a book or movie from a library becasue they find it offencive they are trying to take away one of my right as an CAPS1 cetacine. The right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom. I should be free to be able to walk into a library and grab any book i wish. I should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie a choose from the shelf. If they put a movie or book away if they make it to were i can't get to it then they are messing with my freedom, and this is somthing i can't stand as an CAPS1. I should be free to read or watch what ever i choose to.     Which brings me to my next point. This point is a simple and logical one. My second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie. Just because it is there it does not meen that they have to read or watch it. If someone doesn't like a book good for them don't read it. If someone doesn't like a movie good for them don't watch it. It is rather quit simple in my opinion if someone doesn't like said book or movie then just leave it alone and don't mess with it. They shouldn't have the right to ruin it for everone else. Just because one or two or even twenty people find a book offencive doesn't mean they have the right to remove it. There MONTH1 five million other people out their who love said book so why ruin for everyone just to make a few people happy. They do have the right to say no and not read or watch the movie, but they don't have the right to say i can't.     Finaly people say that said book or movie should be removed because a child might get it and it is not apropreat for children. Well to that I have to say it is the parents job to make sure a child is not readind or watching something they shouldn't. If i child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents job to tell them to put it back. People don't have the right to completly remove said book or movie just because a kid might get it.      So there is my opinion on this little matter. I don't feel that libraries should be censored. I feel we all have the right o make own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch what ever we choose. It is not fair to get ride of a book just because a few people don't like it. Hundreds of othes might love it, and like I said before if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book then don't read it or watch it. Don't ruin it for everyone else though.",0

"A book represents a person's beliefs and feelngs about a topic. Therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech. I do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it MONTH1 be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again. A person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it. If we do not accept other people beliefs, we are just as prejudice as the books we are trying to censor.      Many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the holocaust. I think we have the right to know about important events. For one reason, if we forget about such things, than they are more likely to be repeated. Do we really want the murder of millions of people to be repeated? Just becaused we are ashamed of something dosen't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to stike again like a hungry alligator. Instead books about prejudice events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act.     While some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people MONTH1 find it offensive. There is a much easier solution that censoring those books. The offended groups should just ignore the book. If it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it. The book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast. It should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can.     The main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds in offensive. However, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive? To CAPS1 A CAPS2 is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly. If that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others. Another big target for censorship in some countries is the CAPS3. Censoring that book would basically tell the CAPS4 population that they are wrong.     Censoring something is wrong. Not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book. While some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties. The simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decid if they should read it, or not.",0
"in the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there were many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One of the problems was that a huge dirigible held the top of the building held by a single cable would have stressed to the rest of the building. in order to make the tower half of the building more stable they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars on modifications CAPS1 nature was a key issue the winds were unpredictable because of violent air currents and even if the dirigibles were tied to the mast, the back would swivel around CAPS2 large dirigibles dangling above pedestrians was not safe. Another reason as to why dirigibles could not be docked at the top of the Empire State Building was because there was a law not allowing airships to fly so low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever dock ships there. overall, these were some of the obstacles faced well building the Empire State Building",0
"In this excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, PERSON1  talks about the true meaning of ""family"" and the mood of gratitude is established.""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this passage, PERSON2 is establishing his gratitude for the cultures of his family. He is grateful for the food and music that has wound its way into his present day life.My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This quote explains how much PERSON1's parents sacrificed for his happiness. They left behind everything and everyone they loved, basically a huge chunk of them, and for that, he is extremely grateful.",0

"One day, a day before the party for my brother's DATE1 to be exact. We were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because that's were the boy's will be hanging out and sleeping. My cousin PERSON4 and I were helping mom and the boy's that were already here and their names would be PERSON5 , CAPS1 and CAPS2. PERSON6 was already here of course because he's the DATE1 boy.

The best part of today is that we get to hang out with the boy's. When PERSON4 and I got into the living room everybody was in the kitchen and partly in the living room. TIME1 that TIME1 the boy's thought CAPS7 would be fun if they played cops and rubbers. The apartment was the jail. PERSON2 , CAPS2 , PERSON6 were the cops and PERSON5 and CAPS1 were the rubbers. PERSON4 and I wanted to play so we went outside and ran into PERSON5 on the otter side of the apartment , he was the only one who knew we were outside. When I was running to hide behind the trees I felling in the hole that turns off the water for the apartment and my leg looked like cottage cheese and CAPS7 was gushing blood and you could see my bone. I had to stop playing for the TIME1. Mom told PERSON4 and I to go to bed.  The next mourning mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said ""yes"". I crawled out of bed because I needed to go to the bathroom so PERSON4 helped me up the stairs and when we were coming down the stairs PERSON5 saw me hurting and being the amazing boyfriend he is he picked me up and carried me to the couch in the living room and sat me down on the couch and kissed the top of my head and said ""good mourning beautiful"" and I said ""good mourning to you to baby"". Now everybody is standing around for their food to be done. The boy's are making pizza if you wanted to know. Then my little sister CAPS6 walked in to the kitchen and said ""ma'am I want a cookie"" and mom said "" okay , here you go baby"". CAPS6 ran off with a very big smile on her face. The boy's got their pizza now and they just went back to the apartment. PERSON4 and I looked at mom and said ""wow"" mom's like i know. We all laughed and started talking about boy's and friends , family , animals. CAPS7 was a very fun weekend and even though I got hurt we still made the best of CAPS7. Even though I got hurt and cant do anything for the next two months or so , we still had a blast with each other and PERSON6 said "" CAPS7 was his most favorite DATE1 he's ever had so far . CAPS6 wanted her friend to come over but she had fun with mom and PERSON4 , the boy's when they came in the house and I.

"The question is whether or not people are spending too much time on the computer or not. In my opinion people arent, and there are many benefits from being on the computer. Typing in the computer teacher hand-eye coordination. It is easy to learn while on computer too, and you all communicate with people also! Handeye coordination is very important. We use it everyday during sports taking notes, even playing video games! Being on the computer is good because it develops hand-eye coordination. Whatever you do on the computer typing, playing online game, or surfing the web develop hand-eye coordination.

"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Obstacles they faced were the strength of the framework, Safety of the dirigibles, CAPS1 nature, and a law. The first obstacle, framework, wasn't too hard overcome, it cost MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. By using led weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe hanging high above pedestrians. The final and forth obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to even attempt docking to the mast.",0

"The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building aced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, structural problems, breaking laws, and keeping the dirigible safe in the air.  The structural problems this would have caused was the pressure on the buildings foundation from being pulled by the dirigibles.  The builders were also breaking The Law because there is a law saying how low an airship can fly over an urban area, the dirigibles would be way too low.  The final obstacle for the builders was to keep the dirigible safe in the air.  This is due to the high winds the airship would be swinging around and could break off.  Another issue would be if it blew up the pieces would fall onto downtown New York City.",0
"LAUGHTER CAPS1 knows that laughter is a healing medicine. It has the power to ease a lot of aches and pains, such as the hole in someone's heart after a breakup or the suffering of someone unable to provide for their family. However, the kind of aches laughter eased in my life was the pain from the loss of a dear friend and teacher. Recently, one of the best teachers I've gotten the chance to know passed away. He was trying to get into the ORGANIZATION1 to set up his lesson plans for the TIME1, when the fatal incident happened. <NUM1<CAPS2> had a doctor's appointment that day and had gotten a substitute to take his place. It was six o'clock in the TIME1 and still dark out as PERSON2 tried to open the doors of the ORGANIZATION1. Before he knew it, he was down on the ground waiting for someone to come help. Eventually, PERSON1, the janitor, came out, spotted him and quickly called NUM2. The ambulance hustled to come pick him up and rushed him to the hospital for emergency care. As soon as they got there, they found out he had had a heart attack. He'd had a couple minor ones before this one. However, this heart attack was big. It took his life and they weren't able to revive him. PERSON2 was pronounced dead on the day of DATE1.  Our principle called for an emergency assembly when we all had arrived at ORGANIZATION1 that TIME1. We had known something was wrong, considering the strange looks on all of our teachers' faces. All the students gathered together in the small gym of our ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION1. The air was filled with anticipation as we waited for something to happen. After a bit, a man we all knew walked out in front of us with a microphone in his hand. With slumped shoulders and a grim face, PERSON3, our principle, told us of the tragic news. My mouth fell open and I gasped. I could hear people adjusting in their seats and murmuring among themselves as they struggled to take in the devastating news. Looking around, I saw the same shocked expressions on CAPS1 of my classmates' faces. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't just yet. PERSON3 explained the situation further as we intently listened to the sickening words coming out of his mouth. I was in shock. I didn't believe that PERSON2 was gone.  After our principle was finished speaking, we were ushered out of the gym by melancholy teachers and told to report to our first period class. As I made my way to my locker, I heard sobbing, but it was mostly silent. I quickly grabbed the folder for my first class and closed the locker, wanting to get out of the hallway and into a more private area. Walking into the classroom, I sat at my desk. People in my class filed in through the door and took their seats as well. Our teacher for that class didn't talk to us, so we presumed we weren't doing anything. Sitting there in silence and feeling helpless I put my head down on my desk and started to cry. It really happened, I thought to myself. The reality of the TIME1 was setting in.  By the end of first period, the sleeve of my sweatshirt was drenched in tears and mascara. Nobody had really said anything, but that was okay. Seeing that I had been crying, people stopped to hug me as I sluggishly walked down the hallway to my second period class. I expected my next class to be a lot like the first, but it wasn't. In place of the cold silence, was the soft sound of music. Instead of crying by themselves, people were being comforted by friends. Students were making cards for PERSON2's family. We were all reminiscing the good times we had with PERSON2. We retold the stories he told us of his life in the classes he taught. We remembered the funny crack he would get in his voice when he raised it in even the slightest way. We laughed when we remembered how he couldn't hang up anything straight and that the evidence was on his classroom walls. For the first time in that already long day, we felt alright. We felt as if we could celebrate his life, not mourn it.  The rest of the day was alright. Not because we lost a great teacher, but because we could love and appreciate a great teacher. Laughter eased the pain and sorrow of that dreadful day. We could remember and laugh about the good times we had in the classroom with him throughout our CAPS3. ORGANIZATION1 and ORGANIZATION1 years. We could remember the man PERSON2 was through the small tickle in our bellies. Laughter brought us together in a time of need.",0
"I strongly disagree.I think that materials should don't  be removed from the library.CAPS1 all the materials are part of the library and for the school and for us too.All the materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, cd's. should don't be removed from the library.I got my own reasons that materials should don't be remove from the shelf. like sometimes i don't found any interesting things to do, so i go to my tiny library that i got in my house and i pick any book that i like.But when i don't like or i don't find any interesting book in my house, i go to the library to find  some intresting  books.But when the libraries or the school got offensive books, magazines, movies, ect., i think that offensive stuff shoul be remove from the library,CAPS1 is not good for the children's, like when they want to read a book, like cartoon or animal book, and they don't find what they want they are going to get mad. And what about the parents the parents if they need to found some information about a book, or they just wanted to read and they found offensive stuff, the parents are going to get mad, not all the parents right but some parent will.and they maybe are not going to came back again.I never experience something like this in my life CAPS1 in my school and the library that i go they don't have anything offensive or inapropiated. that's why a respect the people for the library and for the school, CAPS1 they respec us too. tha's why i never go to places that i don't know.Supose i go to a library that i don't know and i bring my parent and my little brother right and this library have offensive materials, my parents are going to get mad with me, they are going to said that if i don't have respec, and that i bring my brother to a innapropiated place they are going to be mad with me, that i bring my family to a offensive place, and is not my foul right.And those are my opinions why",0

"In ""Narciso Rodriguez from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" there is a proud, happy mood. This memoir is all about heritage and the home. When he talks about his heritage he speaks about his food, home, and music that gives the reader a sense of pride. This is also a happy sort of memoir because it talks about the unity of the neighborhood despite the fact that they are all from different parts of the world,",0
"Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you dont. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at PERSON2 and PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly CAPS2 happened that night I regret. PERSON3, PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldnt stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over stiff upper lip. I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didnt work tears rolled faster than CAPS1 falls. I want to go home I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin PERSON1, who was babysitting. CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said CAPS2 all grouchy. I had sniffled and said I want to come home, I miss you. and sniffled more. Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready. CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told PERSON3 and PERSON6 as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was PERSON5, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in LOCATION1s car. CAPS4 didnt you want to stay? PERSON5 asked calmly. I dont know. And it wasnt brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks.",0
"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the story has more of a  ""happy"" or ""joyful"" mood.  I chose those moods because one, it showed how peaceful and loving everyone was even if they weren't family, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Two, he said how happy he was for his unselfish parents, ""I was always greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more couragous thing than I could have ever done"". Finally, he explains how different everyone was, and yet can get along with each other so well, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" In conclusion, this is the mood I think the author created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez.",0
"Patience is something you have to work on I do not have a lot of patience, I do not like waiting at all it is not fun .I do not like waiting ,because being patient is boring and five CAPS2 feels like twenty CAPS2.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. To prevent this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified in strengthened and to accommodate this new situation. Secondly, most dirigibles from outside of the LOCATION3 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners realized that if one of the hydrogen dirigibles were to catch fire just like the Hindenburg did in Lakehurst, LOCATION4, the accident could be much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle that the builders were faced with was violent air currents while the dirigible was tethered. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to winds in using lead weights to weight the back down, where they would be dangling above pedestrians would neither be practical nor safe. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.",0
"Many families across the globe use computers, whether their from LOCATION1, all the way to the deserts of LOCATION2. However, believe that being on a computer can negative effects to you like lack of exercise, In CAPS21 perspective. I can agree, with there, but I truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly. With computer on CAPS21 side, I believe there are many positive effects towards computers, such as: there are many things to do, you can from the internet, and it is very entertaining. If you have a computer, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. For example, I know of many online colleges. Ever heard of the commecial, ""CAPS1 in your CAPS2's?"" that is where students can got their CAPS3.E.D and have a succesful carreer. Not only that, you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online. There are many shopping sites online, such as ORGANIZATION1. Furthermore, many shops like CAPS4 CAPS5 have a catolog online, where you and effenly. Lastly, if you have close relatives or friends that live far away, there are many options today like CAPS6, (CAPS7 CAPS8 CAPS9). Webcam programs like which you see and talk to each other using a webcam and CAPS10, where you can find your friends and check how their doing daily. These are all good reasons why computers are sucess in the economy. Some computers are used for entertainment. Online there are many CAPS16 you can play, like CAPS11's (CAPS12 CAPS13 Online CAPS14-CAPS15 CAPS16) I play many of these, including CAPS16 such as CAPS17. I love these CAPS16 because they are very amusing world. You watch many of your favorite movies watch funny obeses on the internet via CAPS18. CAPS18 is a world-wide used source where you can watch or upload videos so the world can see. A CAPS18 video is ""CAPS19 CAPS20 CAPS21 CAPS22,"" a young boy gets bitten by his younger brother. This entertainment system is also a great way to use up time lik if you're bored. I can see how people be to it, but you just need to use it wisely and make a plan to use the computer maybe an hour a day. A computer also has many great sources you can learn from, like an online website that has fun CAPS16 called CAPS23. With this, you can play many fun CAPS16 while learning about interesting facts about science. In CAPS21 science class, we use this websites many times, to us learn about motiongravity. You can also conduct research on the web, you with many projects. I know I use the web to with almost every project I have.",0

"All of the memories that I've shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion. Usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness, just enjoying life and being teenagers. But on the other hand, sometimes these memories are tinged with sadness: day-to-day frustrations, vital playoff games that we've lost by small margins, or the passing of important people in our lives. I think that these highs and lows are remembered most in our minds because they are accompanied by things that are auditory (laughing and crying) and our brains recognize them as being more important than a typical day. As children we're very impressionable, so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad, it's going to have an effect on us and be remembered.  I think it's known by everyone that teenagers aren't necessarily the most logical thinkers. Some people speculate that it is genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we reach our teen years we will make a few silly decisions and possibly get into a small amount of trouble. I'll speak for my generation when I say that our actions aren't always completely thought out and sometimes we simply don't have a reason to explain the strange things that we do. For instance, my friend PERSON1 has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times. She washes it on multiple occasions throughout the month, and is convinced that driving slower helps to keep the dirt and debris from her mile-long gravel drive away from the candy-apple red paint on her ORGANIZATION1. This wouldn't bother me, except that every day after school I go to her house along with our other friends, CAPS1 and PERSON2, to kill time before practice. The group is always anxious to get away from school because we're tired, hungry, and just want to get to her house and relax, but PERSON1 never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at turtle speed. One day, PERSON2 became fed up and said that she could probably run faster than PERSON1 was driving. PERSON1 decided to take her up on the offer, stopped her car, and PERSON2 proceeded to get out and jog down the driveway alongside the car. Soon she was a good distance ahead of us, dancing and skipping toward our destination. However, she soon changed her mind and since the car was going slow enough, she climbed on the hood and we continued driving, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from LOCATION1's house, just one small bend before we'd be there, when PERSON1 realized that if her grandparents, who live right next door, saw us, then she'd be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway. PERSON2 slid off the hood, granted we were only going about eight miles an hour, and momentum pushed her forward at a trot. She slid on the gravel road, landed on her rear, skipped across the ground, and then stopped.  Those of us who had remained in the car were in shock, our mouths agape, and we stared at her for the few seconds she remained sitting. She then stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysteric laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well, remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes. All of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight, we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day, and told all of our other friends about it.  We had realized that it was a stupid thing to do, and PERSON2 could have been hurt. But she wasn't, and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has that ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain, ""CAPS2, I'm having fun."" CAPS3 crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want those around you to recognize it. I really enjoy my memories that involve laughter, and when I think of those memories I always laugh again. I think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life. You don't have to spend money or drive somewhere, there's virtually no expense. It's timeless, simple, fun.",0

"Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isnt just waiting a long time, its being respectfull and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectfull and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. If your at school and need to go to the bathroom wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if heshe is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when their talking.

"The thought of seeing him and hearing his laugh never failed to make me smile. I was beginning to accept the fact that this was an urge I couldn't fight anymore. His sense of humor was the best I had encountered and it made my heart run wild. To me, the best piece of a relationship is learning about one another and exploring the little things that make that person who they are. A trait I always search for is someones humor and when I can easily find it, I thrive on it. My story takes place nearly a year ago, while my freshmen school year was coming to an end. I had a suitcase of new memories I planned to carry with with me, but one more was still to be added. I strolled into art class merely NUM1 seconds late on a particularly average day. The musty smell of rain and old paint settled in the air, something I had come accustom to. Instinct told me to take my seat, so with my headphones blocking the rest of the world out, I did. I paused my music to allow my surroundings to come into focus. A voice with a highly sarcastic tone came from in front of me. ""CAPS1 to go! You're late."" CAPS2 the teacher had moved all of our seats, I couldn't help but to laugh at myself as well. However, my seat remained unchanged, the only new aspect was the people sitting around me. I greeted the familiar faces with a smile as class began.  The teacher went on about art related topics that I was far beyond, so by habit I vaguely payed any attention. I was far more focused on the person sitting in front of me. I had never talked to this boy but there was something very intriguing about him. We barley said a few words on that day of class. As the next day approached, I continued my usual pattern of entering the room and sitting in the same place. It had slipped my mind that a stranger was going to sit in front of me. He turned into the room took his seat. CAPS2 what I had forgotten made me excited. Today was a free work day, a time to be social and work at our own pace. Perfect opportunity for me to learn something not related to art. I casually introduced myself, trying to fit personality into my words. His introduction was far less enthusiastic. Him being uninterested made me thrive to try harder. I began to be myself and act as if I had known him for years, even though his name was brand new to me. It was then I had caught his interest and the conversations started flowing. By the end of that day I hadn't finished any of the work I was supposed to have, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had just met such an alluring new person.  Each day went on similarly but I had taught myself a good balance of work and talk. I couldn't get enough of this person I had just let into my life. Everything he said interested me and each word pulled me in. I'm positive everyone in the room knew of how funny I found him because of how often my laughter filled the room. It didn't take long for me to become very attached to him and each hysterical thing he said. After a couple weeks, the hour of class wasn't enough for us, and he made the decision to give me a call. I intrigued him as well. So our time spent talking didn't stop at the end of the school day but spilled over into our phone conversations. More time passed and it became a usual thing to talk with him often. I no longer needed to act as if I had known him for years. It was well over a month and a half into our relationship when comfort was starting to set in for me. Although, along with familiarity came a sense of question. I was beginning to very well open up to him but was not getting the same in return. I would tell him something of my past and he would make a joke of it; I would explain an opinion of mine and he would pretend to have the same. I had never laughed so much in such a short amount of days, but it was coming time to feel more then pretend hysteria. I wanted to be able to tell him personal things, but get something from him too. I began to realize I was digging deep into shallow waters.  The amount of laughter in this relationship of mine was clouding my judgment of the person underneath the humor. I couldn't connect with him on anything more then simple things. I still wished to have him be apart of my life, to still enjoy his company, but I had no need to dig deeper. It was time for me find new waters to swim in.",0

"There were many obsticles the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. First off, there was a great safety concern.

Second, the wind made it very challenging to dock the dirigibles. The winds were always changing because the violent air currents. Finally, there was already a law in place against airships flying to low over urban areas. So even if they fixed the other problems it would still be illegal to dock the dirigibles.

"In many CAPS1 libraries across the nation, a numerous amount of: books, magazines, movies and music aren't provided because they are found offensive. I do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and MONTH1 find different types of work offensive. Who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays?      Everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions. Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy and nerdy. The library is open to anybody that wishes to enter. What happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library, doesn't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out? What if their is a person that only reads scary books? What then will they have to read? I bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library. I do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in CAPS1 libraries. Everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries.     There is a reason that CAPS1 libraries are called CAPS1. That means that it is open to anyone and everyone. There should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from. Just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, does not mean that they can take it out of a CAPS1 library. That would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries. If you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the 'CAPS2 CAPS3' section of your library. For example: PERSON1, he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences. His ideas are very different than most. He writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing. It is his own writing style. If the people that choose what is in the libraries, don't find that appropriate or if they find it offensive, they should put it in the 'CAPS2 CAPS3' sections or even the 'CAPS3' section. It should be up to the childrens' parents what their kid is reading; not the library itself.     I do not believe that anyone should choose what is and isn't provided in libraries. Everybody is unique, different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas. If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what then will they have to read? What if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read? What then will you do? If everybody had the choice and right to do this, I don't think that anything will be left in libraries. All genres of everything should be available to the CAPS1. If you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the CAPS2 CAPS3 section of your library to still have it open to anybody. That would just be a big CAPS9 to anybody who decides to pick it up and read it. You need to think of everybody, not just yourself.",0
"The builders of the empire state buildings had many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Things such as the wind, the actual docking, and the people getting off safely. The actual docking was impractical it would be nearly impossible to connect the winch.     The wind was the main reason for the fate of the mast. First the wind current was so strong that the pilot would have a very difficult time getting close enough. The captain of the, ""Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds.

"In the excerpt ""The Mooring CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted their were obstactes the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was the terrible winds. In the excerpt it states how bad the winds are. One dirigible was going to try to dock there was the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't get close enough because of the very strong winds. The Captain feared the wind would blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on one of the buildings in the area and puncture the dirigible's shell. Another reason was their was already a law that stated against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it. The last and final obstacle they faced was the fear of crashing. Since most blimps from out of the country used hydrogen rather than helium it was dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. They heard about the blimp fire in New Jersey they realize how much worse an accident like that would be on such a densely populated area like downtown New York City. And that is the obsacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The huge wind gusts. The Law.

Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song.      I agree with the censorship in libraries today. Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem. Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as 'CAPS1' do not reach their shelves.     Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive. I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids. That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money, sex, and abuse. Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions. One example is a teen pregnancy book. The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consquences or abort the baby and move on with life. Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier. Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think?     In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries. It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea. Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment.",0

"I am going to tell you a story about when I was a young boy and, how I used to go on long trip with my father because he was a long-haul truck driver. Me and mi dad went many places around the LOCATION2 all of them being very fun and amazing. And we all had a lot of laughs The one that i liked the most though was when we went to LOCATION1 that place was so amazing there are so many things to do, as well as so many things to visit. Things that you could just see like the ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION1 that was pretty cool i thought and all of the monuments. My dad told me to go and see if i could get past security at the ORGANIZATION1 and i was like nah i am good you can though and i laughed at him; CAPS1 place that i liked a lot that we went to would have to be LOCATION3, even though it was very hot and muggy it was still fun. I remember my dad telling us that we had a lot of extra time and that he was going to be taking us to the zoo man was that cool we got to see all of the awesome animals such as the lions, the crocodiles, monkeys, gorillas , and the penguins. It was one of the best trips that my father ever took me on i liked it a lot. One of the funniest memories that i do remember is when we were driving throught the desert and there was this paper in the air and i did not know what it was so i was like, ""dad what is that""? and he says ""that is a falling star"" i was like ""in the middle of the day""? and it took me till about a couple years to figure out what it really was but now i know what it was and i just look back to that day and laugh.",0

"Libraries are ment for all types of books, movies, music, magazines. It gives you a variety of things to look at or even check out. An offensive book or movie or even music shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because it has a few bad things in it. People MONTH1 or MONTH1 not agree with this, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Through my own experiences, observations, and the reading I will help and explain my own opinion in why i dont think offensive books, movies,music, and magazines should not be taken off the shelf.     If a book is offensive it does not deserve to be taken off the shelf. Somebody most likley worked hard on that book so it could be put on to the shelf. If you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what books are in that section. I have not had any real experiences with this but I know people are awear of what are in the books before they're put onto the shelf and would therefore not put anything offensive next to a childrens book. Same thing with music and CAPS1's. Music is music and it is there to be listened too. People like all types of music and have their favorite bands so if they dont like certain bands because they swear or whatever doesn't mean that album deserves to be taken off the shelf. CAPS1's usually have the rating on the front so if it is not appropriate for your age than dont pick it up. If it has nudity or sexual content it will tell you or be put in a different section. For instance at my old library where I used to live in LOCATION1, LOCATION2 they would put all rated CAPS2 movies into a different section and if you were going to check it out you would have to be NUM1 or older or have a parent with you. It is really all up to the person, they could either make the right choice or the wrong choice. It's not the libraries fault if you pick up an offensive book because well, you should have some common sense.          The libraries shouldnt have to take offensive things off the shelfs because some people lack common sense or just dont know what they are doing. They could make more of an effort too kind of seperate bad from good, wrong from right, and even appropriate to non appropriate. But it is usually all up to the person making that decesion.                                                             - PERSON1",0
"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel.",0
The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong and she compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesnt bloom and Saeng fails her drivers test. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives and the geese return it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well.,0
"READ WITH CAPS1     I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials. When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find MONTH1 not cooincide with what they believe. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up.     Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. Childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers. Putting 'CAPS2 and CAPS3' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical. just as much as putting 'CAPS4 CAPS5' into the adults section.     In addition, author PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well. Thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read. the knowledge contained within them unknown.     There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as permisquous reading material, keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they MONTH1 not be able to fully understand.     With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas should be presented. Leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released.",0

"When constructing a building, workers will face tough obstacles, ecspecially when it comes to building the Empire State Building. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Al Smith and other architectural builders faced many problems. As stated in paragraph NUM1, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Also, as stated in paragraph NUM2, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Both of these obstacles were reasons that explain the failure of the mooring mast. The builders were not successful at their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.",0

"Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive?     I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons. Many different people have many different thoughts on whats offensive and what isn't like some people will find something funny that some people MONTH1 think is nasty or inapropiate. If you was to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has they're own oppenion. I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but thats the parents decision, not everyone has the same view on the material.     Certian materials should not be removed from shelves because of one persons oppenion on it. Everyone has they're own oppenion, some people like what other people don't everyone is different in they're own way",0

"Even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects. Some of the major bad effects of computers on people are no exercise, you can talk to strangers, and no interaction with family and friends. One of the effects of computers on people is no exersise. One of the most important effect of computers on people is no exersise. Right now many people in the LOCATION1 are obese because of bad eating and no exersise. One of the problems is that these people don'CAPS2 get off their computers and couchs to go outside. These people choose to stay indoors and just do nothing except watch CAPS2.V. and go on the computer. So computers have a big effect on how these people live their lives. Another problem caused by computers is kids talking to strangers. Most kids in the LOCATION1 are a member of a social network like CAPS3 or CAPS4. There are people out there that go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be a teen. This can get many kids in trouble if they are not careful on these websites. Since most people access these websites from their computers its another bad effect of computers on people. Another bad effect is no iteraction with family or friends. When people are on computers, they focus on whats on the computer and not about their surroundings. Being on the computer stops many people from interacting with their family and friends. Not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to weaken since they are always on the computer. This can become a serious problem if a person becomes too adicted to the computer. This can cause many problems between communication throughout the family making the family weaken. In conclusion even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects which can cause serious problems. Computers can cause tragaties in families andor in that persons's life.",0

"In my opinion computers are a help to our plant. The new technology makes life easier to handle. The computer are a help because it teaches hand-eye coordination. You can talk to people, and it is a new way to be entertained. Computers can teache hand-eye coordination because of typing. Whether someone knows it or not when you are typing fast it is help you hands. Also the fact you that if your typing without making is also helping because it makes your hand easier to move. The typing is giving your hand lots of exersise because your hands are moving all over the place. The more you move them the more excersise you can get. Computers can really help hand-eye coordination alot. Computers can also help by talking to people. To talk to people far away is better to talk to on the computer because if you have a webcam you can see each other. You are able to talk to people from different countries. Also computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different locations. Like if part of the business is doing a project in hong kong, then the boss can set up a meeting to see how it is going. Another way to use computers to talk to people is to speak with a person you are not able to see in person. Like if a oerson is in the hospital but you're not able to go, then you can talk while seeing each other throw the computer. Computers are a great way to use in communication. Computer are also a new way to get entertained. They can entertain you because there is games that you can play. There are games that come with the computers and a lot of games on the internet. Other they being bored all the time you can play thousands of game with just a click on a mouse. Also to not be bored you can watch videos like youtube. You can listen te musicor watch comedy videos. Video also show a way do express what you feel and sat it in comedy, horror, or sad videos. Also for teenagers there is ways to talk to their friends like facebook. On the website you can talk with anyone on your friends list. In the end computer can help kids, adults, or teenagers. With just a clicking your mouse you can find a new powerful way of technology.

"First, libraries are a good source of information. At the same time a library can have pros and cons to its information. Some information should be only seen by adults. Have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book? What's one way we can stop this?     Next, you can find information about everyday life. Through magazine, movies, music and books are ways you can find them out. You have explicit music where the artist curses, and says inapropriate things. There has been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life. I have a past experience with magazines too, such as 'CAPS1'. All these have to stay out of libraries or put in a section where children can't reach them.     Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways. The library should be divided into different parts. Music isn't really necessary at a library. They could throw the music out. Also, at the same time children shouldn't get their hands on the books but they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventaully. The committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also.     Finally, I've came up with a plan to fix this situation. I personally don't think they should throw these books out because this is how people make a living and some people actually like these things. So they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be NUM1 or older to enter and a identification card to prove it. Also, you must have a membership to that department. That way we don't have to worry about censoring these books, etc. Children will not be able to proceed in this section.     In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information. So they shouldn't throw these books, music, magazines and movies out. The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age. In that way they won't need censorship",0
"The invention of the mass on top of the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created created a new means of transportation but arrive with numerous flaws. One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put stress on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph NUM1)."" Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigible's to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents as stated in paragraph NUM2. In paragraph NUM3, it says that an existing law would prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made docking dirigibles atop of the Empire State Building illegal because dirigibles would be above the people which was against the laws. All of these obstacles made the transportations a failure and as a result the use of the mast had disappeared.",0

In the story it states, I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills.

"When you are using technology usually it is work related. A computer is used for work to write essays, make power points, and research, when people use them for facebook, myspace, CAPS1, and other chat live oovoo and websites it is more for their pleasure. I only go on facebook when I am checking my schedule for hockey, most kids use it for talk. Then there is oovoo & online video chat used for talking with friends but why not just callem'up. When I think of facebook or oovoo, or even myspace it makes me think of inapropriate pictures kids, and adults post. I think that is very unhumane and that is very dangerous to post ot because once it's out there you'll never get it back. For instance I am always outsided hanginaround when it's warm out, during winter I can understand going on facebook, but during the DATE1 there is no need just go outside and have fun. Kids wonder why they gain weight we'll if you'de get off your computer, and quit eating twinkies then you'll notice you just have to be active. some kids parents don't really give a flying faldoodle what their kids do all day. They don't care if their kid is NUM1 lbs. at the age of NUM2. They don't care if their kids are sitting on the computer eating all-day. If i could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato I would but I never go on the computer unless it is for homework. I used the computer just TIME1 I typed up all of my homework except for my math. I didn't play one game, I didn't check email go on the internet or anything I just worked my hardest and got it done. I conclude this with the fact that using a computer is not a bad thing, using it repeatedly and not exercising is. A computer shouldn't need to be used for pleasure it's not created to do so it's created to keep your life simpler. People pay money to buy a expensive computer and motem and all that expensive technological accesories, to make their lives much simpler not anywhere in thes essay did I say to play games because it's not. Playing games can be done outside, it doesn't have to be inside, and definately doesn't have to be on a computer. To make everyones life easier kids, get off your lazy butts, get off the twinkies, and stop playing on the computer.",0

The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.,0
"The authors setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclists location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since hes traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a persons body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.",0
"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very happy mood in his memoir. One reason the mood is happy is because of the setting. Narciso describes his house and says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back-drop to life in our warm home."" The author describes a home filled with many good friends and good memories. Anothe reason is how grateful the author sounds. It says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" While they had to leave everything behind they did it for their kids and for a new life. The author is happy that they did. Also, the author credits the house with giving him a family. CAPS1 says, ""It was here that I learned the real definition of the word 'family.' And for this, I will be forever grateful."" CAPS1 learned a lot in this house and is very happy for that. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir CAPS1 creates a very happy mood.",0
"CAPS3, my name is PERSON1 and I think that everyone has a right to there own opinion. People MONTH1 not want there kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them were there kids cant find them. Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot. There is a lot more bad things in life than a movies, books, and music that childreen listen to, watch, or read.     I think that the world is more harmfull sometime than anything. Adults MONTH1 want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on tv. But, if there kids wanna learn about things that happen thats not the greatest, then people should let them.     It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people dont like it. Why should other people have to change just for the ones who dont like it. There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchesed at the age of eight-teen. Thats why people should be ok with things that dont envolve minors. Having things censored ruins a lot of things, the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way.     I'm sure many people MONTH1 not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about. People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored. That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things. So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored. Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way.     Sincerely,      PERSON1",0

Secondly, he says he has thanked them so many times but he doesn't know how. Rodriguez says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me"" (NUM1). He is so thankful he doesn't even know how to put it in words CAPS1, Narciso knows even though they only had a three  room apartment he knew it was special. Narciso states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (NUM3). His parents couldnt give him much because they didn't have much money but it meant the world to him Clearly, the mood of this passage is gratitude",0
"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there are two contradicting moods. From chapters one to six Narciso said ""that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez describes in-depth as well. He mentioned Cuban cooking and music, not a single detail was left out. There was so much happiness and bliss at the beginning, but it's soon faded as Narciso spoke of his parents. Narciso's parents, PERSON2 and PERSON1, both sacrificed their lives to live in LOCATION1. ""In ORGANIZATION1 and Maria worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in LOCATION1."" They would take any job they could find. This mood quickly fades away as Rodriguez describes his gratefulness to his parents. Narciso is very lucky to have parents like PERSON2 and Maria to watch over him.",0
"There are lots and lots of arguments over the censorship of books and how they could affect children. Some people think that offensive books should be removed from library shelves. Others think that they should be left up there for the people who want to read them to do so. Some parents of children say that their child has became more offensive towards others, when others people think it is just bad parenting. So, you see that there are many different statements about offensive stuff being told to their children.      I think that there are some offensive things that need to be kept on shelves and that there are some that shouldn't. Some articles that are offensive should be left up on shelves because they might teach children of what is bad and what isn't. Other articles that have no reason for being offensive should be taken off shelves. For an example there is music that talks about being extremely harsh and disobedient to others when that erson has done nothing harmful. One example of  being offensive in a good way is the book 'PERSON1.' CAPS1 book showed how bad slavery was and how it should never happen again.      If there is a book or any other piece of material that is offensive in a good way; I want to read it and understand what it is trying to portray to me. If it is portraying a bad image, then it should be removed from shelves. If it isn't portraying a bad image then I believe that it should be taught to children so they can understand the affects and know the difference between what is right and wrong. Books that suggest harmful behavior towards anything without a purpose should be thrown away. CAPS1 is because children that read it could join in on what the book is suggesting. Then that could lead to bad consequeces for that person or someone else for that matter.      I have witnessed accounts where someone has listened to bad music or read about something bad and then have been changed by it, nut not in a good way. There has been incidents where that person did something illegal and then had to face the harsh consequences for that action. Then I have also seen accounts where people have been changed in a good way because of a book. I personally have been chaged by the book 'ORGANIZATION1' in a good way. Now I realize how bad that was towards colored people, so I behave nicely to them. since the are just as equal to everyone else.",0
"I believe that many books in our local libraries MONTH1 come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There MONTH1 be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries.              Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them. Some young adult books MONTH1 be venturing too far, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. I don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. Many parents have different rules for their children then others, and they MONTH1 not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. I remember times when I was a little my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted, because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place          As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. You know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading.     The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong. Some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically. Their parents MONTH1 be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching.     I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. I also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is aloud viewing. Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section",0
"In our town, more people are on the computer each day. Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. But, I believe that our town should not support advances in technology. You will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that. ""I think exercise shoud be a part of everybody's day,"" CAPS1 teacher PERSON1 from LOCATION1 stated. You would be so attatched to your computer, that you wouldn't work out. In the state of LOCATION1, it is proven that PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising and PERCENT2 are overweight by not eating properly. This shows more people in LOCATION1 don't exercise than not eating properly. CAPS4 wants to be overweight and you can change that! More people each year make facebook and CAPS2 CAPS3. Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. Instead, they do it online. ""CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent,"" PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. ""CAPS5 want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other,"" says CAPS6 CAPS7 PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town. If your town offers all of these activities, they are helping you out. Being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer! In many ways both advancing technology or not, why be inside doing nothing but talking to people? Go and talk to them in real life. Being in shape, talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go. Thank you for your concern",0

"In the memoir, the author creates a loving mood. I think he creates a loving mood as opposed to something else because of the way he describes and explains things. For example, when he is describing his parents cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". The phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"", ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,"". The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for  all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir.",0
Why the author concluds the story with ths paragraph because its telling the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start of with a new season then its something different. An I think thats why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus cause after spring is winter & when it was spring they have all the nice beautiful flower thats smell good. An when spring gone its winter so all the plants had died out they not going to be the same how they used to be.,0

"The author created a very positive and optimistic mood in the memoir. He talked about how his fascinating Cuban culture was portrayed throughout his home. The author said, ""passion Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote shows his love and pride for his culture. In the memoir, the author also tells about his extreme thankfulness towards his parents. He admired their courage. Narciso felt that his parents did all they could to give their family a good life and that they were successful. Narciso said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that he has a genuine appreciation for what they did. He believed that family is everyone that you love and are close to, not just blood relatives. Narciso considered his community to be one giant family. This memoir had an upbeat tone due to the positivity and optimism of the author.",0

"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives it talks about this fashion designers life. One example is in paragraph NUM1 page NUM2 it talks about his backround Narciso states ""My parent, originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956..."" The paragraph goes on talking about his parents and their names. Nex it is paragraph NUM3 page NUM2. This sets the mood of him growing up in a new inviorment. For example he States ""Growing up in this new instilled in me a great ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our nieborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a tim when overt racism was the norm of segregation prevailed in the United States."" CAPS1 is on page NUM5 paragraph NUM6. It shows the mood of how he loves his house. For example he says ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many thing or I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion this is how the mood creates the author.",0
"or getting some fresh air outside. I say those people are CAPS1! Computers are a giant step into new technology. For example, you can use the computer to do research for school, communicate with friends online and give children some down time where they can learn about far away places and people. If you were doing a research paper for school and you have checked out all the books on the subject of your paper, but you suddenly relized that you forgot one of the most important books! You race back to the library only to find out that it is closed. Computers then come in handy. You can google the book and find an online copy of the book, so you make the grade on that paper. Also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? That is what computers are there for! So you can easily go to your teachers website and there would be the explanation on how to do that specific lesson. Children CAPS2 to commonicate with their friends, to some extent. Such as a homework question or just to talk for fun. Without friends children would be knowhere. Statistics show that PERCENT1 of all children who are permitted to talk with friends, out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades. The internet was not just created for the heck of it. It was invented so people can communicate, childeren can do reaserch, and for fun and exploring as well. For example - learning about far away places, people, and culture, exploring animals, and even online shopping is now availble. These are necessities for all people to have access to. Without computers CAPS3 would not know the important news when CAPS3 needed to or information needed for a specific moment. Computers are the future (yes I am repertative) CAPS3 CAPS2 to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning purposes, teaching, research on places, animals, people, and culture. Also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it. This is why CAPS3 CAPS2 to continue forward with computers, and technology for the future. So all the people of LOCATION1 keep your computers, they are an important stepping stone needed for growth and moving onto the future of technology.

"Setting is a very important element to the story Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit: by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting.",0
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the docking itself, nature and the overall construction of these dirigibles. There was all so an existing law against these air ships.Docking the dirigibles to the top off the Empire State Building would add a great amount of stress to the building. The builders would have to spend sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building overall. The greatest safety issue was the construction of these balloons from outside the United States. They used hydrogen which was highly flammable, there was one incident on May 6, 1937 where the German dirigibles caught on fire. This was known as the Hindenburg's accident. Builders knew this can risk to the densely populated area of New York. But the greatest obstacle was nature itself. When the dirigibles would dock violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to swivel round and round the Mooring Mast. The law against airships were they were not allowed to fly low around urban areas.",0

"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there were many factors in the way of dirigibles docking at the mooring mast. When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" went up in flames in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building realized quote how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph NUM1). Another obstacle was the existing law against low-flying airships in urban areas. This law makes is so that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph NUM2). The greatest obstacle of all however, was mother nature. The winds that high in the sky were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and would be unsafe to passengers and pedestrians on the street below. All of these factors contributed to the project never being fulfilled in New York.",0

"CAPS1 you imagine life without your computer? No? Well that's what I am trying to change. Millions of CAPS2 spend countless hours with their eyes glued to 'ORGANIZATION2, ORGANIZATION3 and CAPS3 monitor screens. Spending that much time sitting in one space isn't healthy, not only do people not get enough exercise but they don't get the chance to apperiate the natural world around them that is ever changing. Teens and even small children get lost in cyberworld and don't use their after school time wisely to study or do homework. The internet is also a dangerous place and the growing computer use with maximize the problem. To begin, the obesity rate in LOCATION1 is growing rapidly, a recent study done by the LOCATION2. goverment shows that NUM1 people are over weight and NUM2 people are on the of obesity. We CAPS4 could decrease the obesity rate and be healthier and happier by exersicing and getting out more. Spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming over weight. Secondly, the more time you spend cooped up inside the less time you get to enjoy nature.

"I once learned something very valuable in school. I didn't learn it in a class room, or even form a book. I learned this lesson in a hallway near the copy room. One MONTH1 be prompted to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a hall? All I will tell you is this, it's not one I'll be forgetting any time soon.  In order to completely understand what exactly I was doing roaming the halls and learning lessons, you're going to need a little bit of background. I was in my third period class; which was leadership at the time. Leadership isn't really your conventional class from the perspective of an outsider. Kids running about the school like loose mice MONTH1 give off an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was. We weren't doing anything bad, it's just that most of the time you would have to leave the class room in order to do what needed to be done that day. Leadership directly preceded myleast favorite class of the day, CAPS1 CAPS2. I simply detested that class. I had been in CAPS1 classes ever since I was in kindergarten at ORGANIZATION1. I was a sophomore at the time and that language had been bugging me for the past ten years. It wasn't that I was bad at it or anything because really, I wasn't. I just had a strong contempt for CAPS1 class. The teacher always gave me a hard time, probably because I had a big mouth and I tended to talk a lot. She was that type of person who had CAPS10 posture and was a stickler for the rules. The the type of person you could see wielding a yard stick as a deadly weapon.  In leadership that specific class period, the teacher was taking a particularly long time explaining what we were supposed to do that day. He sometimes did this, he was famous for being long winded. He could take the entire NUM1 minute class period just talking about an assignment that would have taken ten minutes to do. That day however, we weren't doing an assignment. At least not what a normal person would consider to be your typical assignment. Another girl from the class, CAPS5; and myself were working on a special project. We had to retrieve something very important from my car. We waited for the teacher to finish talking and asked if we could go, he said yes. We walked out the double doors of the classroom and into the main hallway, we then proceeded on down toward the parking lot. As we were walking we passed by the office doors, the CAPS6 hall, and the library. Just as we were about to walk by the copy room door, I saw PERSON2. PERSON2 was in my CAPS1 Two class the year before and I thought that I would say hi to him. I did, I then asked if he was taking CAPS1 CAPS2 that year. He replied with a no. I told him, ""CAPS10 thing, because CAPS1 CAPS2 sucks!"" I didn't know it at the time, but I would be eating those words by the truck load in just a short while. Not five seconds after I had said that to PERSON2, CAPS5 was tugging on my shirt sleeve trying to get me out of the building. I told her to calm down and that it was rude to interrupt people when they are talking.  After I had said bye to PERSON2, CAPS5 hurried me out the door and she burst into laughter. I was taken-aback by her sudden outburst of laughter and questioned her as to what she was laughing about. It was right then that LOCATION1, my CAPS1 teacher, poked her head out the door and said to me in her thick accent, ""PERSON1, I hear you don't like my class!"" I must have been as red as a tomato. I just stood there with the dumbest look on my face. The kind of look that jumps on your face when you wish you had a rewind button for your mouth. I looked over my right shoulder just in time to see CAPS5 gasping for air because she was laughing so hard. I redirected my attention to LOCATION1, she was just standing there with an angry face covering up the laughter that was trying to break through. There I was, not ten steps away from my car and I, for once, had nothing to say. The lesson I learned that day was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river. Or at least make sure the alligator isn't in the next room. Especially if the alligator teaches your next class.",0

Their neighborhood is made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immagrants. The author has also made a few friends his first one being Alegria or the landlord's daughter.

"CAPS1's the dillemant CAPS2 that people are supporting computer technology and others are not. I firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect. This is because many jobs are using them everyday and it is very efficiant for them. Also, having computers allows people to connect with other people, edit things that other technology cannot, and play fun games, CAPS3 effect that computers have is educational websites; games, and articals. This helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job. Primarily. computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently. Jobs such as ORGANIZATION1 and any type of police work provide sarely for people all around the united states and other parts of the world. My father always told me, ""Computers save people everyday"". Even schools use computers! They provide educational information about the students in schools, and my school, LOCATION1 school, uses them quite often. For example, I see my teacherm. Mr, CAPS4 his computer every single movning in homeroom. Nearly PERCENT1 of all jobs involve a computer by storing information or any other purposed fealuired. Would you want all those people to lose ther job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology? I know I wouldn't, CAPS5 keep in mind computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people. In addition, computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do. This is things like staying in town with someone far away, or editing photos. Even playing a game on the computer could ne relaxing to almost anyone. CAPS6 is an example of keeping in town with someone else. For me, CAPS6 is a life-saver. It allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his chaotic college. In fact, nearly PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website live CAPS7, CAPS6, or CAPS9. Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired. I don't want my pictures and my CAPS6 deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer since it me have an enjoyable time and entertains me well. Thirdly, computers have a positive effect on people because they give aduts and kids tree access to education. I remenber my old elementery school used to play many amusing math games. These were CAPS5 my education grew greatly dae to this game. Games as these are used frecquently thoughout the world. In addition jobs have been lost from this had economy. However, jobs we hering found more and more everyday from adults trying to find a decent job online. Computer saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers, computers are a good idea To conclude. I imploor you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. Computers are like a pencil to a student. for they are very important. Jobs use them everyday, connections are made by people, and education grows because of them. That's why the technology or computers effects people in a good way.",0

The author was thirsty and the side of the building had A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth (Kurmaskie NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope (Kurmaskie NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.",0
"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first town, and described it as only having one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldnt refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp  If you want bait for the big ones, weve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist.",0
"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main problem was safety. When the front was masted to the building the back would move around. Another big problem was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Also, it was illegal for airships to fly that low over urban areas. Another obstacle was that the dirigible could not get close enough to the building because of wind.",0
"Laughter is important, we all know that. It makes life easier, happier and even helps you live longer. It's also very important to relationships. When talking about preference in significant others it's often that people mention that they want someone who can make them laugh, this is why. this story is , however, not about dating. It is about how laughter can cause you to go from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next.  I had known PERSON1 for a while for a few months at this point, I had met him on the bus. He was pale, skinny, loud, and he always had something funny and offensive to say. He was a shut in. Before I met PERSON1 I could dish it out but I couldn't take it. I remember one day, the day I went from hating him to befriending him, we were fighting about something so insignificant that I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Although I do remember what he said. He said that I was a ""hypocritical, arrogant asshole who would go around making fun jokes at other peoples expense but would get up in someones face if they tried one at me."" this made me laugh. Not because everything he said was right but because it made me realise that PERSON1 was actually a pretty good guy whose only real problem was that he didn't know when to shut up. Throughout the whole time I have known PERSON1 he has never stopped smiling. He laughs off everything from stepping in dog crap to his fathers drug addiction he can dull the pain of any blow with laughter. PERSON1 is my constant reminder to never stof laughing.",0

"The builders of the Empire State building had a grand idea of including a mooring mast where dirigibles, also known as zeppelins or blimps, could dock themselves. Though the idea was good, it provided the builders with many obstacles. For example, when the framework was being built, the mast was going to have to be added to the top. The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however because if a dirigibles were to the moored there, it would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive.Another difficulty the builder's faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature. The building was 1,250 feet tall, so the winds up at the top were constantly changing and dangerous, making it difficult for the dirigible remain stationary when moored. Also, something the builders didn't foresee was the laws against blimps flying to low over urban areas. These two challenges ended up making the use of the mooring mast impossible",0
"The cyclist has to over come a lot of obstacles. For example, there is a snake in his path, so he cationly rides around it. Also, there are alot of hills and he wasnt sure if he could make it up those hills. Furthermore, he is almost out of water so he could die of heatstroke or dehidration. In conclusion he over comes these obsticles and achieves his goal.",0
"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with several obstacles on they attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they encountered was designing a mooring mast that could with hold the stress of the dirigible's load. In stanza NUM1 the author writes, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" CAPS1, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to ameliorate this problem. Next, the greatest obstacle they faced was the strong winds on top of the building. In stanza NUM2, it say, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This arrived as a huge problem as the architects could not weigh down the back of the ship because it could endanger pedestrians. Lastly, in stanza NUM3 it states there is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" CAPS1, it would be illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building or even come close to the area. Due to these three obstacles the plan of using a mooring mast became an idea of the past.",0
The mood created by the author in this memoir is careing and happiness. There is a lot of careing and happiness in this story. There is a lot of careing because he cares about his family and all that thay do for him. He also cares that his parent made the house traditional Just like back in Cuba. He also cares that his parents do so much for other people. There is a lot of happieness because he is happy to live in LOCATION1 and to have such wonderful parents. He is happy that his parents teach him all the traditional thing that they used to do in Cuba. Last but not least he is happy because he lives with everyone he loves.,0
"There were many problems with allowing dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building. When designing the mast they realized that with the weight of the dirible, the buildings frame would have stress. (paragraph NUM1) They also noticed that the diribles from other countries used hydrogen and not helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph NUM2). A factor of building the mast that was out of the builders control was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. (paragraph NUM3). Law was also a problem when wanting to construct the mast. There was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. (paragraph NUM4). With the factors of weight, gas, nature, and law the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.",0
"Home is where the heart is, many of said this and many more have meant it. In the non-fictional memoir by PERSON1 talks about the importance of family. Narciso pats many moods into the story and describes them with such grace. ""Friends and celebrations both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (paragraf NUM1) This gives a sence that for him home was the safest and happiest place for him to be. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open the the many people we considered family."" (paragraf NUM2) This gives off the mood that his home was a very careing place and that anyone that they loved was cared for. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'.""

"CAPS4 fills the air around us with happiness and joy, CAPS4 brings warm memory's of loved ones that are close to us , and adds a splash of hope to those who need CAPS4. Laughter is the key to solving life's problems.CAPS4 is a way of adding something special into our life and comes from many different areas of life .Laughter could come from a pitiful joke that someone could have told you,CAPS4 could be brought up by a show, and CAPS4 could also come from the joy we get when a near loved one has returning home from a long journey. Imagine seeing something comical like a person falling down or crashing into a pole , the moment right when that happens you hear your self laughing as hard as you can that you practically cant breath and the person standing right next to you is joining in on the laugh. Although CAPS3 might seem rude and disrespectful you have just made a bond with the person right next to you and found a similarity between the both of you. CAPS3 is how friendships are brought up and made, just by one little thing that made you both laugh and have a connection with each other can trigger a brand new friendship between to people that could either last a minute or can last a life time. In my case CAPS3 is how I met one of my closest friend ever , we had seen a student from our class trying to show the class how cool he was by climbing up the flag pole and replace the ORGANIZATION1 state flag with his own personal home made flag ( he got the CAPS1 off of a show ) ,as he was heading up the pole almost half way their he must have gotten scared because minutes later he started yelling for help, a minute later the faculty members finally heard his cry's and yells and tried to get him down from ware he was, CAPS4 took them almost half an hour to get him down. CAPS3 was the moment ware I had made one of the greatest friendship I've ever had in my life. Many friendships are made in class and with the people you go to work with but a great friendship is brought up by a simple laugh two people share with each other. God laugh's last. CAPS3 is the name of PERSON1 son of CAPS2 and PERSON2. In CAPS3 story PERSON2 the CAPS5 of PERSON1 claimed that she was surprised when she was blessed with her only child and that people would laugh and be surprised the same way she was when they hear the news. Being surprised or shocked can also bring some one to laugh at what either happened in their surroundings or what they did them self's. I remembered a time ware I laughed at something that took me by surprise, CAPS4 was when my CAPS5 lost the keys to the house inside the car, we looked for them every ware but had no luck finding them, after an hour had pass we called my dad so he would bring the other key to the house, after we called him we had to wait half an hour for my dad to get their but as soon as my father parked in the driveway my CAPS5 found the key that she lost inside her pocket (CAPS4 was a typical cartoon moment).When we heard the news we all just started laughing at what has just happen, we were all shocked and a little dumbfounded when that happened. As you can see being surprise can also bring a smile and a laugh onto someones face. Picture yourself staring into the eyes of some one close to you with a blank face and trying not to let out the slightest bit of a giggle or a smile and then find yourself laughing nonstop for no reason. That is basically an every day thing for me and my sister. My sister and I can't stare at each other for even a minute, we eventually start laughing the first five seconds and end up laughing a hole hour without stop, but as soon as we stop laughing we note's that we were laughing for no apparent reason , which would make us laugh for another hour more.That the kind of laughter that two people that are so close to each other get , the kind that you don't need a reason to laugh but you end up laughing for no reason at all.CAPS3 shows the connection two people have with each other the type ware you know what the other person is thinking. Laughter can come from old memory's of family gatherings for the holidays , friendships we made when we were in school , memory's of our childhood and how thing we thought then were in style and cool are k now thing we look back into and laugh at, by being a little surprise, and can also be The fact that we know someone by heart .",0
"I believe computers doesn't benefit society. I feel this way being that lack of email skills, no exercising, and its addicting. Read on for further explaing. Firstly, spending hours and hars on the computer gives you no social skills what on ever. You could think before you reply and most people online talk or write way differently there then in person. People could act like someone else. Online you could erase what you wrote but in person you can't. Thats way you simply can't gain social skills sending all this time talking online. Next, you get no exercises. On a nice beautiful DATE1 you'll be inside on the computer when you could be getting exercise. Being on line sitting down doing nothing just talking makes you lazy. When you're older you'll have to be writing. You can't just good all these long house on the computer. Furthermore, you should have your time for on the computer and exercising. Finally, its addicting some people could good hours and hours on the computer looking up all these videos. Seven out of ten teenagers rather be inside in the computer talking to people rather then meeting new people elsewhere. I think parents should restrict their children's time to be on computers. All this time with this fun could be spent doing studying or something to help you out in the future. In conclusion, i believe computers doesn't benefit society. I feel this way being lack of social skills, no exercise, and addicting. I think some people shold limit their time another computer and expand their time doing something important.",0

"In the short story Do not exeed the speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has great impact on the cyclist. In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as ""CAPS1"". As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic he continued moving to the next town, which was NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""PERSON2 and wilberss fish camp.

"CAPS1 has come to my attention that those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people and others are disagreering with this comment. In my point of view I believe that computers are effecting some people today and that people are spending a hudge amount of time on computers. The time spent on computers is getting outragous! Many people are just sitting home and staying on thier computer just playing games. Although the computer can be a great way to pay bills and come in contact with others faraway, people are taking advantage of computers and even billing others online. Since your not right infront of the person or near by the computer is a tool for many people to say threatning things without anyone else knowing which could cause fights, or other terrible things. The computer can also be very dangerous in many ways. For example sites like myspace and twitter can be dangerous for teens because of rapest. Some random person colud just start talking to you and ask you to meet them some where which could be dangerous. The computer is also dangerous because you could have inappropriate pictures posted on websites of you and not even know CAPS1! The last reason why computers and laptops effect people is because of hacking. This is a big issue especially if you have a webcam. Some people know how to back your webcame and can watch what your doing without you knowing. People can also hack into your computer and look at all your documents. I think computers is a big effect on people today and this effect should be solved!",0
"Libraries have always had interesting materials, such as, books, music, movies, and magazines, and there always will be. Libraries are one of the best places to find those materials.          I do not believe that libraries should have to remove those materials from their shelves because maybe some people find them interesting? Thats all that libraries like are people interested in reading their books. If some people find different books offensive then they shouldn't go near those books. If they have a complaint then they should just keep it to themselves and not ruin the chance for others to check them out.     Libraries shouldn't have to take certain material out of there shelves because some people don't like them, its your choice to read that book, nobody is making you read something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Now say if there were a numerous amount of people that take offense to the materials in the library, then the library could decide whether they want to or not, but they still dont need to be told what to do. Its their business and they decide what materials stay and which ones go.     If I was one of those who took offense to a book in the library then i would just keep it to myself. I wouldn't like to go through all of that trouble of arguing and complaining just becouse of one book. Think of others before you think of yourself sometimes and what their interests are.

"I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship. In all my relationships whether it be friends,family,or a girlfriend laughter is always an important element of all of them.  the best relationship i have is with my best friend PERSON1 and it is filled with laughter. We always have a great time together, like last DATE1 when she and I went to snow peak with some friends and I tore ligaments in my knee when I jumped PERSON2's quad. We laughed about me being stupid and getting hurt for it and we laughed about CAPS1 big ears and how they make him look like CAPS2 the elephant.  I think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met she was dating one of my friends and the first thing I did was make her laugh and ever since then we have been awesome friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest fest, with her and I did and a made her laugh the whole time. Now I'm her dork and she is my best friend. The biggest thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest fest, was when I did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of LOCATION1 in my lip.

"CAPS1 CAPS2 is PERSON1 I CAPS3 to CAPS4 CAPS5 CAPS6 I am in the NUM1 grade. The reson for this letter is that I belive that certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive. The reson why I think it should be done because kids know days minds be every where from pron to games to bad music etc.            In CAPS7 books, magazines, movies, have things in it that shouldnt be in there. When kids get a hole of it they act like they anit never seen nothing like it. When they get on the computer they get on web sites that they know they are not suppossed to be on. If we didnt have these things we wouldnt have to worry about the loud music, the virus on the computer and the books being riped up. But know a days there are so much stuff people can do to get all of things.           If someone just removed all the things that are found offensive from the shelves. That would be so wonderful for everyone. If they leave all the materials out there its going to be more and more problmes. When they just take it off everything will be in grate shape",0

If you read paragraph NUM1, you can imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (""surrogate grandparents"") were around it. Also, in paragraph NUM2, it talks about the Passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air ""and the ""aromas of the kitchen"". If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is evident in the excerpt. This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what.

So then the lady that was bout to cut my hair came to me and said I am so sorry, but I told you the wrong time and I said oh it's ok l can wait. And when she got done with they hair the ladies came to me and said they was sorry. So then she had NUM2 person left and by the time she get done be getting on like NUM3 - NUM4. And that was the time I was being patient.",0
I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasnt ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasnt mentally prepared. So inconclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasnt physicaly and mentally prepared for it.,0
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the girl Saeng CAPS1 the drivers test ""I-I failed the test"" said Saeng. She had bought a hibiscus because the flower remined her of some of the memories from home and the hibiscus she had at herhouse. at the end she says that she will retake the test when the geese come back, the snow has melted and the hibiscus is budding. She does this I think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng. They both did something wrong or CAPS1 something Saeng failed the test and the hibiscus was constrited to a pot. But they both are going to change the bad thing..",0
"The affects of the settings was how hot it was and the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, very hot. And the roads were not smooth, the were very old and ragady.",0
"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agian."", to show that the hibiscus plant has given Saeng hope. It has helped he get threw some rough and difficult times. In the story Saeng has just failed her CAPS1 test and had to walk home. She was very upset. On her way home Saeng saw a familiar flower. She had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen. The employee pointed her towards the flower. The hibiscus brought back many memories at her hometown in vietnam. Saeng planted her flowers in the vegtable garden. That flower had given her hope. She is ready to try the CAPS1 test again.",0
"The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the metaphor compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.",0
"When the Empire State Building was created it was supposed to be a ""pit stop"" for dirigibles, known today as blimps. It was meant to be the modern way of travel, but many problems surfaced changing the plans. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a major safety hazard! Another problem presented itself ""[A] law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" If anything were to go wrong with the ship many people would be put in danger. The harsh wind nature would provide the risk of puncturing the blimp against buildings; also endangering the people below it.",0
"Censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept. With the advent of social media, we now have thriving communities of people that want their voice to be heard, and people are listening. We now are able to tap into the huge ammount of knowledge from people all around the world, allowing us to see what is really happening in the countries like LOCATION2, where media is considered treason. What do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet? Lets start by looking an arguement that has been long talked about: library censorship.     Today, it is almost a requirement for cities to have public libraries to be considered as real cities. Public libaries, and the funding they require, are not anywhere within the ORGANIZATION1. Even so, they have taken a place in our neighborhoods that has made them indefinate sources of knowledge and culture. One public library MONTH1 be a source of; historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non-fiction books, fiction books, magazines, and many other types of entertainment and knowledge. Public libraries are, even with the widespread usage of the internet, important places for us, as residents of a city, to socialize and learn.     Libraries today MONTH1 carry books that were in the past on the 'banned books' list, but that does not mean books are not being banned from libraries. Libaries are generally family institutions, and as being funded by the public, required to adhear by the moral and ethical standards of those who live in the area. This means that there is not one, 'national banned books list', but there many discrepencies througout LOCATION1 in banning books. As culture moves more and more into more and more questionable materials, libaries are faced with a tough decision; keep up with the times and have more questionable and controversial reading material, or get lost in the past and try to kling onto the senior generation to stay alive.     Bringing new literary materials into the library that is fresh and new means that more people will return to the library again, be it young-adults or older adults trying to get in touch with the current world. One major controversy of books in public libaries are the inclusion of sexual intimacy. As a new generation sprouts, fed with music lyrics by such names as; 'ORGANIZATION2', or 'ORGANIZATION3', we enter a new age where younger and younger kids are learning about sex. The authors of today have recognised this and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, but not detailed encoutners. I believe this is fine, because as we move on in generations we are going to find out that education about sex; safe sex, birth control, CAPS1 prevention and testing, is much more important than trying to keep children ignorant. Keeping these young adults involved in books and trying to continue their learning outside of school is a much larger issue we should be trying to tackle instead of trying to create silly arguments against new reading material in a public libary.     Public libaries are the centerpiece for learning outside of school in many communities, small and large. Knowing this, how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons? Even as a commercial buisness, this would make no sense, simply turning people away because you have a single view of what the future is and you refuse to listen to anyone else's opinion of the future. So why is there a question on including new knowledge? Isn't it obivous that we, as a nation, should show the world that we aren't living in the past. That we are indeed the future of the world, and that our young-adults will recieve the best education in the world by not only learning in schools, but by being the most active readers, and by extension, learners in the world.",0
The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now.,0
"The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough. The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it.",0
"Everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want. Sometimes it's not always up to them. For example rated-CAPS1 movies, most children under NUM1 cannot watch them. Either its a law or the parents have made it a rule. Music I think is different. Some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing, certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message. Libraries should not have those kind of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people want to view those kind of things that other people find 'offensive' they should buy them on their own time. Not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people MONTH1 find funny other people get offended by. Even if libraries had anything that would offened someone else, it would be the readers choice to pick a book they want to read.      Sometimes it MONTH1 be better off if the children read these articles by themselves so it'd save time from having parents explain it to them later. They might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for. For example, when my brother watched a rated-CAPS1 movie. In my brother's younger years he was always curious and asked a lot of questions all the time. Sometimes my mother didn't know how to respond so she'd change the subject. Well, everyone knows the same old question 'CAPS3 do babies come from?'. That's the kind of question my brother was curious about. My mom never bothered to answer that question, but if she did she would make up some story. My brother was smart enough to know that what he was being told wasnt accurate at all. Finally one day he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking. It happen to have the answer to his question. He was shocked and disgusted at the same time yet he was glad to know he finally found the answer my mom wouldnt give.     In this situation I am somewhat nuetral. I dont object to having things that might offened other people be removed from book shelves but on the other hand it might not be a good thing to put 'offensive' things and certain libraries CAPS3 children can get to them. Perhaps it's what makes things not boring and makes it more interesting to the reader. Not everyone has the same opinion on things. It just MONTH1 be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion. Everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either.     The bad thing about having any 'offensive' things in libraries MONTH1 not be a smart idea if it's CAPS3 most children get there books. Parentscan always have a say in what kind of book their children read or what kind of movies they watch. Some parents might not want to go through all the questions the children ask and give something to them that will explain it better for there understanding, while other parents dont want their children  to see or know of any sort of things that MONTH1 be 'offensive' until their old enough to understand it better and are mature about those things. So in some cases it might be bad idea for things that only an adult should know be on book shelves in a library CAPS3 a child might get ahold of it.     The quotation ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own opinion. The quotation is basically  saying if even a parent doesnt want their child to read something 'offensive' if that parent reads it that sometime their children have a right to know. If the child has tooken anything like that off a shelf that once they know they will not ask anymore questions.",0
"A time that I was patient was when I took my first CAPS1 test this year. The test was not too hard, but not easy. I finished it with about one and a half hours left. For an hour and a half I had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent. Sitting still and quiet for even five minutes is hard for a NUM1 year old, imagine NUM2 minutes! At first I was fidgeting, then my neck started to hurt, so I layed my head down. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still. Soon enough the time flew by and the CAPS2.E.A.P was over (done for the day). I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those NUM2 minutes.",0
"Laughter is a very important part of life, for many different reasons. Some MONTH1 say that its vital to survive, one needs laughter to have a full and rich life. Sometimes laughter can hurt more than it helps. This is a statement I myself believe, and have concluded from the actions and outcomes in my life. Laughter can show emotions towards a statement, or lack of emotions. Laughter can make someone either depressed or happy. It is true when someone says there is a difference when someone is laughing at you, as opposed to someone laughing with you. When a friend or a group of friends laugh with me, its an amazing, self esteem raising emotion. This laughter brings friends closer, and causes us to trust each other more. One time I thought laughing was appropriate at the time but then later felt awful. One scorching DATE1 day my friends and I decided to venture to the mall, being we lived in apartments and lacked the money for an air conditioner. We all agreed it was a splendid idea. When we reached the mall we were relieved by the cool breeze as the doors swung open, as if to greet us. All of us are very introverted so shopping around in an over crowded mall wasn't our cup of tea. Not knowing what to CAPS1 we sat on a bench and did what we call people watching. Their was this girl, I will always remember her; CAPS4 was one of those girls you peer at just for a minute and you know CAPS4 was rich. A sort of stuck up girl, a walk where CAPS4 means to exaggerate her hips and bounce her perfect bleach blond hair.  The girl passed by us and stuck her nose in the air as if we were not even remotely good enough to be in her presence. Quite a bit angry I stood up after CAPS4 strolled past and mocked her strut. My friends found this hysterical. Roars of laughter leaped from their mouths. The pressy girl stopped proceeding forward and then started approaching us. CAPS4 grimaces at us all snobby-like and says, ""CAPS1 you guys like have a problem or something?"" CAPS2 covered my face, I didn't know what to say. Fortunately my best friend stepped in and said, ""CAPS3, we think your dress is very pretty."" CAPS4 believed us, then walked off, in a rather less snobby sort of way.  Through this weird and interesting experience my friends and I learned a lot. One, people can hear you talking crap about them from a mile away. Two, laughter can bring friends together, but can also have some consequences. I CAPS1 not know for sure if CAPS4 did hear or see us mocking her. But I knew inside I felt a little bad. Sure laughing at her in the time felt right, amusing. Looking back on it, I feel awful. I have been in that same situation but on the receiving end. It is not pleasant having people talking crap about you behind your back and laughing uncontrollably. Laughing is very vital to life but needs to be appropriate.",0
"""CAPS1 no!' I forgot the deffinition to this homework problem and I dont have my notes. Now, in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results. This is why I believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpfull because you can find information that you've been needing. You can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to talk to lostly if you are just sitting around and having nothing to do you can just go on the computer and discover things you MONTH1 not have known. Having access to a computer is a real and very helpfull because if your just having a conversation with someone and you forget a name of an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. For me, a lot of the times I just need information about maybe a sports player of facts about a famous event. Since our technology is so up to date the computer is right there sitting with many of the helpfull facts we would like to know. Friends are a big part of my life and I love just to talk to them and see how they are doing. Again, our technology is so advanced now that there is a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. A big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for taking to people that are very far away and the ones you dont normally see. On a computer you can talk to people from not only all over the CAPS2.S.A but even in other countrys! Finally, the times I find having a computer around me most helpfull is when I am just bored with nothing to do! I can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things I MONTH1 have learned in school or wanted to learn. On the internet there are many things to keep you occupied like games or ou can even watch movies from your home onto the computer! If you have a computer around your house you should not be bored because there is many things you can be doing or even learning! Having a computer around your house is so helpfull, you can have fun but your even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. Computers are the future and its a good one. So I suggest you pick one up and just have a blast, you wont be sorry.",0

"Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with.",0
"The mood created by the author's tone in this memoir is appreciation which is displayed in three important places. First, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, creates the mood of appreciation when talking about how his parents lef cuba. He explains ""they came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (NUM1). This description shows the mood of appreciation because it shows the author's parents left ""selflessly"", ""to give their children a better life,"" which implies that his parents MONTH1 not have wanted to come to LOCATION1, but they knew it would be the best place for him, so they came anyway, which clearly creates a mood of appreciation through Narciso's tone. Additionally, the mood of appreciation created when Rodriguez declares ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (NUM2). This informs the reader outright that rodriguez is"" ""greatful to his parents"", which creates the mood of appreciation should through his tone. Finally, the mood of appreciation is created when Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (NUM3). This statement insinuates appreciation because Rodriguez is informing the reader that ""he will never forget"", what his parents have done for him, which carries the message that it changed his life, creating the mood of appreciation through his tone. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez creates the mood of appreciation through his tone in this memoir to his parents.",0
"Almost everyone is effected by computers in some sort of way. Some people think computers are bad because some people spend too much time on their computers. The thing is computers help us with our everyday life. If we want to comunicate with people from around the world to send donations to places in need like LOCATION1 or CAPS1, we can use computers to do that. We can chang people's lifes in third world countries with the help of computers. Computers can also help us in school. When a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it. Or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer. Maybe a kid forgot his homework, he can go to his school website and find it. My last point would be that computers are a huge help for buisnesses. When files are lost or misplaced, the worker(s) can use the computer and bring up the back-up file. When they need to order supplies, most times they will go to a web site and order online. Or when updates are posted about up coming events in that company, an e-mail is sent out and is found using a computer. Many people think that people overuse their computers, but that the users fault not ours. We should choose how long were using one computers. Many jobs would be impossible with out computers. It's not about overusing them its about. So over all I say computers are good and very useful when used in the right hands.",0
"Patience is having control over yourself write you wait. In order to be patient you have  to wait until whatever you are waiting on is done. CAPS1 means to have composure over yourself. Fon example if you go to the doctor office for a yearly check up , you have to sit in the waiting room for at reast one hour before they call your name. But patience is sometimes. Like when you are waiting on a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza CAPS1 takes about NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, an CAPS1 is ,is something someone mode up. Not that people have patience",0
"A time when I was patient. Two weeks ago CAPS4 CAPS2 said her CAPS1 was coming. CAPS4 grandma was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets cost a lot of money. It is NUM1 dollar. That was a lot of money. She CAPS11't miss this bus because I really want to see her. I could not wait. So she was suppose to be coming on DATE1. She didn't come. I was sick so I called CAPS4 CAPS2 at her job. I said, ""CAPS2 why didn't CAPS3 come."" CAPS4 CAPS2 said,"" CAPS5 she is coming you just have to be patient."" CAPS6, I said. Next day was DATE2. ""CAPS2 is she here yet"" I said. ""CAPS8, CAPS5 be patient she will be here tomorrow."" ""CAPS6, I understand.""I gave up I thought that she was not coming. So CAPS4 mom called CAPS4 godmom. She said it was CAPS6. So she told me she was going to ORGANIZATION1. I love ORGANIZATION1. I so good. I asked CAPS4 CAPS2. ""CAPS11 I have a CAPS12. ORGANIZATION2 cheese burger. I said CAPS13 to CAPS4 uncle and CAPS4 mom said she was not coming. I told CAPS4 mom I was not giving up she was coming. So I said I am hanging up. So I air hustled. CAPS4 mom said to CAPS4 uncle CAPS14 ""should I get her something to eat. I thought she ment CAPS4 grandmother. So I thought for a while her who is her. So I called back CAPS4 mom said ohh I get food for uncle CAPS14 dog. I said, PERSON1's?  For a dog? She said know dog food. So CAPS4 mom got me from CAPS4 god mothers house I could not walk because CAPS4 legs, back, arm and every part that I CAPS11 move on CAPS4 body hurt. So CAPS4 grandmother came to her house because we have a keys. So she said where CAPS16? CAPS4 uncle whispered something and I said she here! Ran in CAPS4 uncle room and hug her I said how are you because when I went for CAPS4 grandmother birthday. She live in south caroline so yeah. The is CAPS4 writing. That is when I was patient. So I could wait for CAPS4 mom's CAPS1.",0
"The mood created by the author. Is that CAPS1 was talking about is that theres some families that come from every were and so Narciso Rodriguez is prowed of coming from Cuba.""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowlege of the language or the culture. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

"In a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason. Some of the books take race, sexism, bullying, ect., to extreme. Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books, magazines, movies, music, ect., would have to be scary. The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are. Would you want your child, that's NUM1, to go out and do what the other NUM1 year olds do because they think it is cool for others to do?     Remember back in the days when you were young and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation wasn't like the generations now? Well, these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now. Taking some books off a shelf, or taking profanities out of a song will not hurt a child or teenager one bit. These things are telling your children it is ok to have sex, smoke, drink, or even cuss.      I know that my mother worries about me NUM3, because she's always calling me to check up on me and asking how my day was, or if i had any problems today. If we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then i bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place. Bullying wouldn't be a problem anymore; neither would cyer space or the drugs and alcohol. You need to step up and show your children that doing those things are not exceptable or nessesary in any life. Remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex, drugs, and profanities.     So, the next time you think that your going to buy a dvd or a cd preview it before you buy it. Make sure that if your child listened to it that it wouldnt be hurtful or have any profanities in it. Make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong. Lets make these profanities go away on their own. If they aren't something you want your child to listen to then you shouldn't listen to it either",0
"It was patient waiting to go to CAPS1. It went through NUM1 appointments. It was so excited and had the ladies to wait patiently and do many achievements and other activities respectively.

"I find that computers are very useful. They help people in many ways. They let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach hand eye cordination, and let you meet people online. First, people can learn about what is going on around the world. I can find out what is happening where I live by looking up your newspaper. Other people can find out about places they might go. They can find out what the weather is like so they know how to puck when going places. Also, if one of your employees is going camping they can look up a good place to camp and they can look up what kind of dangers there is when you camp so they can avoid them, because if they get sick they can't work. As you can see computers are important. Next, computers teach hand eye ncordination. Many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands. Lets say one of your printers break down so you call someone to come fix it. They must be able to work well with their hands to fix it. Now lets say the wiring in your lights get messed up. So you call an electrician has to be good with his hands to be able to work with small wires. Both of these people are good with their hands and they could of become that way by using computers. As you can see, computers are important in today's life. Lastly, computers let you meet new people online. Lets say you are all alone after a hard day of making newpapers. You could go online and meet new people in chat rooms and online games. Now lets say that one of your employess just broke up with his girlfriend and he is sad and lonely, so she isn't working as well. He could go on an online dating site and meet the perfect girl. Now when he comes to work he is happier and making more papers and if he makes more papers you make more money. As you can see computers are very important. In conclusion, computers are wonderful machines. They can let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach people good hand eye cordination and let people neet new people online.",0
"well so does sports and just playing. My last reason is that people argue that it is some thing that helps you learn about people and far away places, but books CAPS2 the same thing. I know alot of people feel that computer have good effects but the truth is they have bad ones. First, people spend more to on the computer than they CAPS2 exerciseing. People rather stay inside and play games on the internet then go outside and play tag or any sport. On a talk it was said that, ""In LOCATION1 people are alot over wieght"", and it was also said that the number of over wieght people in the world was the of LOCATION2"". So I believe that people should get of the computer and exercise. Secondly, people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so CAPS2 sports. Instead of being on the computer learning hand eye. You could be out side learning hand eye coordination. Again instead of just sitting at the computer your outside running around haveing fun while you learn hand eye coordination. My last reason is, that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people, but they have books for that too. People rather look stuff up on the computer but as soon as they're finsh the start playing games or the computer. Also some of the information might not even be true. Because people hack sights all the time and change things but you can't hack a book. The only thing you can CAPS2 to change it is to rip out pages and that only waste your money to a new book. So I believe that books are more reliable. Now is the time to make your disicion. CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects. I believe that computers have bad effect on people. Other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to about other place then the computer. Most importantly people should spend more time exerciseing the they CAPS2 on the computer. Now it time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know.",0
"When I walk into a library to look for a book, I would love to do so without seeing inappropriate books, movies, or magazines. When I see that, I  think, 'CAPS1 if a child saw this?' I would like a library for my child to visist without me worrying about the things they could see.To fix this problem, the libraries could do a number of things.     First off, the libraries could censor CAPS1 they put out on the selves. By putting the adult books section by the check out place, an employee at the library could easily find any small children wandering into that section. If that soultion does not work, then try and rate the sections like we rate movies. Put CAPS2 books and movies together, CAPS2- DATE1 books and movies together, CAPS4- CAPS5 books and movies together, and so on.      One time, when I took my baby brother to the library, he decided to bring me an adult book with a nude woman on the cover and asked if he could check it out. I was shocked and embarrassed. I did not think that that kind of thing would happen at a public library, but it did.     I believe that everyone should have the option of finding the book or movie of their choice. So I do not wish to have any inappropriate books or movies removed, but placed in better order so that children are not going to see that kind of stuff.",0
"The mood of this memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez's parent both move to LOCATION2 from Cuba to give their children a better life than what they had. Narciso's parents lived in a one room house untill they moved to New Jersey, were Narciso grew up. Inside that home the family created a beautiful Cuban communitie. The heart of the house was the kitchen. Where they played Cuban music all the time. The part of New Jersey were the Rodriguez family lived was filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants. The community was like a big family, ""the cultures cam together in great solidarity and friendship."" All of these cultures that came together really showed Narciso what a ""family"" really means. She never would have know what that ment or have had these oppertunities if her parents hadn't been selfless. They came here and had to start their lives over. As Narciso says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""",0
"laughter is the best medicine,well that is what some people say. I think that laughter is good for you and if you are in a relationship laughing is really good for that. CAPS1 here are some of the ways laughing is good for you. laughing in a relationship is good because if you can't laugh together you probably not be together. If you can't laugh with your boyfriendgirlfriend you will not have a very good relationship with himher. CAPS1 don't be scared to laugh a little with your boyfriend or girlfriend. I think and I think most people will say the same thing to that if you want a good relationship you need to laugh.laughing is good when you are sad because you can get told a joke and if it is a good joke it can make you feel better.It works at school to you laugh with your friends and all your stress will go away.if we all just laugh about more things and not take things CAPS1 sonorously we would not have CAPS1 many bad stuff happen in the world. we will all get along better and not get in fights in school,wouldn't have CAPS1 many people in jail or person,   CAPS1 that is why i think laughter is the best medicine for people who are sad,stress,and in relationship. But you think what you want but this is what i think is good about laughing.",0
"CAPS2 people at my school sit on there computers after school. They don't go outside and enjoy nature. Visit with family and friends or even exercise. CAPS2 people are affected by this. Going outside can enchance your knowledge, you can go on a walk in the woods. When you are on your walk you CAPS2 find interesting new species.

"In the DATE1 of NUM1' I spent two weeks at my aunt's house. At the time my cousins were living with her. My cousins and I are very close so we liked to spend time together. On evening we decided to watch a movie. I remember it was called my bestfriend's girl. So we started to watch the movie and it was super funny, we laughed constantly through out it. My cousin named PERSON1 has an awesome laugh, everytime he started to laugh I couldn't help but laugh too. We watched the movie and afterwards we went to go get some food. We were all in a very good mood, making jokes and doing crazy things to make each other laugh or be funny. My cousins would change their voices, making then higher or lower repeating lines from the movie or just making things up. That night we ate ORGANIZATION1. When we got back to my aunt's house none of us were tired so we decided to watch a late night program called CAPS1 CAPS2. It was a program composed of a bunch of short cartoons. They were all very funny. We would make fun of them and laugh and mimic what the characters did.  We stopped watching it at about NUM2 in the TIME1, I was very tired but my cousins were not. For awhile we just sat on the couches and talked, continuing to make jokes and say stupid things that would make us laugh. About a hour later we all fell asleep and continued to watch movies and just hang out for the two weeks while I was staying there. It was probably the best time of that DATE1. I was very happy and enjoyed my DATE1 because of my two cousins and the time we spend together. I laughed so much that my stomach would hurt all the time, but I didn't care because I was happy. I still spend time with my cousins and laugh a lot. I believe that our time spent together and shared laughter has brought us closer and more involed in each others lives. A person who can laugh, knows how to have a good time, and is fun to be around.",0
"CAPS2 our technology advance, so do are lives. Computers are a perfect way to better our way of life in ways that are benificial to us and future generations.

"There are alot of things that people think do do we really think that things that are found offensive in the libraries should be tooken down. I think that if there is somthimg foumd offincive in a library, it should be tooken down immediatley.     Libraries should be a place of comfort, a place to relax, a place to read and enjoy our books not a place were if we find somthing disturbing or offensive we shouldnt come there any more. Some people might not care about the things they see and some do. Therefore if i see somthing that offends me and is disturbing to me i will ask nicely if it could be removed from the list and book files.     Now to sum it all up if a book or whatever it MONTH1 be offends you in the library, then i believe it should be removed from that library. If people find things less attracctive and offensive it will soon go around and less people will come to that library. This is how i put it, make the library suitable for others, make them feel at home when they are reading there book, magazine, etc., not for you. It is how others think about what is out there in these libraries not what you think",0
"The features of the setting made the cyclists ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it Over on long, crippling hill. The word crippling is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclists ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding.",0

"Laughter. Some might think of it as just a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality laughter can be many things such as a way to cope with situations, a way to express yourself, or just a simple way to enjoy yourself when you are around friends. For me the meaning of laughing has changed a lot during my lifetime, when I was younger I used to laugh to enjoy myself or just to have fun with peers, but as I have grown older I have used laughter to cope with situations. On DATE1 the morning of my NUM1 birthday I found out some disturbing and disappointing news, that day I found out that my mom had passed away. When I first found out I didn't know what to do the only thing that I felt I could do was cry and grief about it and shut down into a depressed stage, many of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me that ""things were going to be okay"". I knew they were right, but the only thing I could think was even if things turn out okay things will never be the same. At this time I thought to myself what will CAPS1 be like? what am I going to do on mothers day?, and my biggest question of all how was I supposed to celebrate my own birthday?. It's hard knowing that someone that I love and had been with for NUM2 years of my life is gone, but since my mom has passed away I have tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like graduating high school, becoming successful, and not letting my life spiral down hill. Even though everyday for me is hard I still try to push through it and just remember that my mom wouldn't want me to give up on my life over her passing. You might ask yourself how I am coping with this loss, and the answer to that is that I have learned to cope with my situation with laughter. Growing up my mom always told me that ""laughter is the best medicine"". And after losing her I realized that that statement was true.Now whenever I get upset or sad I remind myself to think about the memories that I have had with my mom and laugh about the good experiences and times we had , and I sometimes even find myself laughing at some of the arguments we had. Laughing has been helping me cope fairly well in the past four months since my mom has passed away, and I hope it continues to help in the future, but I continuously think that ""sure I can laugh about things now, but what about in ten years?"" I guess the future is just going to remain a mystery for that, but one thing I do know about my future is that I will become successful, and even if laughter doesn't always work for me I will stay strong and be sure to live my life the way I would if I still had my mom, it will be hard doing it without the guidance and authority of having my mother there, but fortunately I am not dealing with any of this alone.One person that has been there through the whole situation has been my aunt, she has been in my life since day one, my mom and I even lived with her. I am grateful that my aunt has been there for me during my life, if she wasn't I don't know where I would be right now, she has taught me that I can't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because I don't have my mom, but to live life to the fullest and live the life my mom would have wanted to see me live, she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is okay and to not keep things bottled up and I am very happy I have someone to go through this with.Having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me. Knowing that I have someone to go to and just talk about the past and be able to have someone to laugh with about it. Laughing is hard when you do it by yourself but one thing that I have noticed is that when you have friends and family that are going through the same situation as you it is easier to share your feelings and I think it also makes it easier to laugh when you have people that you are close to and people that care about you around. In some situations laughter might not be the best thing to do, but the best advice I can give to someone who might happen to be going through a similar situation is to not stop living your life and be something great and try to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends.",0

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that there wasn't a lot of room for them to land. The length of them was the same as four blocks in New York City. They also needed to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment. They did lots of experiments and tests on dirigibles. It was also dangerous to have them land there. It was also bad for the enviroment because hydrogen is used and it's is highly flammable. Dirigibles can't dock there because it wasn't stable and that makes it not safe for people.,0
Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock.,0

"When constructing a mooring mast, CAPS1 ran into many problems. Safety was the main problemconcern they ran into. Since most blimps outside of the LOCATION1 were hydrogen not helium, they were very flammable. After Hindenburg blimp was destroyed by a fire, people in CAPS1 feared that would happen by the empire state building. Another problem they ran into was the law. At that time, it was the law that you couldn't fly an airship that low over urban areas. When tested, some blimps couldnt get close enough because of the heavy winds. This made it impossible to tie blimps up and let people off It also made people fear that the wind would blow the blimp onto sharp parts of other building which would put a hole in the blimp It was a good idea, but there were just to many obstacles they had to go around to make the blimp docking station and mooring mast successful.",0

"The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time. What I find appropreate, another MONTH1 find obscene and volgur. What I enjoy to read, or listen to, or watch, or any other manner of media consumption I indulge in, MONTH1 insult or bother someone else; as a matter of fact it probably does. That still does not make it right to remove what I, or others like because it offends another person.     A child walks through a grocery store, doesn't get what they want and proceeds to drop the f-bomb. More than half the time, they heard that language from their parents. If not their parents, then the media right? Maybe so, but that media shouldn't be hidden for the 'just-in-case' a child hears it. If a parent or guardian does not want their child to hear such things, they shouldn't allow them to listen to it. They control what does and does not enter their house.      To remove such things from the library, would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body, or hearing a curse word. Every time they bathe they'd need blinders from themselves and they'd never be able to leave their house, because people do not always watch what they say in public.      No, I do not feel like every type of movie, or book, etc., belongs in the library. There is a cut-off as to how inapropreate or volgure something should be and still be allowed in a public library. Novels that are so descriptive that the reader can almost see every aspect of the procreation taking place between the pages, should have its own place, seperate from the public library, right along with the movies that really do show every aspect.     Although I like the thought, to actually remove said books would be unfair. To deny access to those who find those books fine for themselves wouyld be wrong. A wise author, Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The truth of this statement would not be hard to prove.      A religious family that believes PERSON2, a book I find to be innocent fantasy, is a book series promoting witchcraft and satanism, so they remove them from the library. I remove the previously stated graphic romance novels. A mother whom wants her child to be sheltered from what she considers the filth of the planet, removes books of drug addicts, and abuse, and books of war because they're full of death. And as this continues, finally, we are left with the empty shelfs of a forgotten building that no longer has a purpose.      The graphic novels I find inapropreate could be placed in an adult section, or higher up than most children can reach. The protective parents can deny their own children the media they deem inappropreate, instead of the world.     Although not everything is appropreate for everyone, it isn't right to censor something from the world. There are ways to cencor things to parts and not others. Nothing should be romoved from the library because of its content. At most it should be placed in a less accessable manner.",0

"CAPS1 has been brought to my attention that some people feel that computers are bad for us. Some people say that they are a distraction to our physicaland mental health. Although I can see how some people would think this, I believe that computers are a good benifit to all society. I believe this because computers can help people learn, stay intach with friends or family that live faraway, and stay orginized. Sometimes people are on the computer, learning and they don't even know CAPS1. Simply by visiting the ORGANIZATION2 homepage, you automaticly see the news feeds of things happening around the world. Other times people go online diliberatly to learn. If someone is thinking about going to LOCATION1 then they would probably go on the internet to learn about CAPS1. Simply by searching equadore many choices will pop up you climate, sesonal weather, hotel options, and other farts. But thats not the only way people are learning on the internet. Now, many college students have the option of taking their lessons online. This is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class. Friends could be a big distraction in class, but how can you stay intouch with your friends if they moved away? I remember in second grade my bestfriend, LOCATION2, move away. I was so sad. I badey ever talked to her, but then one day our parents set us up on a vidio chat! I felt like I was right their with her! This was great, and I though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends. Another great way to stay intouch into friends and family is through e-mail. By writing a message and sending CAPS1 can make staying in touch so easey, and your personal wants can chat and emails are a easey thing to send world wide. So many people love to type on a keyboard as well, but so many different papers that you type could be lost. I, for me, hate clutter, and I have so many school binders for papers to be lost in. This is why I take great advantage of typing my paper every chance I get. My computer keeps me orginiced because I could never loose my work. File save, is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place. Then all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy. I am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason. Also, I myself am a much faster typer than I am writer so my work is a lot needey on the computer. As you can see their are plenty of reasons why using a computer is goof for our society you can learn, stay intouch with friends and family, and stay orginiced. Many people, could agree with me. Don't you?",0
"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obsticles. One obsticle, for example, was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were very large, some spanding NUM1 feet, therefore in a city of buildings, there were not many suitable areas to land. Another obsticle they had overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to rural areas. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. NUM2-paragraph NUM3). All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic.",0
"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were problems such as strong winds a weak structure and public safety. The strong winds would almost make it imposible to hold it steady at the top while the weak structure would almost make it imposible to hold saflley at the top. with all of these hazards it is compleatly unsafe for people to ride, dock, and board these massive dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable."" (NUM2) CAPS1 the Hindenburg which blew up, if a Blimp blew up over downtown New York, tons of lives would be lost, a huge risk to the mooring mast.

During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders had to face many CAPS1 in attempting to allow driggibles to dock there.     In the reading selection The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it discusses many of the CAPS1 that were faced. For an example an obstacle they had to face was finding a landing area because there was a huge lack of suitable landing area in New York City. The second CAPS1 they faced was how to make dirigible's global so they had a meeting with the president of a formed airship transport company would use the dirigable's service across the pacific ocean. The architects had meetings with the government about safeways of mooring airships to this mast.     The builders went through many CAPS1 to use the dirigibles but eventually it wasn't enough to Put the Plan into affect.,0

"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". This is stating that the stress of the dirigibles and its shiftyness will put stress on the buildings foundation and they don't want that stress to topal over the building. Also they say ""The winds on the top of the biulding were consistantly shifting due to the violant air current"". this says that they are worried  that the wind might take the balloon away from the building causing it to injure people these are only a few obsticals the builders had to face.",0
"Builders had to face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle is that it is unsafe to have it dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians. The dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether and that would add a lot of stress on the buildings frame. Another big obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Over MONEY1 would be needed for this to happen.",0
The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didnt have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. the speed limit was NUM1. One more thing is make sure you dont listen to a gentleman that is old and hadnt be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist.,0
"CAPS1 is laughter important? In my opinion, laughter is very important! How could laughter affect someones life? If there was any, or not? Also, CAPS1 is laughter important to me? Laughter is important for so many reasons. In a relationship, every day life, and with the ones you have in your life. How would the world be if there wasn't any laughter in this world? It would be very dry and dull. It helps connect people together, if they have the same sense of humor. Having a good sense of humor is very important these days. A lot of people use sarcasm which isn't ""laughter"" but to some people it could be or some could feel hurt by it. However, most people that feel hurt by it,don't have a sense of humor in any way, shape or form. Most people have heard the saying, ""it takes more muscles to frown then smile,"" that is a very true and factual fact! Having a glorious relationship is the best thing with my significant other. The affectionate that he can be by sharing our laughter together, brings us closer to a point where we couldn't be at all if there wasn't for laughter and communication. Having a a sense of humor is a important thing in a relationship, to most people. CAPS1 would you want to be with someone who bores you? Who CAPS2't make you laugh when your sad? I sure wouldn't want that. Laughter brings out great communication skills, by laughing with someone it shows your type of opinion on the subject you are talking about. In a relationship, could you imagine if there wasn't no laughter in it? Would you feel the same about the person your with if there isn't any laughter? How would you feel knowing the person you love isn't very ""humorous"" and CAPS2't like to laugh often? I couldn't handle that. I would want to love someone who is very funny with a great sense of humor.  Laughter is important to me for so many reasons. I would rather be around very ecstatic people then someone who brings me down! I consider, laughter to be one of the most important things in my life, and in my relationship with my significant other. It brings us closer. People ask, "" CAPS2't it ever get old being happy all the time?"" ""Of course not!"" I would say in defense. CAPS1 would someone think that way? Being in a phenomenal mood all the time, would be the most amazing place I would want to be in my life and with my partner.  In my opinion, I would think that almost everyone would feel close to what I'm saying. However, people have their own opinions about laughter and how and CAPS1 it's important, there are titled to their opinion. I know a few people, that don't like to be in a very cheery mood, that would prefer to be sad all the time and not care. Laughter could raise you up from that!",0
"There are many setting that affect the cyclist. One feature would be the terrain around him. Also, the obstacles faced by the cyclist. Another feature would be the types of wild animals & scarceness of water around . Also, the old man who gave him unimportant & non-updated information. All of these would affect the cyclist because it would  wear & fear on his physical & mental strengths.",0
"The author of Narciso Rodriguez creates an enjoyably, happy, fun mood.  The author makes every little sentence sound like you actually lived there & or were there at some point. The whole second paragraph is wonderfully written it makes me feel like I honestly was the experiencing his home & the love & kindness of his home. The love & friendship CAPS1 shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph & as well as the other ones too. CAPS1 shows so much love & thanks to his family & friends & his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph. Yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence. ""I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home."" CAPS1 also especialy shows how hard his parents worked to stay up but still did so much to care for everyone else, all right in paragraph NUM1.",0
"In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first town that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist chuckled and moved on, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached the fork of sorts twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilbers fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old mens directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel CAPS1 of champions by PERSON1, one of the characters named ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely.",0
"One day I had to wait about NUM1 hours which seemed like a year, but I didnt complain. I sat in the doctors office waiting to get called, I sat there and waited with my mom. I sat and read a magazine while my mom terted her freind. About three people got called in fourty- five minutes. But I sat and looked at the magazine. They called a kid whos name was PERSON1, and I thought it was me because my names PERSON2. I finished my magazine and went on to the next one. I thought I would like it because it had war on the front of the cover, but its just a cover nothing cool inside except a floating tranlula trick. About one hour passed and only five people were called. I finnally finished all the magazines and I was bored. I watched people get called and called finnally there were only my mom and I and another group, and of course they got called before us. It was about three hours till we were called, and when we did we had to wait even longer because they had technical difficulties with there machines. When we did get in we had to wait a half and hour for the doctor. But we got in, he made my knee twitch and then made me hop on one foot, why I dont know. But he did the regular put the thing that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue. But we finnally got out and went home. My mom asked me how could I be that patient, and I said, I have not a clue.",0
"CAPS1 do you feel about computers? I know that I think they are a great to we are lucky to have them. They have to be used in moderation though, because exercise and staying healthy is good. I hope you will share my opinions in your next article to help pursude readers on my view of computers. What I believe is the best thing about computers, is that it is a great source to learn. The internet can connect all over the world, and you can learn about other cultures. You can know everything about that country without ever visiting! Or you can use it to find out about you family's history. Many record keeping systems are switching to computers now. When we took a field trip to LOCATION1 they had data bases there that had every name of the people that went through there. Studies show that NUM1 people find the internet easy to use, and quicker than any method. Another thing about computers is they help you in the work place. Lets say you had a job designing houses to be built. In old times you would have to draw it out by hand using numerous instruments and tools, but now you could make the design using just one tool, the computer. It is a much away way to to you job and if assists the customers because before if the wanted the house to be a different you would have help to draw it all over again. Now you just have to make an ajustment on the computer and in seconds its done with the new design. These day if not PERCENT2 then PERCENT1 of house designers use computers. Computers also play in a social role. On the internet you can connect and chat with friends. Also you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game DATE1 to keep memories. Or you can send them a website with a really funny video of someone getting with a soccerball. Experts did a study and it showed that NUM2 times the reason a teen goes on the internet is to connect with friends. ""CAPS2 PERSON1 (computer expert and developer) what do you think the number one reaso teen use computers teen use computers is?"" CAPS3, I would have to say to chat with friends. I dont see why they wouldn't, it's simple and almost in ."" Computers are, a great advancement in our technology. They assist us in everyday life, life and make difficult tasks simple. They should not be over used though and you need to keep a healthy mind and body. All of the thing we could learn from them though help in the argument of that. To me the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was. Computer source found PERCENT3 of in LOCATION2, and. I believe they will be in all of our homes. Some families find them CAPS2 useful the have more than one in the household. They can come in all shapes and sized to fit your wants and needs, and can connect you to anything in the world.",0
There are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. They let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes. Another reason why computers are so important is we can talk to our family without having to even travel if they live in another country or another state or even if they are your neighbors. Lastly they teach us hand-eye cordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life. The fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home. People of all different countries MONTH1 be inquestitive about where they came from. They MONTH1 also wonder how other countries are doing goverement wise or even economic (stocks). All of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel. Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. The marvelous things about computers is the speed of them. You could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes. However if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes you life much easier and the faster you can look up somes part of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air. Also radios and television stations might be a little of with their accuaracy. Maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one-hundred points or go down one-hundred points. This is all valuable information that people would want to be one-hundred percent accurate. Secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state. With webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them. My grandma was in the hospital once and I wasn't allowed to see her since I was to young. Since the technology of webcams were invented I was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life but at least i was able to see if she was doing okay. Webcams are a could way also in discussions. Such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can't tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight. If you have a webcam you can talk to eachother on the computer and see if she is being sarcastic or not. Technology MONTH1 be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and MONTH1 be the best one that will ever be made. That last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand-eye cordination. Hand-eye cordination is an important skill that is acquired. This is an important skill because it allows you to suceed in life such as having to write. This skill is also important if you have a job that invloves computers because you need to know how to type and move you fingers fast if you want to suceed in this well payed job. This skill also helps provide a wide range of other suceesful jobs in the world. Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. If you don't have a good hand-eye cordnation you should get a computer because it will help a lot. however if you get a computer you must update it reguarly so you computer will not become slow and start crashing on you. In conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world. It allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally. Also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in. Lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand-eye cordnation. Everyone in the world should be able to have a computer so that they could obtain the knowledge that they would nedd to suceed in life.,0
"Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we MONTH1 have never thought about before.  However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read?  Well think what you MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts.  Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be.  Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right.     Even education DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people?  If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library?  Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning.  These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyones benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education.         Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them.  With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better.  Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for.  The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics.  Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well.     Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in LOCATION1,and hopefully globaly someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit.  People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance.  Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have DATE1.  Harry CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them.  Would he have become such a hit if others didn not believe this as well?  To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed.       People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies.  These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives.  Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it.  We all certainly would not be the people we are DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only dehabilatating ourselves.   These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever",0
"Would you censor the CAPS1? i CAPS2 i sure would not. The CAPS1 is a very percious and religoius part of our nation and history, but this is just a mere example. There are thousand of books, newpapers, articles, and media that play and important role in the history and the future of human beings.     Common sense or also referered as common knowledge is something that we dont pick up outa no where. We absoub it thought this that do, see, and read. An example is the 'The CAPS4 CAPS5' this is a book of a CAPS5 that meets a young boy and the CAPS5 is just thrilled to be of purpose for the boy. Throught out the story the CAPS5 gives the boy its apple, its branches, and even its trunk. but the CAPS5 is happy. at the very end of the story they former young boy is now a old man that just wants a place to rest so the CAPS5 straightens up his stumb and is just happy with CAPS4 the old man his happiness. Now would you censor that?! That story reflects that helping someone is a key to life. That CAPS4 someone else happiness is the true gift of life.      Now relegion is something that is censored alot these day... Why?! The CAPS1 for example is just a book full of short stories that ties together. Indivigle tha stories are just little reminders of right and wrong,  kindness and jelousy. Its doesnt say if you have to follow every word and every sentence by day and night. its just helpfull advise, And really who has not asked someone else for advice? CAPS8 relgion on tv, in schools, and everywhere else is telling us we dont need relegion for us to be productive and honest. Me coming from a roman catholic and christian background have never really went to church or read the CAPS1 am swelled up about relegion. Thanks to a close friend.     CAPS8 could also be good at its points though. For an example CAPS8 adult type content from minors is helpfull sence little kids dont CAPS2 much of anything. They just go with the flow. Another example is CAPS8 mail sent to different countries. This helps keep our country safe from invasion and war.      so i will say that CAPS8 can be a good thing but too much of it can be bad. Such as CAPS8 relegious content, or CAPS8 classical book that teach you common knowledge that will help aid you in the future. This stuff is something that should be CAPS10 by ages and ages to come!",0
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are: CAPS1 they choose dirigible instead of balloon, because the fabric used in dirigibles is lighter. Second, their extended use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area and think about the safety of passengers get in or get off",0
"Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldnt have. Well of course I think that there are some books, music, movies, magazies, that young children should not read about, hear, or watch. These kind of things affect our every day living.      Lets start off with a book that has killing in it. I'm not a parent at the time, but I know for a fact that I would not wan't my children reading about that kind of violence. Thats not something that a twelve year old child should be reading about. Those kind of books could get kids thinking oh he killed someone why couldn't I, and thats how some kids grow up to be bad and have to go to jail at the age of NUM1, because they have killed someone or tried at least. There also other books that some children shouldn't read about and that MONTH1 be about slavery. If a mother doesn't want their child to know about slavery at the age their at there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten year old to read about. I mean if I had family members that lived in the slavery days i for sure wouldn't wan't my kids to read about it, because that shows how white people disrespected the blacks and that could have an affect on that child. That could cause them not to like white people.     Second is the music. I know that most libraries don't have all that bad music that is on the radios, but I'm sure there is some music that has something about steeling on it. Thats aother thing that could give kids the wrong idea and send them on the wrong track again. There's just some things children shouldn't hear unless their with one of their parents, and then that parent could explain to them that you shouldn't do what the song says. But they shouldn't be in our school or public libraries.     The third thing is movies. There should not be any movies of killing, breaking in peoples houses or fighting at any sircumstance in a school library. School is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things. That just gives a young child the wrong kind of idea, and isn't approperiate for schools to have.     The last one is magazines. There should notbe magazines at school of women in their bathing suits or men with out shirts on. That could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble.     Thats what I think about the books, music, magazines, and movies in a library.",0
"The cyclist in Rough Road CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit starts off in the serenity of an easly summer evening taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didnt mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his short cut was not so short after all. The high deserts of California in June and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the hed be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a Welchs Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.",0
"There are a bunch of very good book sat a public libary, you can get all kinds of different types of books. You are get a book on anything you really need, any facts you need to know or anything you want to know how to do, I'm sure there is a book out there that can help you out. Just because a book is an opion dont mean it needs to be taking off shelves. Everone looks at everything differently.     If you read it can help you in many different ways, you can learn alot just from reading a book. Me personally i hate reading, so i dont learn much. I'm more of a hands on type of person, words just fly through one ear and out the other really. It is really have to understand when im trying to read and listen or write an listen i lose my thoughts to easily",0
"Libraries are a place that provides people of all ages the oppurtunity to read any book, watch any movie, or listen to any music all for free and for a certain period of time.  When people grow up, they tend to start reading, watching, and listening to material that they would never let their children listen to.  Since books are read privately and movies and music are played publicly, books should not be taken from the shelves and only very bad movies and music should leave the library.     Books have always been a way for people to get away from their life and into their own story world.  Normally when people read a book, they don't read it in a group unless they are in a reading group discussing certain books.  If someone wanted to read a book that was innappropriate for their children, let them do it; it's not hurting the children that they have been reading innappropriate topics, it will only hurt them if that child finds the book that should have been hidden in a better place.  For example, PERSON1 read the book 'The CAPS1 CAPS2', which had some innappropriate content for a child in there, but not so bad that it would be heinous.  PERSON1 will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children; this scenario is how it should be.  Although, if a library is putting adult books near children's books, they need to redesign to keep kids from accidentally walking into the adult section.  Books can be kept from kids if hidden well enough, but movies and music can not be hidden in the same manner.     Movies and music are a great way to kick back and relax after a long day, unless your kids are around.  Keeping kids out of the room is a near impossible task, whether it is actually watching the movie or hearing the movie through his bedroom wall.  Music can of course be listened to through headphones, but what happens when you leave a CAPS3 is left in the car and a child is sent in that car to wait for his parents to get in?  The parents might tell their child to start the car for them and the music will be playing away.  The movies and music were from the library, a place where the child thinks that there would never be something such disgraceful material as what their parents are watching and listening to, ruining their good thoughts of the library.  Libraries need to either get rid of all nasty content pertaining to movies and music or if their main business is that and can't seem to give it up, just put the content as far away as possible from the children.     As said above, libraries need to remove all content that has potential to be exposed to children and destroy their innocent minds.  Libraries are a place where kids can have fun picking out whatever book they wish to read, not a place where parents can pick up items that might spoil that child's brain",0

"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a combonation of calm, nice, and happy. It could also be described as heavenly.Narciso reffers to his childhood like it was one happy dream. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". He also mentions how greatful he is to his parents. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". One last fact that contributes to the mood of this memoir, is Narciso's view on family. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"".From this excerpt it is clear that the author cherish this time, and would love to go back.",0
"Proven by PERSON2 the best CAPS1 major over PERCENT1 of children either have desktops, laptops, or some type of internet access. What so you think about this? Well I the computers are takeing up people time (like children) and not letting them get their work done. Also, computer are not only letting people talk to their friend, but its causing CAPS5 bullying. Finally, CAPS1 are also just maken parents more stressed out because the have to pay another bill for internet. Children now and days come home change and log right into the computer and start talking to friends and lisening to music all this sounds good intell their report cards come back and they see they are failing half there classes. I remember when my friend CAPS3 would go home change eat and log right inside the computer. As days went around the end or the year was she noticed she had two problems. She was getting over weight and she was failing all her classes. She noticed that getting on the computer was not neccesary so for the next mouth and a half she cut down on her time on the CAPS1 did her homework and started this pushed me to beleave that children have CAPS1. Proven by PERSON3 the syber bully that over PERCENT2 of children have bin syber bullyed or CAPS5 bulllied someone. All this happen when children are not being watched or get bored and to pick on someone. What should we do people ask PERSON1 and she says well take away the CAPS1.

"The obstacles that builders faced at the empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there are. The possible dangers of having something fall on them.

If one caught fire while moored to the top of the Empire state building the results would have been catastrophic because it would happen over a densly populated area. Another obstacle was wind.

"So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books throught a library, she chucks CAPS4. You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away. You go and pick up the book, CAPS4's about medical marijuana. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say, if CAPS4's on the shelf, CAPS4 stays on the shelf.     I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a CAPS1 library, shut your fat mouths. A library serves many purposes, one, CAPS4's CAPS1, itt's open to anyone and everyone. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc. Three, if your walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave.      What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you can just taking away part of the heart. Let's say you have NUM1 CAPS1 libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have. Someone riots and they get to take CAPS4 off the shelf. Your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy CAPS4 off line. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get CAPS4 free at a library?      But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelfs. Say you gotta NUM2-year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book. What can you say about that? I mean in sounds corny but CAPS4 can happen. Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless enviroment. That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a CAPS1 library?!' Then that's where CAPS4 goes bad.      After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians to CAPS2 they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid. But CAPS4's not the librarians' fault, different people like different books, that's CAPS2 a library has many, many choices when CAPS4 comes to books.      That's when the question comes up, 'CAPS2 don't we just have seperate rooms, for seperate books?' CAPS3, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for CAPS4? Libraries get donated alot of their stuff, they are profitable, but then again a non-profitable resource. Libraries have been around for ages, most of them started out small and now are big. That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need. They make money off that, that's when they start making seperate rooms.     CAPS4 sounds crazy, but CAPS4 wouldn't cause a riot to go on about people. Therefore, people are happy, librarians happy, and most of all you are happy. You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three. All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for CAPS4, check CAPS4 out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime. CAPS4 sounds easier that looking CAPS4 up, get the dewy decimal number, find the number.      All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf bevause CAPS4 MONTH1 be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country. You never know. All I gotta say is, 'CAPS4's better to keep a book, than to forget a book.",0
"Have you ever wondered what life would be like without computers? Some experts are concerned that people are using too much time on the computers. I believe we should still use computers.

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welchs factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain.",0
"A time when someone else I know was patient was when my mom was looking for a job. My mom is very very busy. She was the president of a club named CAPS1-CAPS2 for about one or two years. But now that she is not the president anymore, she is less busy but still has an important position that requires a lot of work. But with either position, she wasnt earning only money. So she decided that she would get a job. She started looking for jobs online and in the newspapers and things. She couldnt find a job that was right for her. She never complained about it even though she was having a hard time finding a job. She kept on looking and looking. She kept looking for about another year until, finally she found a job at CAPS3.C.C. she now teaches a computer class for collage or older people. If she liked, she would have ended up with a job that didnt enjoy.",0

"I believe that it is unfair to ban ony sort of materials from the library.  It simply isnt right to withold information from your children.  Any information that they might read or hear is something that they are going to find out sooner or later anyway.  Wouldn't you much rather your children find out from reading it in a book or magazine or hearing it in a movie or cd?  Then they can ask parents any questions that they MONTH1 have about things they have read and heard instead of hearing it from a teenager in the hall or talking to a friend about it and being misguided and given the wrong information.     If your child is to read about sex or an affair in a magazine wouldnt you like to know?  Would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong.  Wouldn't it be much easier to know that your child is educated on certian things so that they know when things are false and they're not confused or worried about something small?     Any of the things that they MONTH1 read in a magazine or see in a movie are things that they could easily look up on the internet.  On the internet there are more graphic photos, and some websites give false information on subjects.  Your childs curiosity could take them to inappropriate websites.      When i was a child and I was curiouse my parents sheltered me from certian things. I found out what kinds of things they were trying to hide from me while I was only in NUM1 grade when high schoolers on my bus told me all about sex, showed me pictures and told me things that I would have much rather heard about in class or read.  I felt like I couldnt talk to my parents about these things.  I mean what would you do if your second grader came home form school and started talking to you about the kinds of things that they had heard on the bus.  What if the high schoolers had been lieing to me, I would feel stupid for saying anything about it because my parents wouldn't have understood what I was talking about.      What I'm saying is that understand that there are some things that a child should never be allowed to read, see, or hear.  It isn't fair to them that they don't get the opportunity themselves to learn about it and ask questions. Besides isn't it your fault in all reality if they get they're hands on somthing innapropriate for their age becuase they aren't getting the proper supervision?  If you feel that they are reading, listening, or watching something that you feel is in appropriate, ask questions.  Explain things to them when they ask you a question.  Don't beat around the bush.  Make sure that they know the difference between good and bad, right and wrong. It truely is not fair to take these things away from them when they don't even know why they are not allowed to look at it",0
One day we were in a line at cedar point for the speed racer. We had to wait for what seemed like forever. I was losing my patients so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot. I was standing and someone told and security took us back to the end of the line.

"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they had to make the Empire State Building taller. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor the for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow the passengers on or off the dirigible. The dirigibles were docked which meant that the electric winch, in which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless tower that would be illuminated from the inside. The roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Everything went as planned as the builders wanted tpo.",0
"CAPS1 everybody relizes, technology is getting more advanced every single day.

To start, Computers can help People comunicate just imagine someone on the other side of the world. you can use websites like CAPS3 and e-mail to quickly comunicate with typing.

"There were many obsticles the builders of  Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One obsticle was the buildings frame was not prepared for it. In paragraph NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The frame of the building could not handle a docked dirigible. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have had to be made. Another obsticle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to make there dirigible fly. Hydrogen was very flammable and builders figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a desely populated area like New York, it would be devastating. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the wind on top of the building that was constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currats. While the digarble were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles. They could not use lead weights to help hold the zeppelin steady because you can't just dangle heavy lead weights over New York City. From the beginning, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ridiculous.",0

In paragraph NUM1 the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" In paragraph NUM2 ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture.""

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new begining is starting  For example the fact that they moved to a different country. Thats what the author means when the spring comes. Spring represents a new life which is what Saeng & her mother are doing. Also the snow represents a blanked of the past  hard times. Last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. So if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts & then a new beginning when spring starts & the flower buds  That is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.,0
"In all of the times people paid a lot of attention to laughter. We can't imagine our lives without CAPS9. We CAPS8 every day, make jokes,smile. For me laughter always was one of the best things in the world! CAPS9 helped me so many times in the most difficult situations. I want to tell you one story of my life when laughter played a huge role.CAPS9 all started DATE1 in DATE2. I was living in LOCATION2 at that time and was trying to get a scholarship to go to the LOCATION2 for one DATE1 as an exchange student. To do this I had to pass a lot of tests, to write millions of essays, go through all the paper work... One of the things that i had to do was to talk to the group of other participants and two CAPS1 for about one hour. So, people who chose the kids to go abroad will look at how we can communicate with others. Can you imagine speaking foreign language with group of people who you have never seen before? No. Especially when all of you know that only one from the whole group will go to LOCATION1. You know that everyone will try to be the best, the leader, and hardly ever will let others to say something. But I still hoped everything would be fine.I remember that day as if CAPS9 was yesterday. Everything in details. CAPS9 was DATE3 TIME1, when I came into the white big building of ORGANIZATION1 where the competition was going to be.I came in the class and two CAPS1 introduces us to each other. And at that exact moment, when I saw other three people, at that exact second I realized that I actually had to worry! I saw their faces. They thought the same. We had nothing in common. At all. They all looked different. One girl was all in black. No kidding. black big shoes looked alike to old army ones that my grandfather has, black skirt was longer then the girl, black ties, dark t-shirt, three or four sizes bigger then the girl; you can not even imagine how dark her short straight hair were. She looked like if she was a part of the darkest night of the DATE1. Another girl was a complete ""barbie girl"". You know, typical CAPS3- two good for everyone. She was tall, thin, long blond hair and pink clothes. All pink. Bright-pink jeans, light-pink top and high heels. I remember her saying the girl in black something like "" CAPS4, I am the best one here"". Nothing else about her, just CAPS3. Also there was one boy. He was a wonderful example of rap person. All his look from shoes to attitude were just screaming about how much he likes rap. No, loves rap. Big blue jeans, cool in rep companies ORGANIZATION2 shoes, white tee-shirt with a face of popular in LOCATION2 rap musician, a hoodoo and a big hat. Also, he had a backpack and i was able to hear music from his I-pod. Well, me, I was in new green pants, grey top, black cardigan, nice grey purse and black flats.. I looked like a girl who loves style, I guess. I can not tell you what they thought about me. I just don not know. But I'm pretty sure that I was a person who just reads magazines all the time and watching CAPS6 fashion shows. So, we all looked super different from each other and seemed as we were interested just in our own thing. And in nothing else.I didn't understand how we were able to be in the same group. But we were. The first ten minutes were awkward. We did not know what to talk about since we all were so different. Two CAPS1 who were making notes on how how our conversation is going decided to help us.They gave us a random word, something like "" jungadzhumba"" and told us to think about what CAPS9 is and to perform CAPS9. That seemed to be an interesting thing to me but not for others. The girl-in-black said that CAPS9 is stupid. And then, the next second the thing that changed everything happened. The boy said a joke about CAPS9. Yes, just a joke, and i do not even remember what CAPS9 was, the only thing is that CAPS9 was really funny. We started to CAPS8. And the laughter helped us. We were talking so long, more than one hour, but CAPS9 seemed for us so fast! We were talking about everything in the world! So many topics, we were talking in that room, and then after in the restaurant, and in the subway on the way home... CAPS9 was wonderful time! That day is very important for me now, because at that day I realized that laughter is a key for everything. I've heard CAPS9 before, but the real understanding was at that DATE3. Now my favorite phrase is: ""CAPS8, if you don't know what to do, just CAPS8!"" CAPS9 will help you.",0
"CAPS1 that use computers is a good thing. I state this because the web has many things to do. For example, facebook, twitter, and myspace are all social sites. Also there are video sites such as youtube. Plus CAPS1 learn how to type fast. Social network sites are good for CAPS1. Teens got to talk to each other, make new friends, and post what they want. For example, twitter you can post tweets, facebook you can join groups, and become a fan of something or someone, and myspace you can send messages. TEENS relieve a lot of stress on the web. Videos are great when your bored. Type in youtube and get a good laugh or two. Teens that go on youtube become more social. For example, teens can learn the new dance. Plus on video sites there are comedy. Comedy helps daily life. CAPS2 helps life if you work in a office or a trademark. Teens learn to type to make life easier. For example CAPS2 fast is like texting. CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically. So get to CAPS2. Ok so computers do help life in teen years. Basically it is CAPS3 somewhat. All people should have a computer. Just remember that social sites, video sites, and CAPS2 make life better.",0
"Riding through beastly mountains, hot and burning deserts and no water. A cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions. The two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion. Maps are made for people to use so if you have a map you should trust it and in the ending it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said And I promised myself right then that Id always stick to it in the future.",0

The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen.

Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top. All I know is the lack of water can kill you if you get heatstroaks easily.,0
In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.,0
"To the CAPS1, I have recently heard that some people think that computers don't benefit society. However, I disagree with that. First, it allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. Also, it allows family and friends to connect with other family and friends. And lastly, it is a form of entertainment on a day that you can't go outside. Some people might not agree with me. However, I believe the computer wasn't a waste of thought. I think the computer is a benefits to society and the whole world. First, the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and, other things. People, professors, historians, and either highly educated people past discoveries and information about things everyday. That means everyday someone can learn something everyday of their life. When I do research on a important person in history, I learned things I never learned in school. The computer is the best way to allow people to put info they've learned for other people to see and gain knowledge of each other these are endless possibilities for everyone who owns a computer to learn. You wouldn't believe the things you can learn on a computer. Also, the computer allows family and friends stay in touch with other family and friends in far away places. If there was computers and someof your family moved to a diffrent. There wouldn't be an efficient way to stay in touch with them. The computer allows you to send e-mail to a families computer or celluar phones. The computer is the best way to stay close to your family even though they are far away. My brother is in LOCATION1 and every day I get on the computer when I get home and video chat with him. If there was no computer, I wouldn't be able to chat with my brother. Lastly, the computer allows a form of entertainment on a rainy day. Certain software gives people the chance to create games and post online to the public. When I can't go outside because of the weather I get on my computer and play video games. The games keep me company. I can never play with other people with online multiplayer. Some of the games are educational also. The games teach you different things about history.",0
"The mood described by the author in the memoir is a greatful and happy feeling I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, Always brings up how he is greatful for his partents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph NUM1, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, ""At tine when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great soidarity and friendship."" Even though there is racism, CAPS1 one is friends.",0

"not so many people think CAPS4 benefits society. Well, I CAPS5! I think this because the internet helps you connect with people you're looking for. The internet also gives you the advantage to shop online. If you don't have a CAPS1 system, you ca get directions online. If you read more you will see why I support these details. Have you ever heard of CAPS2 or CAPS3? Well incase you haven't CAPS4's a social networking site, CAPS4 helps you connect, chat and find people you are looking for. I have a CAPS2 and a CAPS3 and they're not that bad. They're actually fun. There is games you can play, quizzes you can take and you can chat with your friends. CAPS4's a great way to find someone you know in another town or even. This is one reason the computer is a good source. If there is ever a reason you can't drive to store or where ever you need to go to buy something, you can shop online and buy CAPS4! you can just type in the adress of the website and look at all the stuff they have and click what you want and buy CAPS4! They even have grocery shopping online. So next time your really upset that you can't go shopping, just shop online. ""CAPS4 might take a while to get your purchase items, CAPS4's worth the wait."" CAPS5 you have a CAPS1 system? well if you don't, don't worry! you can go online to a website such as www.mapquest.com. All you have to CAPS5 is type in the adresss where your starting from and then the adress where your going to. Then you can print out the directions so you won't be lost! Thats deffinatly an advantage! So, don't you think that the computer is a deffinate advantage to almost everyone? Well I CAPS5! you can use CAPS4 to find people you need to find. you can shop online and you can easly in less than finve minutes get directions! That's any almost everyone should use a computer.",0

"Have you ever forgot the book you needed for homework? Did you ever miss the newest episode of your favorite show? Well, all these things and more can be solved by using the computer. The computer gives us all the things we need. Whether that's information, games, or online friend chatting websites. The computer is necessary for our society today. Countless times I was in desperate need for information. If I'm doing a school report on animals. I can just go on the computer and search whatever I want. There's no more need for driving to the town library and then searching through countless books and encyclopedias. I just think that that is a waste of time, when you basically have everything you need twenty foot away. And it's in your house! There is no more need to search for hours through biographies. If you need to know state capitals, you can find it in no time. To me, that's a life saver. Not only can computers help you with information, it can make school projects so much easier. In my own experiences, I've needed pictures on school projects. Instead of drawing it, the internet can save time and effort. All you need to do is print out the pictures! However, if you have an essay that's, let's say, supposed to be ten pages who wants to write all that? With a computer, you can type it out in half the time. Then, when done, you can print it, or even send it straight to your teacher. But, if it's not finished, you can save it on a thumbdrive, and use it on any computer you want. All in all, that's a huge help. My final reason why computers are good, is that they serve instant pleasure. Computers have millions of games that a kid can play for free. Also, it has many website, like CAPS1, or CAPS2, that let you interact with friends. If you need to tell them something, there is no need for a phone. Plus, if you miss certain shows, or want to watch music videos, there are websites for that. As a kid, I'm usually never home because of sports and school activites. If I miss something on LOCATION1, it is almost definitely going to be on the computer. You don't have to wait a week or so before they replay that episode. Who wants to do that? In the end, I think computers benefit people around the world. No more driving to libraries, or going out and buying games. The computer has everything you want for free. Basically, I think the computer is a huge time and effort saver that every household needs. It definitely benefits society.",0
"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he sill loves it today. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."" (CAPS1. NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (CAPS1. NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (CAPS1. NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is. Only a person who is very thankful ""will never forget..."" something. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfullness.",0
"I think computers have a good effect on people and not a bad effect. I think this for three reasons. My first reason is that they relieve stress. Without a computer in my opinion things would be a lot more stressful. With a computer you can easily look things up without wasting time or being stressed out by having to look for something. My second reason for thinking computers have a good effect on people is technology. Without technology things would be so much harder. Without computers it would be harder to neatly type assignments, print out pictures, and getting information. If we didn't have technology as in computers I think a lot or things would go wrong. My third reason for thinking computers have a good impact on people is that without them factories would crash. i say this because if you think about it could in a factory is ran by some type of computer. Without that computer telling the machines what to do everything practically wouldn't work! without the computer everything would become so time consuming that no one would want to get the work done. These are my three reasons why I think computers have a good effect on people.",0
"If you walk into a store and see a book you dont like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? My answer to that is no you should not. You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you dont like it dont buy it or look.     When I was in the eighth grade I went to LOCATION2 for a church missions trip. There was alot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the LOCATION1. When we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping. There is alot of people in this city and it was packed all the time. Now with that being said there was alot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that i thought were very inappropiate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didnt belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. Our actions simply invovled nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. Reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. After we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw if we would have removed those items they wouldnt of got to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like meaning i'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that.     If you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just cant do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you.You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like too. Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like. That goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops.      So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks in the ame store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive. Now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off. This will cause alot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it one person doesnt. If you dont like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you.     These are some of my opinions about this catagory. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products. Always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause alot of lossed jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said",0
"I don't think computers benefit the society as much as every one thinks. When people spend most of their time on computers they don't have time to spend with their family, people don't excersise enough when they are on computers wich causes them to become obiese, and you MONTH1 meet up somewhere with a bad person you met in facebook or myspace. These are the main reasons computers don't benefit society. The number one reason computers ain't beneficial is because you need sometime to spend with your family. But, when you are on computers twenty-four-seven you have absolutly no time with your family and friends. I belive that families need to eat dinner together and have at least one hour with one another. Some good ways to spend time with your family is to play games together, go on a walk, or even go to a bike ride together. Did you know that computers have a medium sized effect on how people become obiese? If you are at school from seven till -thirty and after school you spend seven hours on your computer you will become fatter because you will have absolutly no time to excersise. When you just eat and don't excersise your body will not just burn off all that fat you ate. When you are on a computer you are probably go on to facebook or myspace. On these chating websites you can make arangments to go some where with someone you don't even know. If you meet up with them they could be a killer, a kidnaper, or a rapist. So there for you can litteraly die or get hurt because of your computer. Thats why e-mail is the absolute safest way to chat online if your were to have a computer. These are the main reasons why computers are not beneficial to the society. Also you MONTH1 not spend enough time with family or friends, you can become obiese because you don't have ""time"" to excersise and you can be kidnapt by someone you don't even know through facebook or myspace. How would you like it if you had no time with your family, you were obiese, and you got kidnaped because you met up with someone that thought was nice through facebook or even myspace?",0
"I think that my coach is patient because there are NUM1 girls she is watching . She has to teach us stuff that we dont know. Our coach has in teach us stuff like the CAPS1 play and teach us how to do moves like cross overs. She teaches us to run fast, she has to be patient with the slower kids that cant ran as fast. Our coach had to be patient when she was handing out jerseys because we all had to try them all and it for a little of her time , so she had to be patient.",0
"Come on I need some help. Sir please sit down. I will be writing about a time my CAPS4 took a suit to a tailor for a conference. Can you please find my suit. Sir we are trying our best, we might have given it to someone else on accident. I need that suit to go to my conference. Well sir what we can do is have you pick out another suit and we will have the tailor start imediently on your suit o.k. I like this one. What needs to be done asked the tailor pants are to be long. I will have it done in no time, CAPS1 me about two and a half hours thats when my plane leave for CAPS2. I will have it done in NUM1 minutes.

"CAPS1 computers become more and more a part of everyday life people begin to question wether or not they have a positive impact on people. Computers are a technological wonder that has a positive effect on people. The world wide web, unlimited socialization and simulations are just a few of the benefits of computers. The internet provides acess to the world wide we. Infinite amounts of information can be found on your computer. ""CAPS2 in almost everyday school rely on the internet to gain information stated education secretary, PERSON1. Also search engines provide acess to thousands of information loaded pages. In addition to unlimited information the web olds thousands of different web pages. With these people can learn about other peoples opinions or spend time playing games. The web is only one thing out of hundreds of great things about computers. Socialization is a huge of the moders life style. Web cames CAPS1 on computers allow people to talk with friends who live miles away. No longer will people have to take an airplane to talk with friends on the other side of the world. Also, instant messaging and email is the main comunication system for thousands of people. It is the most efficient way to talk to friends. In fact, I became re connected with a lot of people I didn't talked to in a long time by getting email. Every body loves taking with their friends and family and this is made easier by using computers. Simulations are a huge benifit of computers. Many simulation programs are used to help people in their lives. Many proffessions using simulations on computers to help learn hot to do their job nine out of ten medical schools have the use of surgery simulations CAPS1 part of their training course. Also, simulations and gaming on computers reveal interest for many people. I myself have a greater interest in history now after playing many historical themed computer games. Also many games and computer simulation have helped many people learn new things, CAPS3 are countless learning games and simulations that are acessable by computer. Simulations add huge benifets to owning a computer. CAPS1 technology advances people are opened up to many possibilities suck CAPS1 information via the web unlimited socialization and simulations. The benifits of computers are many and the problems few. So, how can you keep up in a world where computer users hold the advantage if you deny the benifits of computers? Computers affect people in a positive way.",0
"The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of california in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast. At one point he says, The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. CAPS1, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beggining to rum out of water.  The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage When your petalling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be      in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.",0
"I don't think a magazine should be taken off the shelves just because someone is offended. People get offended all the time but do you see them trying to get what ever it is that made them fell like that. I have been offended by cartoons before but you don't see me crying about it you just have to suck it up and go on with life. Cartman from the tv show LOCATION1 is the most offensive characters on that show. He uses every offensive language known to mankind.      He makes fun of all the racees, he says he hates everyone equally. But still you can't stop it that is like trying to get a dog to be a cat it just wont happen. It is also like trying to get rid of racecism. That is what I think about finding something offencive.",0
"I believe the author concludes the story with Saeng because it shows when she is reminded of home. I believe she thought she could pass the test when the flower was blooming and reminded her of home. For example, Saeng mumbled, Not like the kind we had before. This suggest to me that she was probably home sick. Then when spring comes and it blooms the flower could give her the strength to pass the test. This is why I believe the author ended with this paragraph.",0
"Materials that are offensive for some people in my point of view should not be removed from the shelves. If some people are offended by materials they shouldn't pay any mind to those certain materials. If everybody paid attention too offensive entertainment regardless to what kind, people would be upset all the time. There are many things people see, hear, and read about that MONTH1 be offensive. Don't take everything seriously most of those offensive things MONTH1 just be a joke or just someone trying to get attention.               When you just sit and think about it, most television shows you would watch everyday MONTH1 have at least one moment that's says something offensive. In example I watch a television show some nights that says something racial about CAPS1-CAPS2. I don't pay the show any kind of attention because I know it's a show their just trying to get more rating. So when it really comes down too it I am goin to be watching the same show again the next night.      What if some of our most historical people had listened to everything that everyone esle said about them. Then, our black culture and history wouldn't be so 'CAPS3' today. I probably wouldn't be able too take this test that im doing right now. So don't take everything so serious everyone has some type of  humor.     If we removed everything that was offensive today. Some of your favorite actors and singers wouldn't be the famous actors or singers you love and respect today. All of the grammy's and award shows that we watch on television would not be themselves. There are all kinds of different genre of music. Some of the words that different artists use would be offensive but they still release those same songs because they're only words.     My conclusion, is that anything and anyone can be offended or offensive. People don't take everything serious because it might just be a joke or some ignorant person that needs attention. When I was younger my mother always said 'sticks and stones MONTH1 break your bones but words only make you'. So don't take everything serious I mean it's only the media, tell me who does take them seriously",0
"To begin with, The learning ability people get from it has improved. The CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit. It helps learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need.",0

"What I do think is that they should keep everything in the library. Some people like to stay and read the newspaper and listen to music while out in the library. If you do think it's offensive, then don't read it or just pick out another book. Everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out.      What I think about all this stuff in the library these days are good for the kids so they can learn faster and have a lot more to look forward to when they do get older. My own experiences in the library that I do see that there is a lot more people in the library and there is a lot more you can do instead of reading books most of the time. You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when no one is home or to hang out with, and it does get boring just reading books so try something different for a little while then go back reading the book that you did start with and wanted to take a break from.      Then other people have their own voice to say something if they don't want it in their library. Some of my observations that I have seen were not really good. I've seen some protesters in front of the libraries and I have seen them close down because of it. But people sometime can take it to far and do sometimes burn it to the ground. I have seen people cry over it and it makes me really upset that I want to do something to help them but I really can't do nothing.      The most valueable thing is the kids and young children that read the books. What if someone burn down you home, this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them? They have the biggest voice of everybody put together. That if you do something that make them feel better that would be really good to them. That they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through. It is very difficult to have somewhere to go to read but there is nowhere to go.      If you don't want to be quiet then let your voice be heard aroud the world and have the freedom to let it come out. You have three diffenent voices your own, other people that do or don't agree and you have your children. So which one are you going to listen to? When you have a choice and you have to make it and hope you make the right one",0
"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration.",0
"I believe that people spend too much time on the computers. If people spend hours on the computer it will result in bad eye sight. They dont get enough exercise.most teens aren't getting home work done because of this CAPS1 people sit on the computer for countless hours their eye sight is slowly going bad. The bright lights of the screen make your eyes unclear state say more people lose eyesight from looking of a computer than they would by staring at a light. Sitting down in front of the screen you aren't down in front of the screen you arents getting any exercise. You mostly just move your hands and fingers. If people dont exercise for at least NUM1 minutes a day, we will all become week. Lastly, your teenager probably do their homework. while they are in his or her room they've most likely all the computers. if they spend too much time on the computer they are more likely to fail their classes. which means they will most likely stay back. In other words, people spend too much time on the computer. If we continue this most people will lose eye sight. if citizens keep sitting there then we will became unhealthy. And lastly, more teens want do homework and wont succeed.",0
"Just One CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 A CAPS4 CAPS5 the DATE1 of us, PERSON2, LOCATION1 and I, walk under the cover of the trees, we decided to stop by the lake, in our usual meeting place where we have a perfect view, to have a chat. LOCATION1, who is six foot DATE1, has long raven-black hair that just barely tickles his chin, deep blue eyes, and is extremely attractive, plopped down in the wet green grass. But PERSON2, who is six foot, has short brown hair, dark ocher colored eyes, chose to stand about DATE1 paces in front of us.  To any person strolling by, he would have looked CAPS5 if he was just enjoying the amazing view of the crystal water, but to us, who knew him all too well, knew he was thinking about his brother, PERSON1, who was in the hospital. PERSON1 had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, got in the middle of a homeless persons fight, not to mention the guy was drunk, and got stabbed with a rusty switch-blade. PERSON2 felt like it was his fault that this had happened, and this made him so depressed that he would not CAPS1 at any of our idiocy, or even eat for that matter. PERSON2's feeling that way made LOCATION1 and I feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up. PERSON2 was usually the most exuberant out of all of us, and we did every single thing we could possibly so to make him feel better, or, at the very least, get him to CAPS1 again. But not once could we budge him, or even get one little giggle out of his tightened jaw. Not one of our pathetic attempts even touched his eyes, but we never gave up, in fact, we tried for days on end to get him to smile again. We got to the point of desperation that we even dressed ourselves up CAPS5 teletubies, went to PERSON2's house, dragged him off of his couch, and took him downtown. Yet not one second of it did his mouth even twitch upwards.  Although we did some of the most outrageous, unimaginably embarrassing things we could possibly think of, and trust me, we though about it for days. We got absolutely no response what so ever out of him, except, of course, his enormous yawns.  Finally, about DATE1, we got him to giggle, which eventually turned into a full on, body shaking CAPS1. You will never guess what finally got him to crack. CAPS6-CAPS6 joke. Of all the horrendously obnoxious deeds we had done, cheesy, idiotic CAPS6-CAPS6 jokes are what got to him. Although LOCATION1 and I felt like complete idiots, we could not help but CAPS1 with him. After that day it was no longer a difficult process for him. PERSON2 was almost, but not quite, back to his normal self. So our lives went on, and PERSON1 got out of the hospital perfectly fine.",0

"I thnk the censorship in libraries CAPS1 quite abominomal. I think there should be no censorship, it CAPS1 for the parents to decide what children can an cannot watch. I think if something CAPS1 found offensive, then don't watch it, it's as simple as that. If you don't want your children to watch anything offensive or rude, then don't let them.     What I think offensive, CAPS1 when something CAPS1 removed off shelves. I think kids, though not yung kids, perhaps NUM1 and up, should be able to watch and listen to what they want. I think certain things that people find offensive, are only offensive to those kind of people. It MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, so don't take that particular movie, or song out of libraries.A good example of this would be the book, To CAPS2 A CAPS4. It has been banned and then unbanned from many school libraries, because of its vulgar words and references to rape. i think that CAPS1 unfair because , wether we like it or not, children NUM1 and over will most definatly hear rude and offensive things anyways.      I think books, or movies, or music, that have curse words, CAPS1 a part of life, because most adults curse. And taking those things away from a library CAPS1 taking it away from adults as well as kids. It CAPS1 for the parents to decide when their kids hear these things, if at any time. I also believe that using ' offensive' remarks, CAPS1 just another part of our history. Take To CAPS2 A CAPS4 for instance, back in that time, it was common for black people to talk slang, and common for men to curse when mad. That CAPS1 just how people are and were.      Taking those things off the shelves, will not protect adolescents from hearing them. I think they have rights to hear it if they want, and there parents have rights enough to let them. I think songs that have words bleeped out over the radio CAPS1 pointless because you teenager will know what they say anyway. I think having books banned CAPS1 a not wise thing to do, because it just makes kids want to hear the word more than usual.     Basically we have rights to hear and read those things. Taking away the things we have rights to, CAPS1 taking away our freedom and free will. If parents don't want to have their children read or hear those things, then they need to supervise what they read or listen to. It doesnt't make snese to single out a particular book, or song, that CAPS1 just like singling out all songs and books",0

"CAPS1 your life without computers. Writing articles on a typewriter or by hand would surely be a hassle. The question of whether or not computers are beneficial to society has risen in the media, where they argue that people spend less time exercising interacting with nature, and less time with their family. However, computers are a great step forward in modern science and are beneficial to communities. Computers have drastically helped out educationally at school, not to mention the easier way of connecting with friends and family. Also computers have so many different forms of entertainment. Computers are great step forward and are completely beneficial to our society. Firstly, computers have helped academically in our schools and at home. I can't even CAPS1 the hassle of coming home with thee assignment or writing two essays, only to have to write it by hand! Wanting to get it over with would only cause me to rush, resulting in a bad grade. Also, think of the handwriting factor. Most kids in my school don't have good handwriting, and I am assuming that teachers have a hard time grading something they can't read. With programs such as ORGANIZATION1 CAPS2, you are given the option of different fonts, colors, bolding, pictures, symbols, and so on. Another way computers have helped academically is in schools. More and more teachers are using computers to help us learn. Tests are taken on computers, websites to help us research are visited, and other ORGANIZATION1 program such as powerpoint can be used for a project. Computers help a lot in school, while helping us learn so much more. Computers also help with keeping in touch with friends and family. The days of short letters are replaced with long emails with pictures attached, sent in a matter of seconds whizzing through the internet only to arrive on your friend's screen. People can save money by not having pictures developed but instead having them stored on their computer, ready to print onto boand paper. There adveances in communication through computers that have been made. Things such as cideo chat (vchat) where you can literally see and talk to the other person, or just audio chat where you can talk to the person, have been made. Such easy ways of communication motivate people to speak to family and friends and stay in touch. Computers have made a positive impact on community by havinf simple ways to talk to your loved ones. Computers can alos provide a fun source of entertainment on the web. Websites have been created where you can play games, find people from your past, or maybe just look out funny videos. Anything you type into your toolbar instantly transforms into a page of links websites where you con find details on your topic, or relative things one fun website is that of 'youtube'. This website lets people upload videos. The possibility are endless on the web. Another fun website is 'CAPS3'. This website is where you can 'friend' people you know from the past and interact with them. You can post viedos, write messages and such. As you can see, entertainment is everywhere on the web. The time is now to understand the full benefits of computers. Computers are a benefit to modern day society because they help academically, encourage you to stay in touch with family and friend, and provide entertainment. We should all understand that computers are a huge advance in science, and they are a great help, and also fun!",0
"ORGANIZATION1, The computer to me is very beneficial. I say that because if wasn't CAPS4 the computers we wouldn't have as much knowledge about other contries like we do now. Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. CAPS4 example you heard about the CAPS1 that happen in LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website CAPS2, CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on himher. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great CAPS4 society.",0
"CAPS2 would you want to do in your spare time? Would you go outside and maybe CAPS3 the soccer ball around with your kids, or grab a bag of chips and log onto facebook or your email? The question is, do computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I believe that computers have a negative effect. Talking to friends on the computer doesn't let you learn social skills. Going on the computer can also be very addicting. Finally, it take's away from all the exercise you need. I CAPS4 that after careful consideration you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people. Facebook, ichat and email are all fun and easy ways to talk to your friends and family online. However, are you really gaining any social skills by doing this? Talking to friends and family online doesn't help you have good social skills. When you first meet someone in person, you most likely want to CAPS4 CAPS2 to say and how to act. Typing on a keyboard doesn't really let you interact with people. CAPS6 not invite someone over, or go out to lunch with your family istead? Computers also are very addicting. I can say for myself that once I log onto the computer, I might not be off for the next hours. This is the case for many other people too. Going on the computer is addicting. Il CAPS4 that not everyone is using a computer on a daily basis the vast majority of people are. When I'm on facebook and I see the number of people online is one hundred or even two hundred, as time goes by, the number increases. The computer being addicting leads to getting enough exercise. Doctors say that adults and kids should get atleast an hour of exercise a day. Going on the computer takes away from this time. Instead of sitting on the computer for an hour, you could be getting your hour of exercise. instead A lot of times when someone CAPS5 down at the computer, a snack goes with them. This just adds onto the fact CAPS6 getting the exercise is important to stay healthy. I CAPS4 that I would feel a lot better if I went for a run instead of going on the computer. You are probably saying that you have time to manage both, but some people would rather exercise. When these people see you on the computer, CAPS2 kind of example does it set? If everyone limited their time on the computer we would all feel a lot better and be more social. I trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people.",0
My opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. Computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things. People can do their work in the computer. To teach your childrens how to use a computer or let their children go on the internet to they can search kids stuff. People shouldn't all their time on the computers and spend less time with their families and friends. I think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. Probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer. They their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history. Do you think that people should alot more time with their families and be happy about it the they are spending time with their families. I think people shouldn't use the computer when they have a vistor over their house they don't their vistor think you are attracted to the computer. They should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and to learn things about the internet. But not everyone agree that people shouldn't use computers because people can get attracted to it and people don't want that. To happen. And families are concerned about that a lot of people use this can of stuff. Other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families. So do you think that people should spend more time on their families and friends then picking atention to the computers.,0
"Yes, I do believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  should be removed from the shelves if thery are found offensive. The reason why I think some things shuld be removed is because some kids don't need to look at certain things. Parents don't always go with there children to the library and tell them what they can and can't get. At school libraries they really dont have bad things they only have school approte things. But the public library has alot of different things and than a school library. Therefore those are my reaons why i believe certain materials should be removed.",0
"CAPS2 to PERSON2, ""Computers have helped me further CAPS6 research. I can search up so many things to help a patient and keep all CAPS6 important information organized."" CAPS3 you question a leading doctor? I agree with PERSON3 and say that computers are good use in society today. People were already becoming lazy because of television. You can't balme it on computers. With websites such as CAPS4 and CAPS5, people can keep in touch. They can make plans with one another to go for a walk in the park or dancing. These things can keep people healthy, active and in tiptop shape. Computers help people keep in contact with others. ""CAPS6 patients can email me to schedule an appointment and let me now if they think something's very wrong with them."" say's PERSON1. With computers, you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker. Most people tend not to pick up the phone if someone calls during a crisis. You also don't have to worry about running up your phone bill. you can just CAPS4 chat with a bud instead of using up an hours worth of minutes. You can learn so much more information faster. How CAPS3 feel if no one called and told you your bestfriend died or your mom, and you had to find out by reading the newspaper? You'd be extremely upset. I know I CAPS3 be with email, you and your family can stay in touch with old, new, and now friends. So if anything bad happens and a person didn't know hoe to tell you, they could email you. It's so much easier than telling a person that their.mom died by email them by phone. To hear pain in a person's voice will make you want to cry. You feel their pain. So, now do you understand that computers are a great benefit to today's society? You can't blame computer's for people becoming lazy, since television was already doing that. If a person want's to be lazy, then that's their decision. you shouln't go around blaming pothers and things when its no one else's fault but that persons. This is a great way to keep in contact with other's. Plus, think of all the information you can learn. Not just about family and friends, but the world too. Thank you for taking the time to read CAPS6 essay and I hope you can see things CAPS6 way.",0

The builders faced many obstacles while building a mast for dirigibles on the Empire State building. One was that the had to strengthen the foundation so that all the stress on the buildings structure wouldn't tear it apart. Also the fact it was impractical for a dirigible mast because shifting currents and winds would either make it impossible to land or would circle the blimp around and hit buildings. The workers faced these obstacles and finally realized that they couldn't do it.,0
"I strongly believe that technologies for kids and adults to use computers. I strongly believe that people have a bad affection people because you addicted, you spend less time with your family and friends. Finally, you spend less time excercising and doing great opportunities for your self. Clearly, i think that lettng students and adults use computers will take over their mind and make them addicted to the computer. This very bad because when your addicted to something, you can go back. This means you will have time for anything. For example, they micht forget what life is about and what was around for us to live in. Addiction is hard to get over , so don;t live your life in a box and play on nonsens live your life to the fullest. Over all, addiction in everything, including computers and a horrible . Without a doubt, spending too much time on computers will rott your brain and make you lazy. Meaning that the less you excersise, the less active you are. This problem is specially for teens. Teens have computer every week. cell phones, ipods, and many more. Alot of teens get cranky and the become node and neisty to their parents because they are testing to. As people dont excercise and move around alot, cause severe consequences like obesity and cancer. Obesity usually happens when you eating food, but it can also ahppen by not eating and not exercising. People that arent moving become lazy and have no desire to do anything which will an effect . Overall computers cause people to do the excercise and less active which will cause . Lastly, Computers make people spend less and less time with their family, and treat their computer as if the computers are . In everyday life , teens on their cell phones , their computers listening to , music . these electronics are causing. If this goes on alot of teens will loose the people they.

"""Laughter"" A good relationship is built on trust, right? That's what I've heard my whole life, but as I've grow and really started thinking for myself I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure trust is important but CAPS2 isn't the only key factor, I've learned laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but keeping CAPS2 full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding with each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, I am very fortunate. Sure we have hard times just like any family, but we are able tolaugh CAPS2 off with time and start new. CAPS5 helped me realize, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  CAPS1 a great bond with my mom is so important to me, we have not always ran so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay quite.Then seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried CAPS5 would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her. Whenever CAPS5 would joke around with me I would take CAPS2 all to seriously and whenever we would fight about small things I thought CAPS5 would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner my mom had informed me that CAPS2 was my night to do dishes, unlike usual I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came in my room upset and frustrated. CAPS5 said, ""PERSON1, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now."" I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen. CAPS5 followed me into the small bright room, ""PERSON1? Are you alright, CAPS2's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad."" CAPS5 exclaimed. Again not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes CAPS5 pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face, CAPS5 looked worried. CAPS5 explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that CAPS5 so desperately wanted to have with me. CAPS5 told me about how they would CAPS3 together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then CAPS3. ""CAPS3? What? Why would you guys do that?"" I questioned.  CAPS5 replied, "" CAPS4 laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say."" CAPS5 helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the fist time in my life I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chucked ourselves to sleep I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one other and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can CAPS3 off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything. I've truly realized the meaning of the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""",0
"I feel very strong about my opinion of what effects computers have on people as in it helps others communicate with one another, give people info about different types of things, and make people smarter. To me that sounds like something with a positive effect, would you say? First of all, as some people say it doesnt let you interact with family members. Yes it truely does you can interact with both friends, and family members by going to chat rooms such as aim, meebo.web cam meeting such as skype.com. So that throw that concern out or the window you work have to worry about that. Secondly, you get to learn info about differnt types of things such as learning about wild animals any animal like a giraffe, cat, rat or learn about different places like LOCATION2, LOCATION3, and LOCATION1 etc... Also you could find all of this info at home in one day. Most important I would make people smarter the computer teaches you hand eye corrdinations for free. The computer can teach you about any career, or regular job that you would need to learn about in just minutes, if needed? To conclude computers have positive effect on people, it lets people communicate with friends and family, you get to learn about different types of things, and it makes people smarter. Even I was done reading this it I thanked the lord for computer, it helps us so much.",0

Also it helps people meet or make CAPS1 friends. A computer is another way for people to get thier hand-eye cordination better. Computers are very helpfull in a humans life. Computers are usefull when trying to explore CAPS1 places. One can book a flight anywhere in a matter of minits on a computer. How else would it be possible to travel somplace far away without booking a flight on a computer. Next, computers help learn about different coltures. Once one has booked reservations to a certain travel spot on thier computer, they will learn much about the unfamiliar land they have went to. My family has gone to many different areas around the world. The trips would not have been possible without help researching and making flights with the computers. The computer makes it possible to experience to territorys. It is a key item when someone is looking to travel. A computer is emensly important when trying to communicate with friends. People can meet and make friends very simply using websites such as facebook on the computer. Facebook creats friendship very easily. I recently waited to get to know a students better. I looked him up on facebook and now we are aqetances. Next, programs on the computers such as A.I.M. help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics. Lastly, if one wants to get to know another better he or she can look at thier blog. They MONTH1 start to talk and become good friends. Computers are usfull when trying to comunicate or find friends. Computers not only help with travel and friends but it also helps with ones hand eye cordination. Typing letters while looking at a screen is using the hand eye coordination. This action can help with sports. For example in baseball one must have a good hand eye cordination to help catch and hit the ball. Secondly, with hand eye cordination getting better with the computer. it helps kids fit in. If one has good hand eye cordination they can play sports are make friends. If one becomes good with hand eye cordination and typeing they will be able to get a job writing for a newspaper or a book.

You could be improving your coordination and not even know it! Intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you. There are many computer games are there that you have to react quickly to and call for fast reflex and hand eye coordination. I know personally that it has help us. Since CAPS2 been on the computer more I have noticed that my reaction time off this block for has shockly improved! Yes, I know that some people should get outside and exercise, but you can excersize and improve your hand eye coordination, either way you can go wrong. As the massive sits in space like high take fascinating worlds it the computers. The technology of computers to learn about the far away places. Kevin, scientist that PERCENT2 of our knowing about space come from computers! For example think about google earth; it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world! I think you would agree that without computers we would a lot of knowledge about the wonderful world around us. Would you rather us not have computers and not know half the stuff about we live in? By these high tech computers we can learn about life outside like space, and other galaxies. Did you know that NUM1 of the population use the computer to talk, and reconnect to friends and family. I know I do! I know that people shouldn't be to computer, talking to people. But its a great way to stay in touch with people. They have awesome websites like skype and oovo that allows you to chat with other people over. Friendly, educated people agree that this is a good way to catch up with old friends from highschool or even way back to grade school. Another great aspect of online communicating is long friendships can be created. Newly explain, now they not online and got so close they ! Personally I know that I go to DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Internet websites like facebook helped me keep in touch with her. Clearly this is a great source to use!

"The architect of the new building had three large problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top. The first problem was the harsh wind that high up made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigible, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the Dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the levers"". Second The back of the dirigible would not be tied down. This problem would lead to safety hazards with people getting off of it, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This effect would also make a challenging and dangerous to take off. The last reason would be that it is illegal to fly aircraft sso low over the city already eliminating the possibility of allowing dirigibles to moor on top. Overall, this idea was not thought out well and was hurried so it would be the first building in the world to have a dirigible mooring mast",0
"CAPS1 I fell on my butt, again. I was trying to throw a front-full for cheer. A front-full is a big twisty thing in the air. I almost had it, I just couldnt land it.

PERSON1 can do many amazing things, he has competed many times. He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesnt. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. CAPS1 I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic try again, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didnt stick it.

The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there ware extrem to over come.one obstacles for the builders was trying to make it so the building its self could handle the stress of the dirigibles tied to the to the building with wind pulling at it and swaying back and forth as wind direction changes.Also it is to low for a dirigibles to be flying because of the other buildings. The most important is the gases inside the dirigible is flamible and would be devistation to the people below in New York City.,0
"In, The Mooring Mast, by ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.",0

"Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the ORGANIZATION1, it ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information?     Another topic in the ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.     As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.     In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case",0
"Do you find books you read offensive?  How about music, or magazines?  I sure don't.  I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read.  If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amout of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public.       I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book.  A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time.  They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time.  Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down.  I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book.     Music on the other hand could be thought of as different.  Many people could take music in the wrong way.  A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap.  Rappers tend to express themselves throughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language.  I personally don't get botherd by the music, because they are usually refering to their own life and how things went with them.  Music can also be on the good side too.  When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax.  Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to.     Then you have magazines.  Personally I think they are the worst of all.  Magazines tend to go one way or the other.  They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them.  One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story.  In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about.  Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it.       In these regaurds, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library.  There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side.  Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it.  With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music.  Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy.  There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way.  I don't believe there is anything worng with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement.",0
"Have you ever wanted to see the whole world with just a click of a button. That is as simple as just going out and purchasing a computer. Computers are becoming more and more popular. Some people think that people use computers too much. I am here to say that, that is a terrible accusation. First, computers help you with school work. Let's say you have an essay and it needs to be NUM1 words or more you can just use word cant, then you have the exact amount of words. Also you might need to look up some information about a certain topic. You can just simply type in the word and search and then you have millions of choices to choose from. If you had a homework assignment that you didn't understand you could look up how to do it on the internet. But this i just the begining. Another reason computers are so great is that you can meet and interact with people all over the world and learn their culture. You can enter a free chatroom and meet someone from LOCATION1. You would also be learning about their culture. This could also be a way to learn another language. If the person spoke fluently in CAPS1 and CAPS2 than he or she could teach you. You might be able to see how an CAPS2 household runs. You could then make comparisons between the way you both live your life. Finally, you can understand the world around you. There are many websites where you can get a live sattelite feed on places on every corner of the globe. You could also do reasearch on the planet itself. You can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it. You might also learn about nature. You could understand more about plants and animals. You can also got a look into space. You can learn about planets, if there is life on planets or water or anything else these would be things you can reasearch. So to sum it all up, you can get school work done. You can interact with people all over the world. You can also learn about the world around you and that covers less than a fraction of everything you can do on the computers, but don't stay on all day. Make sure you go outside and have a great time too!",0

I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story.",0
"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam",0
"CAPS1 do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I think that computer help in many different ways. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, helps us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about CAPS1 you computer can help you phisicly? Many parents state that, ""CAPS2 spend to much time on the computer!"" but what they don't know is that the computer is teaching them hand-eye cordination. Parents argue that kids wagh more because they sit inside on the computer, but if they do sertain things to limit the CAPS2 like only goind on sertain games, limiting there time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be a way important part of a childs life if used properly. What is you method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch CAPS3. But what if you arn't at school, or have any books around? What if your CAPS3 isn't telling you what yo need to know? Well, with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to you local library to a book, CAPS1 would you learn? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at home jobs today require computers, and without the computers the job would not be getting done. This is why I think computers benifit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one are? Probably not this is why websites like CAPS5 and CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. Ther internet helps us keep intuch with relatives friends and ever helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me heep in tuch with old friends.",0

"My Laughter Story CAPS1 you know that laughing really adds time to your life? Well you do now. Laughter is a great thing to have, because without laughter our world would be dull and pointless. On a day to day basis you should laugh everyday. Laughing can really help you get through a tough time.Me, PERSON3, PERSON1, and PERSON4 were just hanging out up at ORGANIZATION4's house one day and PERSON4 was being really funny, all of us were laughing hysterically at what PERSON4 was saying, then suddenly PERSON2 calls us and wants to hangout and for us to come to LOCATION1, but she said only NUM1 of us can go. So we all debated on who was going to go. We came to a decision and PERSON4 was the one having to stay back, but PERSON1 gave him something to keep him occupied. So PERSON1, PERSON3, and I were mobbing the bus to LOCATION1 LOCATION1. There was a tweaker on the bus and he was making us laugh so hard, but he wasn't even trying. So we arrived at ORGANIZATION1. We were all hungry so we decided to get some ORGANIZATION2. When we got to ORGANIZATION2 we all just got a dollar burger which were rip offs so we all saved our pickles that were on the burger so when we left we could stick them on the windows. We CAPS1 and it made us laugh so hard we could barley run away. When we arrived at ORGANIZATION3's apartment we knocked on her door, no one answered, so we knocked again, no answer again. We were just about to call her when she walks out of a different apartment and we all just started laughing because we pounded on someone elses door. When we walked in there was a party going on so we were like nice. When we got there we all had a couple of beers. We were having such a good time we were all just laughing and have the greatest time. That next morning we woke up at NUM2 a.m because we had to ride the bus back to LOCATION2 early because it was DATE1 and the buses run only for a little bit. When we got on the bus the bus driver was making weird faces like he was constipated or something but he made me laugh really hard.When we arrived back in LOCATION2 we called up PERSON4 to see what he was doing, he was just hanging out in town so we just went and kicked it with him for the rest of the day and later we all went home. It was a good weekend.",0
"You must be insane! Computers are very important to society. My first reason is, computers can be used for research. Secondly, can be made. Lastly, you can talk and video chat. These are my three reasons why computers are important to society. If you want to know more send on. Firstly, computers can be used for research. For example, what if your boss wats to find the of products ? All you have to do is go to www.google.com, and look it up! Is is that easy. Also what if you need to do reasearch on ORGANIZATION1 for school? Instead of reading books about him, you can type in his name, and theres your information. In CAPS1 NUM1 out of NUM2 kidsadults use the computer for research. This is my first reason. Secondly, purchases can be made. What if you would like to buy a plane ticket to LOCATION1 to help? You can go on the computer and buy a ticket at your convenience. You can order order all types of that needed to LOCATION1. Or that a relativefriend can have a. How way simplier than going out and doing it yourself. This is my second reason. Lastly you can talk and video chat. You own a other people, and you all in diffreent country need a a video meeting. What if you have relatives that live far away that you miss alot? You can have a video family. this is my last reason. I hope you consider my reasons why computers are very important to society.",0

"Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive? Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently' pick up this book and read it. It could scar them mentally for life.      Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol andor sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents? 'CAPS1, look what I found.' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent. The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book.      However, some CAPS2 do not find books like that on library shelves offensive. It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life. CAPS2 are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children. It can and will mentally scar them for life.       The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for CAPS2 and have the offensive moviesbooksmagazines, ect in there. Kids can't enter unless they are NUM1 or older. That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer.      Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up. We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other CAPS2. The library staff should take action and make a separate room for CAPS2 CAPS3",0

"I hate weddings. I love when people get married, but I hate the ceremonies. Theyre so boring. Especially the CAPS18 long weddings that take like two hours of people  just standing there on the after doing  nothing  Im not the most patient person, so thats probably why I hate long wedding. Now that is one long story about patience. Do we have to go? I moaned to CAPS4 mother. CAPS1 its PERSON1s wedding and its important. CAPS2. I had to surrender as I put on CAPS4 new dress and got in the car. The wedding was all the wapin LOCATION1. It usually takes only an hour to get there, but not this time.

Finally, when the traffic jam cleared up, dramatic event just shot out. The road we had to go down was closed. So much for taking the short way. We had just entered the town next to LOCATION1.

"A while back my mom had decided to send me to DATE3 camp. When I heard this I was pretty upset, CAPS1 I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started I did all I could to let my mom not let me go. After a while of that I knew I wouldn't get my way, and before I knew it I was off to camp. When I got to the place that was taking us to camp, there wasn't a lot of people there.  When I got to the camp I was wrong, there was a lot of people that I didn't know. It was extremely scary, but it was to late to go home now. Walking to my cabin was nerve racking, CAPS1 I didn't know who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward, mainly CAPS1 we didn't know each other and secondly our counselor was so weird. Right after meeting each other our counselor made all of us play a game of CAPS2. Playing CAPS2 at first with strangers was strange, but after a while we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours and hours, until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls was not so scary since we had so muh fun playing CAPS2, but we still didn't really know each other.  When lunch was over the first thing we did was play CAPS2, the more we laughed and had fun the more and more we started to get to know each other. All DATE1 we played the silly little game of CAPS2, and just giggled and laughed. DATE2 came along the second DATE1 of camp and all of us had almost become friend by just laughing and playing CAPS2. We played it so much the first DATE1 that we just called it ""CAPS6 CAPS2"" instead of CAPS2. Like other things we got tired of CAPS2 and went our separate ways for free time. Everyone agreed that free time that DATE1 was so boring so we played CAPS2 again. Laughing and laughing till our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard, that I think was the DATE1 all of us really became friends.  We had become thick as thieves in just a couple of days, we did everything together. We talked,we swam, we played tennis, and most importantly we laughed together. Camp was not what I expected it to be, it was way better. All the girls in my cabin had become friends so fast that it was strange to other people,not realy but it was kind of weird to become best friends in just a couple of days. Camp was flying by for us and before we all knew it it was almost the DATE1. Things were so good, until one of us got sick. I was the one who ended up sick, it was horrible I stayed in bed all DATE1 missing everything that was going on. Even worse I had almost lost my voice, laying in bed without laughing with my friends and having fun was just torture. DATE4 the DATE1 of camp was fastly approaching, and all I could do was stay in bed. DATE4 was there, but it was a relief when I could talk again. The rest of the DATE1 DATE1 of camp I could be out of bed and enjoying camp.  When DATE1 time was ending and evening was arriving, we had our cabin party. Our party was so much fun, even though we had to stay inside our cabin. We ate all of our treats we saved from the concession stand, and all of the treats our counselor brought. It was almost TIME1 so we had to go to bed soon, CAPS1 we where leaving in the TIME2. There was one DATE1 thing we had to do, and it was one DATE1 game of CAPS2. We played for about in hour, CAPS1 another counselor had to come tell us to be quiet.  Looking back at my first year of camp, I always remember how all of us became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp, and we do still play CAPS2. That year at camp I think is one at my favorite memories, CAPS1 we all became friends by just playing CAPS2 and laughing together.",0
"The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. Even during a time of CAPS1.S.A racism, the freinds still found ways to make them all happy and all got a long. Another fond memory he re-calls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in cuba but moved to LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. This taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true deffinition of family.",0
"Fishing trip gone wrong CAPS1 me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of CAPS7 life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with CAPS7 dad and brother to go fishing. CAPS7 dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new CAPS2 CAPS3 fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light CAPS18 the ground. Well as I grew older so did CAPS7 fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned MONEY1 CAPS7 pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for CAPS7 fishing needs anymore. So CAPS18 the day of CAPS7 tenth birthday CAPS7 family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new CAPS2 CAPS3 fishing pole. So after CAPS7 birthday I had acquired one hundred and MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night CAPS7 dad came up to me and told me that CAPS7 cousins wedding was this DATE1 and that we might have time after to CAPS15 a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed CAPS7 tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the CAPS7 cousins wedding CAPS7 dad said ""CAPS6 go fishing."" CAPS7 dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked ""CAPS8 dad we need to stop at ORGANIZATION1 quickly"". It turned out that there was a ORGANIZATION1 CAPS18 the way. We pulled into the ORGANIZATION1 parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last CAPS2 CAPS3 fishing pole siting CAPS18 the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy MONEY1. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with CAPS7 new CAPS2 CAPS3 fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. CAPS7 dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out CAPS7 new pole and tackle box and started to setup CAPS7 pole for river fishing. I put CAPS18 one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into CAPS7 big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. ""I think the fish will love this."" I say aloud to CAPS7 dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss CAPS7 baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, CAPS7 dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting CAPS7 pole down rather softly I look upon CAPS7 dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well CAPS18 our walk down to river there was this CAPS13 CAPS14 outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to CAPS7 right and said to CAPS7 dad ""CAPS15 not lose CAPS7 fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish CAPS18."" CAPS7 dad reply's ""CAPS17, CAPS17 just go to the bathroom already."" CAPS18 CAPS7 walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big CAPS19 that had landed near CAPS7 fishing line. CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to CAPS7 line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom CAPS7 dad goes running and waving his arms at the CAPS19. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you MONTH1 ask? It was CAPS7 brand new fishing pole! It was at least NUM1 maybe NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as CAPS7 pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land CAPS18 shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile ""That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly."" I start laughing uncontrollably then CAPS7 dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done CAPS7 dad looked CAPS18 shore for something to pull CAPS7 pole in with but to CAPS7 surprise he found it CAPS18 shore down river.Will CAPS20",0

"CAPS1 well CAPS1 many others, i believe computers are not only good, but beneficial. Computers are advanced our world little by little every day. We all use them for communication, entertainment, and knowledge. Computers are like people with fun to do and things to learn. Computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide. Computers gradually advance communication more and more everyday. It used to be old letters by mail, then it became e-mails, twitter, and facebook. These websites upgrage communication today. Long distance friends can view photos, information, videos, and chat from far away. Some site like ORGANIZATION2 allow you to instant message your friends. Lastly, video chatting is a new improved way to see a live video of the other person. According to ORGANIZATION1 NUM1 more user signed up for web-cams since the beggining of DATE1. Communication is positively affected by computers. I know you MONTH1 have fun with sports or nature, but sometimes it is great to get great entertainment for yourself instantly. Computer games only cost about MONEY1 and are instant access. Also, surfing the web for news or funny videos is fun sometimes. Almost everyone who has a CAPS2 gets a blast surfing the internet. Do you ever wonder how to hear the song you like when it's not on the radio? Itunes stores, organize, and plays music in a virtual library for permanent access. What also happens is youtube allows you to watch music videos or hear songs for free. Now thats why computers are straight entertainment. Finally, computers provide you with so much knowledge and is great for education. Certain websites let you access tons of knowledge. Wikipedia and diccionary.com are great for learning.",0
"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso created a few moods that are very relatable, yet make you think. One mood is happiness. This reading feels happy from the beginning to hand because it shows how Narciso went through his life, and what he loves about his childhood paragraph NUM1 says ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sentences show he loved the environment he lived in, and what was in his home, which made him happy.Narciso also created a mysterious mood. This mood made you think about your home, and what the word 'family' really means. Narciso's family was a great, big, loving group of people-many of whom were not even related. Paragraph NUM2 says ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows thier consideration of family was large, and inspiring.The main mood in this memoir from Narciso is gratefulness. Narciso is grateful for many things, especially being able to live his life the way he did.

"Do I believe that certain materials , such as books, music, movies,magazines, and so on should be removed? Yes I think that they should all be removed, becuase it could hurt people's feelings, and could make them do plenty of things. Such as suicide, drama, and so on having any of these things at a library could hurt someone's feelings. I really dont think that I would like having racial comments about me in a book so why would anyone else? I think that by removing all these things could make some peoples lifes better.     From exsperince in the library last week, I seen this girl that ran to her mom crying becuase she was african american, and the book said something about thier race. And she was all worried that what happend back in the day with all the slavery would happen again. I would be so terified reading about people that would make fun of my life, call me names, and beat me, that kind of thing would just ruien my day. Now I think that library's would learn to take this certain stuff out of stock.     Now that I have gave you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience. I think that they should take my advice, and realize that having that kind of stuff is not good for kids,teenagers, or even adults that they should not be reading that stuff. All it does is bring some people down, make them cry, and also so stupid stuff. Now by making the choice to remove all this stuff would be smart, and make things better for everyone",0

"After finishing the ORGANIZATION1, architects want to start mooring dirigibles right away. However, due to three potential problems the architect had never realized before, they never could moor any dirigibles. One problem was the most CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable, ad after the Hindenburg CAPS2 up in ORGANIZATION2, architects feared a similar catastrophe could happen in CAPS3, but many more would die. Another problem was high winds. Because it was so windy at the top of the building, it was almost impossible to hold the dirigibles steady. Also, the dirigible would have swiveled while tied to the building because there was nothing holding down the front and back. the third issue was that there was a law against flying dirigibles at the height that was necessary to moor on the Empire State Building. That's why no dirigibles ever successfully moored on the Empire State Building.",0
"When i go to the library, most of the time, I'm doing research on a specific topic. The information I want, is the facts that really happened, or took place. This would not be possible if they censored all the material the offended somebody.     Leaving libraries uncensored gives us the full effect of what we're reading, or researching. It is important for readers and researches, to connect and take in all the information they read. That is what keeps us interested in what we are doing.     Authors write the things they write, for a reason. Taking there hard work off the shelves, because some little thing offends someone, is not fair to them. Besides, either way, someone is getting offended, because the auther is goin to get offended, for taking his hard work off the shelves.     As you MONTH1 tell, i am against censoring our libraries.

"Yes there are many things today that have censorship,but should keep them out of our libraries.I think not.They should not be taken items out of the libraries do to censorships.Maybe if they are such a big concern they could do something else with them besides taking them out.     I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies,games,CAPS1's,etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment.     If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be NUM1 or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be NUM1.     Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying NUM1 and older.     So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people",0
"The author used the paragraph telling about how saeng would test in the spring at the end of the story because,the words used and the way it is read can tell the reader that saeng is at peace and accepts the fact that she lives in the u.s. When Saeng says,and this hibiscus plant is budding,"" she is thinking about how the plant reminds her of her native country. Also when she says, ""Then I will take this test again she is promising herself that she will take the test when she feels at home in her new country. Saeng also is in a way telling herself that she should accept the fact that she has moved and that she can still be reminded of her native country with the new hibiscus plant and many other things.",0
"There are many people that think certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries. If you had to do a project on a subject that was offensive to certain people and there was no information on it wouldn't you be a little upset? If you found somethings that are offensive interesting you should be able to go to your local library and read a book about it, and if you like to listen to offensive kind of music then you should be able to just turn the radio on and listen to it and not have to worry about those kinds of things getting removed.       Some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work. If the subject of your project was offensive to a certain race or person you would want there to be books or any other kind of information on the shelf at your local library so you could work on it. If all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries then nobody could be getting there work done.     Some people find some offensive subjects interesting. For example, if someone found the PERSON1 interesting they MONTH1 want to just do some research to learn more about it. If the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects.     There are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive. If they got rid of all of that kind of music then there would probably not be a lot of music left to listen to, and a lot of people would be very mad. Also, if they got rid of all of those types of music then the writers of those songs would not be able to make any money and would be out of a job.      I think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop complaining. All of the people who do not take these things offensively will be glad that they are not removings books, magazines, music, etc. I hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else",0
"Computers do a whole lot now of days. You can play games, do homework, socialize but don't you think there are better things than that. Such as exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and most importantly interacting with family and friends. These are all the things that computers take away from people. Once you get onto a computer you never want to get off. If you look at it, it doesn't take much work and energy to use a computer. So if you eat and use the computer all day your not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight. Computers make people feel lazy sometimes therefore they spend less time exercising. That is not good for your health at all. Exercising gives you energy and is good for you. Have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is? When your on the computer chit-chatting with people and playing online friends do you think about what your missing. Everytime I use the computer I wish I could be outside playing and enjoying nature. Trees, flowers, plants, grass and lots of other things are what make up the earth, but some people don't apreciate those things. So next time your on the computer think about that. While your on the computer wasting time there is another homeless child wandering maybe looking for their family. Would you like to be that child who doesnt have a family or any type of friends? Lots of people think of their life without a family but it can happen anyday. So I believe instead of wasting time on the computer we should go and interact with family and friends. Even if its just having a conversation do it, maybe it can show them that you really care. In conclusion, I think that computers are a waste of time. I understand how people say it is used to comunicate with people but back then they didnt have computers and they communicated so we can to. Computes make you spend less time exercising, keeps you from enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family and friends. You won't go wrong if you listen to someone who uses a computer everyday.",0
"The builders of the ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area. This was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to think of a place that extremely large dirigibles could land while in a crowded place like New York City. Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's Frame, which is dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders ORGANIZATION1 many different obstacles.",0
"The Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. This building being so tall, and large wind shifts were a constent worry. Wind shifts, is when the direction of the wind shifts suddenly. One minute its LOCATION1, the next its LOCATION2. On may 6, 1937, when German dirigible Hindenburg, caught on fire, people thought, what would have happened if that was over the empire state building. over New York, with such a large population, it would have been hectic. Airships werent allowed to fly that low anyways.",0

Patience is when your understanding and tolerant. Also a person that experiences difficulties without complaining. A time when I was patient was when my baby sister was born. I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born and then I could become a big sister. My little sister was supposed to be born on DATE1 twenty second. That day my mom wasnt even breaking a sweat. I thought she would be ready to go and get her bags(which she packed the night before) and ready to have the baby. I most certainly was. One week and two days later my mom went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I was patient for those nine days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could come inside of the room. When I saw my baby sisters face I almost started to cry. I knew I was going to love her and she was going to be just as patient as I was.,0
"Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. As in paragraph NUM1 ""the greatest reason was safety."" The most important issue was the blimps used hydrogen which was highly flamibale. An accident would of been tragic because of the heavily populated downtown CAPS1. Also nature proposed a big obstacle as well ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" there is a loving and happy mood created by the author. The author shows the love of his culture, home, and family. It makes the reader think of their family and their culture, and what and who they grow up with. The mood of this story made me think of my Italian grandparents and the sacrificies they made to get a better life for their family.The mood of this story also shows dedication, respect, admiration for loved ones. The author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I know when I read this line I realized all that my parents have done for me. The mood also makes me think of what my mom does for her job. She helps homeless teens find places to stay and she is always welcoming. Narciso's parents often let family and friends stay at their home to get them back on their feet.The mood of this story is very positive. It helps the reader make connections because all of our relatives know better how long ago made sacrifices for their family. The loving and respectful mood created by the author makes me think of my family.",0
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to structeral and safty issues. According to paragraph NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollares' worth of modifications to the buildings framework. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pidestrians created a even bigger obstacle for the builders.Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium which created huge fire hazzards ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph NUM2). Even though the exsisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, the biggest obstacle of them all was nature itself. The dirigibles shells could be punctured by the winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents.",0

Some of the stuff they might have in the are books about different colored people, maybe there might also have some terrible things about that colored skin hairitage, CAPS1 that are to young to be looking at stuff that is in these books. A lot of the CAPS2 Libraries have these things speard around all over the store.     Some of these people that get these books might need to have a good heart about what the book is saying about the skin color. If they don't like what the book and what it has to say then don't get that book. Because you can't change the way the author wrote the story, music, movie, poster. But most the people that I know that are different colored are pretty hilarious and sometimes make jokes about it.      Maybe there might also be some pretty terrible things said in the book",0
"Reading it is a joy to some and a pain to others. Do I think objects in the library with offensive details should be cleaned up or taken off the shelves? There are some things that could be censored, and others that wouldn't be worth using if it was censored. However, yes I do believe that there are items in the library that could be censored. I am going to tell you why they should be censored, and what should be censored.     The types of items in the library that shouldn't be cleaned up.  A perfect example of those items are historical documentaries or historical books they have no other way to get the information needed across to the reader or viewer. There are other types of library items in the library that could be censored. Like there are some magazines and movies that show uncensored scenes or pages that are not need to make a view across if there even is a view to get across. I think a movie, book, or a magazine should only be uncensored if it is trying to get a point across. If there are uncensored items not getting a point across then they have no business being in the library.      As people can see library there are circumstances where a book, movie, or magazine uncensored is very useful in getting information. There are more circumstances where a library item does not need uncensored details because it is just offensive. If you ask me if I think censorship is important in libraries than I would have to say yes and no. I just gave you some reasons why I would say that. The next time you are in the library looking for a book ask your self one question is it to offensive to be important.",0

That is why the story concludes with that paragraph.",0
"In my opinion, they should not censor books. They should be read the way that the author intended for CAPS4 to be read. I understand censoring songs and movies, though, so that they MONTH1 be played on the radio and in the theaters.      The books that are contraversial right now have great messages, and should not be taken off the shelves because everyone should read them. They were written with this language because CAPS4's the way people talked back then. These books are classics and should not be changed, or removed from the shelves.     In the book 'To CAPS1 a CAPS2 CAPS3' by PERSON1, they use a lot of bad language, but this is how they talked back then and the author is trying to convey a great message to the readers. CAPS4 should not be changed     CAPS4 is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio. When an artist writes a song, they know that CAPS4 won't be able to be played on the radio if CAPS4 has bad or graphic language. I don't think they mind changing a few words of their song so CAPS4 can be played on the radio for all to hear.     The song 'CAPS5 You' by ORGANIZATION1, they replaced the CAPS6 word with 'CAPS5'. When he wrote this song, he knew that CAPS4 wouldn't be able to play on the radio, so he changed a word, and CAPS4 is still a good song.     Movies are about the same as songs, they can't show a movie in theaters if CAPS4 is too graphic. They MONTH1 take out certain scenes, or change a few words, but that doesn't change the movie. Those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once CAPS4 is sold in stores.     I undertand and respect everyones opinion on this matter, I am just voicing mine. If these authors, or artists, wanted their work to be different, they would've made CAPS4 so.",0
"While builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into many problems. Al CAPS1 idea sounded unrealistic but with enough motivation they were set on trying to make it happen. After so much renovation, work, and ideas they had finally realized all the potential problems.What's being built all the problems became apparent. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in New Jersey... ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". Also they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. They feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down. Another reason is it is against the law to fly airships to low over urban areas. The builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building.",0
"CAPS1! Ah, I love hearing my computer thunk on when I wake up. Such a lovely sound. Some people feel the need to disagree and say computers are bad for people. But, I feel the computer is a magnificent invention. All that CAPS2 will help improve hand-eye cordination, you can look up anything in the world, and you can even meet new people and keep in touch with faraway friends. The world is just a click away! What's this? You need to write a paper on how to play baseball and improve your pitching skills at the same time? No need to worry, you can just type that paper up on the computer! This is one of the many perks of owning a computer. CAPS2 a paper is so much faster than writing CAPS3 by hand. Studies show that CAPS2 a paper is PERCENT1 faster than writing CAPS3 out. Even PERSON1, and handwriting enthusiest, says ""CAPS2 is so much easier than having to write! I type all my books proper handwriting."" CAPS3's been said by officials that most hand-writen lovers are converting to CAPS2 for better hand-eye cordination. If CAPS3's used by the people that oppose CAPS3, CAPS3's gotta be great! Let's say your doing a project on panda bears, but you don't know anything about them. What do you do? Search CAPS3 up on CAPS4.com of course! CAPS4.com is a bounty of information, serving up marsels of links for any-and every-topic. I remember this one time I had a big report to write but I didn't know anything about the subject. So what solved my problem? CAPS4! CAPS3's been proven that PERCENT2 of information found on CAPS4 is true. You know what else on the computer can help you with information? Just about any domain name on the web. Just type what your looking for, add .com at the end and CAPS5! all the information you could need. Hm, what else can the computer help with? I know. Your friend that moved away, you can send her a message and get back in touch. Or, if you don't like your friend that moved away, you can meet new people. For example, LOCATION1 is a sight designed to match people up for romantic relations. So maybe you don't like computers. Oh well, all I can tell you is that your missing a lot.

The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot. The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty.The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite.

The heat made him sweat perfusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use.",0
"In the piece ""The Mooring MAst,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it describes what the mast on the Empire State Building was really for. There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to CAPS1 on the mast. One problem they faced was that the dirigible landed on the roof would add stress to the building's frame. The stress and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building. This means the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a big issue for the mast. Because the dirigibles used hydrogen, it could catch on fire and be destroyed over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. This made the back of the ship swivel around. Lastley, it was not successful is because of the law against airships flying too low. Before the constructors built all this extra to the building they should have thought of all the defects it could have.",0

"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood for the story. The mood for his story is bittersweet. It is happy, but slightly sad. One way is is shown when CAPS1 mentions his grand parents. Rodriguez writes ""Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grand parents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my 'real' grand parents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, unil 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" It CAPS2 that it is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had ""grandparents"", CAPS1 didn't meet his actual grandparents until later on in his life.Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents. CAPS1 writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" It CAPS2 that his parents sacrificed for him. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by admiring his parents.

"In present day, most people live on the computer. Whether if for work or pleasure, everyone uses a computer. In a recent study, researchers determined that an average person spends NUM1 years of his or her life on the comptuer. Thats a total of NUM1 years of life waste. Most kids spend all day on the computer on CAPS1, facebook, CAPS2, and youtube. They could be using that time to be around family and friends making memories. Kids dont realize how short life is, they should be hiking, camping, spending time with friends and family. I think years from now when kids grow into adults, they will be looking back and regretting not spending more time with there family, or not taking opportunities to explore the world we live in. Instead, they will be looking back and thinking about the halarious video on youtube that got over one million hits. Also, as you MONTH1 know child obesety is on the rise, they are more overweight kids then there are then and healthy. If a you look back to the times before computers, you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new pamedemic. Kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air. I bet that if computers were taken away for NUM3 year, then the changes in health would be drastic. Kids would be alot healtheir and have lost the weight I hope that everyone can see the harms of the computer by reading this, and they will get rid of this poisiness object.",0
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness. Rodriguez explains how appriciative he is of his parents and every thing they have done for him.

Overall he thanked his parents and said ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.",0
"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advance in technology believe that computers have a positive affect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time in their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. I agree with those experts because many people take the computer serious and always want to be on. Though the CAPS3 users think there is nothing, negative about using the computers but there is. Such as increase light bill payment, obesity and like the experts said, ""CAPS1 time interacting with family and friends."" CAPS2, CAPS3 users of the computer cause light bill because if the user are constantly on, then computer must cnstantly be on, when the computer in constantly on, it causes the light bill to increase. I can connect to that because I used to be a CAPS3 user of the computer and my guardian would yell at me because of it. Ever since I had brought down the habbit od being a CAPS3 user my guardian has stated the light bill gas decreased. Another reason why CAPS3 user of the computer must decrease thier habbit is because of obesity. Obesity is when a man or women is overwieght. My imaginary friend is a CAPS3 user in my imagination. He is light many others, he never exerciszes with his friends because he is constantly on the computer. Last but not least,CAPS3 begin to slack on interesting with friends and family. As I stated in paragraph two that I used to be a CAPS3 user. I myself wouldn't accept invitation to couldn't go to movies with friends and I wouldn't help around the house. These were the main three thing I wouldn't do. Then I learned to not abuse the computer, not waste my time on it. but I also learned to be responsible with it. That's what I think many CAPS3 should do to. In conclusion, being sa constantly user is not healthy because it many cause obesity. Also, a CAPS3 user increased light bill, and wont spend time interacting.",0

"CAPS2 has been an argument wheter computers do or do not have a positive effect on people. Some believe, that computers have negative effets on people for example spending too much time, not exercising, and not interacting with family and friends. However, I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, lets people know about faraway places, and allows people to talk online. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people. Did you know hand-eye coordination can be helpful at times? Well, it true because if you are in distress and the phone is broken and you don't have a cellphone then send an emergency e-mail to one of your friends informing them to call all and since you have hand-eye coordination you can type without having to look down. Also if your in college and have an important essay due tomorrow then hand-eye coordination can really help you write down notes without having to look back at the writing paper. Finally, with hand-eye coordination it can help you can join the army because if you spot a threat you can aim and shoot quickly without having to take out the gun after threat attacks. To conclude, computers teaches hand-eye coordination. Have you ever wanted to go to a forgein places? Well with computers you can do that you can just search the place and see what the place has. Fethermore, if you want to learn to speak a forgein language you can all you have to do is type in the language with a question and search its so easy a baby can do it.

"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Often times something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast not ever becoming successful.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was the amount of modifications that needed to be made to the building's framework, as stated in paragraph NUM1. The other obstacle they faced was the fact that most countries outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, this made it impossible for dirigibles to stop in a densely populated area such as downtown New York, as stated in paragraph NUM2. A last obstacle they faced was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building.",0
"A book is more than words or happenings; they're adventures and stories that travel from one person to another. I find it amazing how someone from one country could write a book, then someone from another country could read it. Inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books, music, and movies; I believe things like that help shape us into who we are today.      There are many problems with entertainment today in my oppinion. They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy; which MONTH1 not be fit for some people.  I don't think they should take them off the shelves, but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect. Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them. While some of it is not appropriate, other parts of it guide us. It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst, but are hoping for the best. We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment, and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake.       I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams. If we see that one person can do it, we think, why can't I? Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted? Entertainment pushes that concept, but adds everything in it to show the reality of it. Whether these things have offense or harsh contents to them, they still prepare and help us to battle through everyday life.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, but they overlooked the potential problems in there design. A very big problem they faced was safety. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it blew up in New York. Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law. These all made it much harder to put a mast on the Empire State Building.",0
"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were. The used of hydrogen rather than helium because hydrogen is highly flammable. The obstacles of it was nature itself. There's always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down but, using these at the Empire State Building can dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the dirigible blows the sharp spires of the building can puncture the dirigible's shell. These are the reasons and obstacles why its hard to attempt the dock of the dirigibles.",0
"I personally think that people should not spend so much time on the computer. One reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because people spend to much time on them and not enough time exercising. Another reason why is because people aren't enjoying nature. Finally, my last reason is because people are spending less time interacting with family ans friends. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is bacause they are spenfing more time on them then exercising. People will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer. People should be running or going to the gym instead of going on the computer. Even if you have your own equipment at your house to exercis on it's still better then going on the computer and not getting any exercise at all. If people spent as much time exercising then they spend on the computer, then the average weight of a human will go way down. Another reason people should't spend so much time on the computer is because people are spending less time enjoying nature. People should be outside getting fresh air instead of being inside on the computer all day. I personally would way rather be outside playing baseball and getting fit then being inside on the computer getting fat. Even if you look at nature via comuter, it still wan't be the same because you actually aren't outside experiencing it yourself. If people waould spend as much time enjoying nature as they are on the computer. We would be living in a much more healthy and clean word. My last reason why I think people spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending less time interacting with family and friends. People could be in a dark room all day, isolated from everyone they came about just because they are on the computer. That to me just isn't right because they covered he spending quality time with their friends and family, instead they are spending time with their computer. If a person spends all their time on the computer then everyone they care about will gradually be slipping away even if they don't know it. So as you can see, it would be much better if people spend more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends then spending more time on the computer. even if you don't spend alot of your time on the computer yet, you will gradually spend more and more time on it everyday until eventually it's all you do.",0

These obstacles included the added, stress to the buildings frame, The excerpt states in paragraph nine ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" This obstacle would could cause the whole building structure to collapse which could cause death and alot of destruction. Another obstacle included nature. The excerpt states in paragraph fourteen ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These violent air current could cause the dirigibles to lose control and hit the building and other buildings around it. The stress being added to the Empire State building and nature itself were the two main obstacles for the builders.",0
"The mooring mast was a failure from the start.  The builders and architects were not looking at the problems that would be present but only at how to build the most.  The first main problem the building workers faced when attempting to allow these dirigible's to land was actually building a mast atop the highest building in the world.  Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the buildings framework to support the zepplins weight putting stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1, 250 ft above the ground.  Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety.  The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out.  For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty immenent people below would be harmed.  This project seems to present far too many obstables for these architects to overcome for docking a single blimp.",0

"'CAPS1 Books, Movies, Music, and Magazines?'          CAPS2 do people take CAPS1 books? Some people believe books, movies, music, and magazines should be sensored or 'band'. Why do people believe this should happen? Well there will be three topics that will be talked about in this eassy. The three topics are children, CAPS4, and religion.          First, 'CAPS3'. Many parents themselves don't want there child to be exposed to viloence, volgure language, or even possible drugs. Viloence is one of the main problems to do with all four of these types of entertainment. Influencing there child could cause a loss by doing things as far known as stupidty. Another is volgure language, to adults for a generation above us, they take it as being disrespectful. News wide to this very day deals with drugs and teens getting more into them, causing an overdose that could lead to death.          Second, 'CAPS4'. Many people going from black to whites to eveyone around the world with different colored skin or more different type of features as one another. Here starts racsism, meaning against ones color or there ethics. Now to this day it has been calmed down but there was a time that certain words labeled certian people showing that they were less than others. Leading this to riots and gang viloents to earning respect. They want to be treated as an equal not less than others that which our ancentors did them in the past.          Third, 'CAPS5'. Religion is pretty big in the world and shows alot about the past and what certain people believe in. Religion is shown in these four types of form in these objects. Everyone believes theres is the right way and someone elses is the wrong. They cause conflicts in between one an another. So trying to keep them from bein banned isn't going to help for religion matters, because people do talk and some people out there want to change certain people to believe what they think is right.          So back to CAPS2 would everyone or some take to CAPS1 books, movies, music, magazines? Well it's going to be exposed sooner or later. Options are let it happen now or let it happen later. The sooner could be better or for the worst. Either matters just let happen what happens, someone will learn from there experience so why banned now?",0
"CAPS3 was about a NUM1 hour drive to freedom hill and we had just left our house. Dad, mum, CAPS1 and I were going to see buddy guy and CAPS3 was going to be a NUM1 and a half hour concert.

We got out and drank pop and ate sand whiches because we had an hour or so before the concert started. After NUM3 minutes, or maybe NUM4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a spot to sit on the hill. Once we sat down, time stopped I waited and waited until I thought about NUM5 minutes had passed. I was expecting buddy to walk on stage any second, but CAPS2 never did. After what seemed NUM6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked âhow long has CAPS3 been since we sat down?â âabout five minutes.â CAPS2 replied. CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. âhow long?â âsix now.â CAPS3 wouldnât have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise. Minute after minute rolled by and someone stepped on stage. âThe performance will start in NUM7 minutes.â CAPS2 announced. CAPS3 was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over. Finally after NUM7 minutes of dying and waiting, CAPS2 walked on stage. CAPS3 was the best sight in the world. CAPS3 was worth the long, long wait and I enjoyed CAPS3 even more.

"The moods created by the author in the memoir is happiness, love, and gratitude To start, it made me feel happy because of  the way he described his house, and how delightful it was. ""cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote made me visualize the scene, and I felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting. Secondly, it made me feel loving to my loved ones like my family and friends.

"Patients is something not everybody has. In order for someone to be patient, you have to understand and tolerate things that might be very hard. I m one of those people.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, ""The architect could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"". A thousand-foot diriglble tethed by a single caple would add to much stress to the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. If not the Empire State Building might fall over. For the Empire State Building to take the extra load the architect would have to modify and strengthen the building's existing framework. Also the ornate mast would be difficult to raise on top of the Empire State build due to the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. If this happened the dirigible would crash into the Empire State Building or other building. This would be bad for the people on the street. Where dirigible's usually land are in open fields. The dirigible could be weighted down in the back with a lead weight. But on top of the Empire State Building dangling weights above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Also laws were passed restricting a dirigible from getting to close to a building.",0

"Censorship in media has been around since the beginning of ORGANIZATION1. Some of the first movies were seen as too offensive and never made it to the theatres, but books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries how do they even need to be censored?          Censorship of books should be if a book is not for children keep them away from it. Books that are extremely offensive should be taken off the shelf or not put in a library. A library is a place of learning or reading for entertainment and those very offensive books do not teach learning or are entertaining.          Music is another thing. Most songs out are highly offensive and should be in a different section. They should not be in the kid's area for music because do parents really want their children to learn cuss words at the age of five? Most parents do not want their children to learn cuss words and probably like if the libraries got rid of the music altogether that had to with sex, drugs, and cussing, all things that are censored in the media today. Maybe libraries can carry music that is censored instead of carrying music that is not censored.     Movies are almost the same as music because it potrays mostly what music has in it, but it is visual. Again parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear. Libraries should put the movies in the adult section of the library. They should be censored by putting a censor bar over the mouth of someone who is cussing or put the bar over the person's hand or wherever when they are making an inappropriate gesture.     Over the years it has become harder to censor magazines. Magazines are impossible to censor, unless you are the person receiving the magazine. If you are the libraries receiving the magazines grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive. The libraries should not carry the inappropriate magazines.     If you are at a library and you see something inappropriate tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question.",0
"Computers can be very useful to people. They can help contact friends and family from all over the world. You might need it for typing a paper for school or work, and you can use the internet.

When my friend went to LOCATION1 for the DATE1 I used instant messaging to talk to her. Imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay. Do you really want to write it all? Imagine you, writing out hundreds of those newspaper everyday. Typing is an easy solution that doesnt require as much work and it takes less time. Typing also makes work a lot neater and easier to read. Not even a library has all the information you need. What if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal? A library wont immediately buy new books about it. The internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens. What if a celebrity got hit by a bus or a rocket in space just landed sucesfully? You cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes. The internet gives information on anything possible. The internet also allowes students to take online schools or classes. When my oldest brother couldnt take CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college, he took an online CAPS1 class at home. The internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane, train, boat ticket? What if you need to rent a car but you cant go over to the store or airport. You can go online to purchase tickets. Have you ever heard someone say ""CAPS3 it upon google"" when they dont know the answer to something? I remember my friend telling me about her new dog, I never even heard of. When I got home I went on the internet and researched it. The internet is a very useful tool to everyone. Going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone, anywhere, type anything needed, or to use the internet. The computer makes life a little easier and its fun too, and would be a handy tool for writing a newspaper.",0

"Every one laughs, i love to laugh in fact that's one of my favorite things to do. If your in a bad mood or just cant get happy, laugh at things cause i am sure it will lighten up your mood and i will tell you what, its also very good for you in many ways. If people didn't laugh then this world world would be a very depressing, you smile at someone who isn't the happiest could totally change their mood. So as i have told you before i am a very happy and energetic person and laughing is what i do best,and i smile at everyone around me. well i have a story for you, i like to volunteer at homeless shelters and old folks home cause i believe i should share my happiness with everyone else around me it makes my soul feel good to help people out. This one after noon i was doing what i do best laughing and having a good time at the old folks home making people smile, they all love having me around cause they say i cheer them up. I run around room to room bringing in vases of flowers opening their curtains to let the beautiful sunshine in, i always told them vitamin CAPS1 is good to warm up the soul. There was this one man there who had never have a smile on his face and i did the same to him as i did to the other residents and no matter what i did he would never smile. When ever i came in he was always gazing out the window with a dead look on his face, so i had ask the nurses why he was so grumpy and quiet and they had told me he was a veteran. He didn't have much family from what i understood, or well at least they didn't visit him much they just dropped him off cause they didn't want to deal with the grumpiness any more. but i have a heart of gold and i feel like i should share. I had decided one day that i was going to turn that frown on his cute little face upside down, and make him feel happy and smile and interact with the other residents. So as usual i went in and did my daily routine to all the other rooms, we talked did some laughing and all sorts of stuff. I had saved the little old man for last i wasn't sure what his name was or what the what his whole background was like but i was going to go for it! I went in and he was staring out the window as usual, i hesitated for a minute cause i didn't know how he would react. So i went up and started talking to him, i introduced m self but he didn't seem to pleased. I asked him his name and he told me it was none of my business and that totally shot me down made me feel like i was the bad guy. So i started talking to him and asked him about his life, he had slowly opened up to and told me about all the stuff he had seen in the LOCATION1 war. He turned out to be a nice guy, all those nurses were wrong about him they didn't even try. We laughed for hours me and him, and it didn't get old. Ever since i talked to him he has been progressively started interacting with the others, they just didn't give him the time of day to explain his feelings or someone to talk to. So think about it next time your going to the store and you see someone who doesn't look like they're having the best day, and shot them a smile!!! :)",0
I think that the mood of this excerpt is caring. The parents wouldn't have (pretty much) given their lives away to start new and give their children a better place to live. They had a perfectly good life back at home but gave it all away for their children. That is why the mood of this excerpt is caring.,0
"because your worried about the computer. The weight that you put on you know just doesn't burn off by themselves. So by you not burning off that fat you just keep gaining and gaining. By the time you know it you'll be over weigh and wish you didn't spend all that time on that computer. How that I'm explaining about your of exercise. Where going to talk about your you bring on the computer all you would with your family. For example your family would want to go out but you say no because of that computer CAPS1 parents would CAPS1 they would because your lack of communication with the family. I've got my two reasons across let me get my third. Of you bing on that computer you have been adicted, but you just don't lose contact with family, but also with friends. You loving that computer so much you probably quite all your like the basketball, softball, and more teams because you thought it took to much of your computer time. In the end you would lose probably alot of frienships. CAPS1 your boyfriend or girlfriend would dump you. So now that you read this I hope I got my point out to you, about what a computer can do to you in the end.",0
The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it.

"The library is a place of learning, discovery, and knowledge, available to anyone willing to take the time to engross themselves in the rows and rows of information. Including children's books, novels for young adults, ORGANIZATION1, PERSON2, music, and movies, the library gives us a magnitude of opportunities to discover something we didn't know before. Although, there are other things that can be found in the library as well. Books including racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments can accidentally be stumbled upon while searching for something else. A parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this. I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries.      I would like to being by saying that I have an extreme issue with books that include comments, remarks, or names referring to people of a certain race. Imagine if an CAPS1 CAPS2 woman brought her daughter of NUM1 years into the library to find information about a school project. Instead of finding the birth date of PERSON1, she found a book making fun of CAPS1 CAPS4 and calling them inappropriate names. Children should not have to come across a discovery like that in a public facility, where fun and interesting facts should be found; not racial slurs. This type of event could cause serious damage on a child emotionally and mentally. That is why these types of things should be taken off the shelves immediately!     Another issue I have is with sexual content being found in libraries. I do understand that several books contain some sort of sexual content, but I am speaking of a novel describing a sex scene in extreme detail, or images of almost naked women on the cover. If someone is searching for a book of that kind, they can travel to a sex store somewhere nearby and get their fix of sexual reading pleasure. That type of book, however, should not be found in the library. It makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge.      Lastly, I would like to express how I feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries. Every human in the LOCATION1 is entitled to their own choice of religion. They MONTH1 practice it freely, which is sadly not the case for others in different countries. If we have an uncommom right such as freedom of religion, then why would we put books in our libraries that include rude comments towards different religions. A CAPS5 woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is an waste and stupid. This is not the truth, and it should not be in our libraries!      Even though I feel this way about inappropriate books, I understand there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship. Many people fear once we start removing certain books from libraries, more and more books will be taken from the public until almost all our libraries are empty. Yes, if we do not censor within certain limits, this could happen. This is not what I want to happen though. I simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain. The least we can do, as parents, is to take books, movies, magazines, and music containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments out of the libraries",0

"I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across the world. They teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned. Such as, hand-eye cordination. When you type up words it teaches you to see better with your eyes. Computers also, give people the ability to see, understand, and gives information about people across the world. Celebraties are very popular on computers or other technologies. Computers help you learn things better than any other technologies. Anything you can get on any other technologies. There is a guarantee of you will find it on your computer. Computers are just like other technologies but in some categories they're much better than the others. Computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other. If we did not have phones to use to call someone. On the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address. You can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years. You can look images or videos that you haven't seen in years. On computers, you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of. In conclusion all I say is that without computers in this world. What would it be like? Most technologies that are not as good computers will be popular without computers. I wonder what it will be like?",0
"Books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways. They all are some how offensive to people if they have inappropreiate launguage or actions or stories in them. Should thease materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are to offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting ahold of them?      When I go to the library I see different sections, fiction, nonfiction, ect. What I don't see is a section marked 'offensive'. Librarys don't do that. If parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the childrens area.      Librarys usually don't carry offensive music. They have CAPS1's for books to listen to. That might have offensive lauguage in it.  Before renting or buying the CAPS1 you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they conscider it offensive or not. If they don't know then don't get the CAPS1. Most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways.      If movies are offensice they are marked rated CAPS4. NUM1 movies are the better ones. If parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated CAPS4 movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you. When I was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated CAPS4 movies. She herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see.     Most of the time magazines don't have offensive lauguage in it but they sometimes have inappropreiate pictures of men and women. They also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read. But if your letting your children read this then you should read it before they do to make sure for yourself there is nothing you wouldn't want them reading.      I don't think there is any reason to remove books, music, movies, magazines, ect., from the shelves if they are offensive to some. If a parent or anyone else doesn't want their children or anyone else's children to read something they think is offensive they should make sure they read something before they let them read it. Also walk around with the child in the library to make sure they don't pick up anything they wouldn't like, or have their child pick things from the childrens section. Some people like reading books, magazines some might think are offensive. Everyone shouldn't be punished for those who just don't want their children finding offensive things in the library",0
"I believe that computers are a great invention. It lets people interact with people from very far off places. Has lots of fun games you can play. And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important. PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think ""well why doesn't the "" I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight But isn't the hour on the computer. Its eating habbits. Studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce. Just imagine this you straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project lige forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out looking all over the place and hyperventalating. But if you had a computer your daughter would be able to get the proect done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn't buy a computer she is going to fail her class not accepted to harvard and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I've gave you reasons to go out and but a computer you just lost to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives NUM1 miles away. Also it is a great way to play games.

"When I was NUM1 years old my mother and sister were working and cleaning around the house and I kept asking my CAPS3 can we go to get pizza? CAPS1 every time I asked she would reply, if you help us and we finish before dinner, we can go get pizza. I didnt want to wash windows, clean my room or wash the car. So I waited on the playground in the back yard swinging and going down the slide, CAPS1 after NUM2 minutes, it got boring. After that, thats when I knew I would have to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water. CAPS1 I was still bored. I got out of the river and ran to CAPS3. CAPS2 are you and PERSON1 done yet? I asked. Were done with the house CAPS1 the car has yet to be washed she answered. I walk to my bike and got my helmet which is sitting on my bike seat. The wind in my face was nothing compared to eating pizza, CAPS1 somehow driving up and down the drive way was more entertaining than cleaning. I hop of my bicycle and ran into the house, taking two immediate lefts after entering the house I look up at the clock, NUM3.m it said. My family always has dinner at NUM1:35 because my dad gets home from work at TIME1 and cooks dinner. I rush to see if my CAPS3 and sister were done yet, Are you done? I asked rudely. You could help if you want it to faster CAPS3 answers. CAPS4, fine Ill help, I grab the hose and spray the dirt and bird poop off the windows. After NUM5 minutes of cleaning we were done, CAPS3 left dad a note and she said, lets do! CAPS5 the whole day I waitd NUM6 hours for my CAPS3 and sister to finish CAPS1 in the end I finished the job.",0

I felt that she had hope because she is willing to take the test again. Since she is going to take the test again she wants to  help her mother. Second, the last paragraph gave me the feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She bought a flower to replace the dead ones, and she stated that she will re-take the test in the spring. Third, Saeng is helpful to her mother. Saeng finished digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, so her mom could go make dinner. Saeng also saw the feeling her mom felt when she found out Saeng did not pass the test. So she is re-taking the test. Saeng was feeling just about what any other new kid probably would have felt. She was scared, but through everything Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful.",0

By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant.

"Libraries contain many different selections of books, music, and magazines. However, are all of these materials appropriate for all CAPS1 visitors? In this essay I will explain to you why I think offensive, distracting and inappropraite material should be removed off of the shelves, and put into their own section of public CAPS2.     If a small child were to walk into a public CAPS1 and pick up a book about abortions, they would not know what the book is talking about, because most small children cannot read. What if a fifth grader was to pick that same book up? They would be able to read  the whole thing with no problems. However, should a fifth grader be allowed to pick up a book about abortions at such a young age? I dont think so, fifth graders should be reading age appropriate books. This is just one reason why I think offensive, distracting and inappropriate material should be moved to its own section of the CAPS1.     When I think of a CAPS1 I think of a quiet place that I can go to and read, or study. Although, some Libraries allow their visitors to listen to music. Rather it be on a computer, on a ipod, or even on a cell phone, there should be a sound limit right? Most people would think that Libraries set sound limits, and they probably do, but people do not follow directions and they are not attentive to what other people are doing. It is CAPS6 distracting to go into a CAPS1, to study, and the person next to you has their ipod blasted to a heavy metal rock song. Once again, this is another reason I think offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material should be moved to its own area of the CAPS1.     I also think that a CAPS1 is a community place, that you can go to and be safe, and your parents would not have to go with you because they think that it is safe and appropriate too. Most Libraries have magazines, because its for your entertainment, and they want to keep you happy so you will keep coming back. Well not all magazines are rated CAPS10, some have CAPS6 inappropriate material in them. A child should be looking at magazines that are appropriate for children, a teenager should be looking at magazines that are for teenagers, and an adult should be looking at magazines for adults. However the adult magazines should not be showing people with barely any clothes on, or any sexual scenes, and neither should teenage magazines. With innapropriate magazines, I do not think they should have their own section of the CAPS1, I think they should be removed all together. They have pictures in them and anyone can look at a picture.     I really hope you can understand my point of view. It is nothing against public Libraries, it is just the material inside of them. If I owned a public CAPS1, I would have rooms devoted to books that are for different age groups. For example, I would have a room for NUM1+, and a room for NUM2+. Those rooms would be for the books that are easily questionable for younger children. I would also have my own room devoted for music only. That way anyone could go in the room and listen to whatever kind of music they want, no questions asked. The rest of the CAPS1 would be for people to study, and read. I think every CAPS1 should be like this, it would help make the world a better place",0
"The builders faced many obstacles by building the Empire State Building.One obstacle was that Al Smith had competition with the Chrysler building. Which was forty-six feet taller, than the Empire State. Which led to Smith making the State Building reach the height of 1,250 feet. This leads to another obstacle, he wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. This didn't work due to lack of landing space. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would cause stress to the buildings frame.In conclusion I just explained the obstacles of the Empire State Building.",0
"In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines, and music that people find offensive. Some find them more offensive than others. I believe that just because someone finds these things offensive that they shouldn't be removed from the shelf. I believe this because other people MONTH1 be interested in it, we need information from the resources in the libraries, and all books make people more intelligent.     These resources are in the library for a reason.If what is on the shelves is a distraction to people, they don't have to pay any attention to it. People can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like. For example, there are books that talk about real things that happen to real people in real life and some MONTH1 not be able to handle the descriptive details that are given; if it's not easy to handle then just put it back and go read something else. Everyone in this world is different and we all like different things.     In addition, some books in the library are used for informational text. College students, teachers, and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines. For example, they MONTH1 need these rescources to help out with a class or presentation. If they were removed, they wouldn't have any way to find their information because it was found offensive.     Lastly, all books make people more intelligent. Sometimes things are abstruse and these books help explain them better.We learn something new everyday and we learn it from reading out of books. Not only books but magazines and movies help as well. Reading books help people to get stronger with their vocabulary and communication.For example, the people who read more than others are usually the ones who like to be involved in plays and don't have a problem with speaking in front of people. This is due to their intelligent reading levels. They are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary.      So as you can see, people like different things and some are going to find these rescources offensive. Also, books are used to help people out and they make people more intelligent. If books, movies, and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now. Every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is. Life comes with problems and we have to learn to deal with them. In fact, that is what we have to do when these problems come up because we all have a different outlook on everything but books being tooken off the shelves would not help anything; they can only help us out",0
"My best friend is probably my brother, PERSON2. It was in the middle of DATE1 and we were sitting outside on top of the wooden table in our mother's backyard. PERSON2 started telling me how much he wanted to be done with high school and that he was, ""just done with all this."" I sat there listening attentively for maybe thirty minutes as PERSON2 poured his heart out, and nearly broke mine with how distressed he was. PERSON2's best friend, PERSON1, had just told PERSON2 that CAPS1 he went out with the girl PERSON2 liked, then their friendship was over. PERSON2 was extremely hurt by this betrayal added on top of how he was afraid of getting kicked out of school because of his grades, and the amount of pressure coming from our parents at the time, was simply too much for seventeen year old PERSON2 to handle. I talked to PERSON2 for at least another half hour after that about what I thought he should do, at the end of our heart to heart talk I told PERSON2 that, ""CAPS1 you don't get it together and start geting good grades, their going to kick you out of school, PERSON2. Honestly, CAPS1 that happens I'm going to be really mad at you; becaus the only person CAPS2 and CAPS3 are going to have to nag on is me."" We both laughed quietly for a minute, paused, and laughed until we cried.  I don't know to this day what was so funny, maybe how serious everything was when we were just kids or CAPS1 it was simply a release of stress and anxiety for both of us. My tiny, little, lame joke that I dropped at the end of our talk just made it all seem okay, made us think about how young we are, how minor so many of these problems were in the grand scheme of life. That inital laughter made is possible for us to simply let go. After this happened PERSON2 and I went on with our lives as CAPS1 this had never happened, never speaking of it. Except that PERSON2 never got a bad grade in the rest of his high school career, he chose his friend over a chance at the girl but found another girl who has ORGANIZATION1's approval. Was it laughter that helped PERSON2 get through this difficult time? I couldn't say, but what I do know is that there was laughter there and PERSON2 did what he needed to do.",0

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said then I will take that test again. Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. For example when the author said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Those were reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.,0

"Havening a little bit of patience. Do you have patience or know some one who does well thats exacually what I am going to be talking about in my own way.

"Do you want your nine year old CAPS2 talking and reading about inappropreite subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my CAPS2. I think books that are offensive and inappropreite shouldn't be in LOCATION1 school or elementray schools with little ones or even NUM1 years olds. And parents should be in conrol of what thier kids watch and listen too.     Honstley we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them. Its the parents that are the only ones who can control thier children, no one else.     In libraries I feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropraite enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that NUM1 year olds shouldn't be reading.     Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have DATE1 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or CAPS4. And it should have parents permisson on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be aloud to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school.          All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason thier kids are immature and rude because they CAPS1 thier children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book, etc.     But what about CAPS4 theaters you ask? DONT CAPS1 YOUR CAPS2 CAPS3 TO THE CAPS4 CAPS5 CAPS6 YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school CAPS3 to the CAPS5 after school with friends and get in to see rated CAPS7 movies CAPS6 parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake CAPS8 so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will CAPS3 home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the CAPS4. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and disapline thier students. I've seen to many parents letting thier children get away with thier mouth and attitude. Most of my friends parents CAPS1 thier children get away with everything.      One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents and they eaither say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life. But I don't CAPS1 books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the edicational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends. Its the real world, the adult world.     So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things. Why kids are acting the way they are. Libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them. Please think about what I have said and thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this",0
"In today's society it is easy to find small things that offend people wether it is politics or religion. The truth is no one is able to keep everyone happy. A major debate of today would be that of the media. Should people have the right to remove books, music, movies, or magazines from our shelves because they are found offensive to one person? The answer is no. Three important reasons support this answer: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and knowing everyone can find something that is offensive.     When LOCATION1 was finally free from CAPS1 a main goal was to have our freedom of speech. This was a huge achievement for the ORGANIZATION1. Allowing people to remove matieral from our shelves would be breaking the one rule we worked so hard to gain. People today rely on being able to speak their minds to be apart of their government.     Another law that CAPS2's appriecate is, freedom of the press. Being allowed to write how they feel is what LOCATION1 is practically based on. With out this wouldn't we be back into the old ways that CAPS3 fought to change? This is a question you must think about when making this important decision.     Finally a huge impact on this decision is knowing that everyone has an opinion on something. It is easy to find someone that is offened by the smallest of things. What happens when someone decideds to find the CAPS4 offensive to their religion? Do we take it off the shelve and tell the CAPS5 sorry? If we decided to allow this would there even be books, movies, music, or even magazines for us?      It is easy to assume just to take a book off the shelve because it's offensive to you, but what happens when we allow this to everyone? That is why when coming to a decision on how we should handle this, it is going to take much more thinking than a couple of days. We must remember though the rights we are given as CAPS3; the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, and we must always think about how this is going to effect our later generations.",0
"During the DATE1 I decided to join ORGANIZATION2, I raised a market pig and was determined to sell it at the LOCATION1. Raising a pig was time consuming and hard work. Without patience, great teachers, and having fun I wouldn't have been able to do it. That DATE1 I had some great experiences and some of them, not so great. This was my first time being involved with ORGANIZATION2, also my first time raising a pig. I never thought that I would have so many awkward moments. One of my awkward, yet funny moments happened when I was shoveling pig poop with my friend ORGANIZATION1. This was also ORGANIZATION1's first time being involved with ORGANIZATION2 and raising a pig. ORGANIZATION1 and I were just trying to hurry and get our work finished so that we could go back to our homes and shower. Turns out I was in to much of a hurry. My boots sank into the mud and poop which made me lose my balance, I tried using the shovel to catch my self but it was too late. I was covered in pig poop and mud from head to toe, I had fallen in it. ORGANIZATION1 and I looked at each other for what seemed to be two minutes, but was only about six seconds, then we busted out in laughter. After our laughing was under control she helped me get up and we went to go find our agriculture teacher PERSON1.  When PERSON1 saw my once blue pants now brown, he couldn't help but laugh at me. He got his camera out and took some picture of me that are very embarrassing but make myself and others smile. After all the joking, laughing, and pictures were finished PERSON1 gave some old clothes to wear for my ride home. I had to roll the window down because the car got pretty smelly. When I arrived home, I headed straight for the shower. This is an experience I will never forget. If I didn't have friends around me I don't think I would have thought of the experience as something positive and funny. Because PERSON1 and ORGANIZATION1 were there to help me and laugh with me, I got some pretty fun memories out of that DATE1 raising a pig. Without the laughter it might of been a little negative, I might have been mad, or embarrassed, or sad. Laughter is an important element to have in a positive healthy lifestyle.",0
"The setting of this essay was the California desert in June. If any of the settings features affected the cyclist(which they all did) This had the biggest impact. In the fifth paragraph, the reader leaves that the author was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. My prior knowledge tells me that California is generally always a very hot place especially in the desert in June, the hottest month of the year This would have greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert  with a limited supply of water. This put him at a great risk for dehydration, which he tells the reader he reaches in the last time of paragraph ten. This terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the cyclist very tired and dehydrated, making his journey to CAPS1 ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult.",0
"Patience is, in definition, being understanding and tolerant. I am not patient, I understanding but I am not that tolerant. Some people though, are tolerant and understanding or patient. Here is a story of someone I know who is tolerant. In the NUM1 grade my math teachers assistant had to be so patient with our because they would ask the same questions over and over again. She would teach the lesson and than have to reteach it before to living questions. I was in the advanced group so we went fast and never really had to ask questions. I could never be as patient as she was teaching those people.",0
"In the excerpt ""THE MOORING MAST"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there were many obstacles that the workers had to face to allow Dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. One of the many obstacles the workers faced was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. Also the thousand-foot dirigibles moored at the top of the Empire State building. A single cable tether held the dirigible and it would add stress to the building's frame. The biggest obstacle the workers would face was the mooring mast on top of the building with all winds shifting due to vilent air currents. Another obstacle was the dirigibles were moored in open field and they were weighted down in the back. The problem was they were dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Those are the obstacles the workers faced",0
"Everyone knows how important a laugh can be. Everyone has a different laugh, it can be powerful and moving or devastating and hurtful. Someone said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I agree with this statement, everyone has a different laugh and and laughs for many different reasons, laughing is so powerful, someone can make you laugh when your upset or unhappy and they could change everything and how you are feeling. Laughing is a way of connecting with others, you laugh when you are having a good time, are hurt and need someone. Laughs are surprising you never know when your going to laugh and for what, it could be from a little joke or a funny elaborate story being told to you.  Over the DATE1 I was moving back to PERSON1 from LOCATION1, and I was very nervous and scared to be the new kid again. Even though I knew some people from when I used to live here, nothing was going to change the fact that I was the new kid. Not too long after I moved I got reconnected with some old friends of mine that I have known since the second grade when I lived here before. My friends and I are always having a good time, laughing, and just being crazy. All of us girls have been through a lot the past few years and that DATE1, and it was nice to see them and talk to them again after all that has happened to us, we have all gone of and done our own thing and became friends with different people, but we are still close friends after all this time. It was good to spend time with them and see how much they have changed. We have all changed a lot in the past few years. And we MONTH1 have fought caused some drama and some of us moved away, but we have been through almost everything together since we were little kids and probably will still be friends through out high school and collage.  DATE1 was almost over and school would be starting again me and three other friends of mine wanted to something all together one last time before school started. So we planed to have one big sleepover. one of the friends lives in LOCATION2, and she was able to come out to PERSON1 and have this sleepover with us. It was just like second grade again, I don't think I have ever laughed as hard in my life. Not long after we all got there, we were laughing, talking, and having a great time. That night we were all sleeping over, we were thinking of something fun to do, and of my friends decided it would be fun to go CAPS1'ing, so we asked her mom if it was CAPS2 and she said as long as we don't go to far way from home and we have our phones on us in case we need to call her and have her pick us up. It was still a little too early for CAPS1'ing, so until we waited for it to get dark, we walked to the store down the street from her house and bought bags and bags of toilet paper. It still wasn't dark or late enough to go, so we watched some movies, went to the mall, and stuck our feet in her hot tub. I was nice being back and being with all my old friends again. We stayed up and finally it was dark and late, so we put on all of the black clothes we owned and disguised our selves so no would could recognize us, we looked pretty convincing. We put on big jackets so we could hide the toilet paper in our jackets and if someone saw us walking they wouldn't see any of the toilet paper. We tried to be quit and sneak up on houses, but it dint work, we were so loud, we could not stop talking or laughing. We were being so loud we couldn't hear some other kids out late on their bikes also. They got closer and close and we realized it was some other guy friends we know from school, they got board and went for a bike ride. They helped us CAPS1 some houses and it was getting really late, so we decided to head back.  This DATE1 was one I will never forget, we had so much fun and we agreed we have never laughed so much for anything. It was a hard year for all of us and it was great to see some familiar faces and spend time with some true friends like we used to.",0
"The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in his memoirs is very proud of his parents and happy. ""... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not."" The author is happy, remembering memories, which are not unhappy or unpleasant. It's not romantic, lonely, or sad, it's happy, fun-filled, friendly, and fulfilled. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso is very appreciative of his parents, moving so CAPS1 could have a better life and education than them. CAPS1 expresses his gratitude toward them a lot. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" CAPS1 writes about how CAPS1 told them what they did was a more courageous thing than CAPS1 ever could have done, and his admiration for their perseverance and strength. CAPS1 really does love and appreciate his parents and everything they did for him, that being a main theme of the memoir.

"The mood creatd by the author in the memoir is a happy, loving, and thankful mood. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.

""Growing up in this environment it instilled in me a greate sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Here he is talking about the fact that he loves his family, even if he isn't a blood relative with them, that puts me in a loving mood.

What he was saying was he was grateful to his parents for what they did for him so that makes me feel thankful for my parents. That was the mood I felt created by the author in the memoir.",0
"In our world today, there is a way to find anything that you could ever want under one roof.  People call these buildings libraries.  Libraries hold almost every book ever writen and offer them to the public free of charge.  If you can not find what you are looking for in a book, they also have many other resources: movies, music, magazines, and the internet.  I am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody.     There is always somebody out in the world that would say they are offened just to make a point or to get attention in our world today even if they did not even care about the subject at hand.  The internet can take you to just about any thing that you would ever want to go to.  Yes, the libraries do have blocks on the internet for websites that are very outragously offensive, but people have learned how to get around the blocks.     Libraries are set up to where all the kids materials is in one location, all the teenage stuff is in another spot, and all the adult materials are in another room.  As a young child, I liked going to  libraries and having fun and reading, but the one thing I never did was go to the adult room and I think many other other kids feel the same way.  In fact, I have never seen a child in the adult section of a library.     Movies and music have ratings and if the rating is over what the child should be watching, then the child can not check the movie or music without a parent's signiture.  This ensures that kids can not check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent.     Our libraries are set up just fine the way they are and I feel we should not try to change the libraries in any way.  Movies and music have rating and kids can not check out offensive materials.  The materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest.  Last but not least, if we took out everything in libraries that are offensive, then we would know longer have libraries in our communities.",0

"The CAPS1 of Laughter   The CAPS1 of a single laugh is quite an astonishing thing. Laughter has a strange way to either bring two people together or when used wrongly tear those people apart. In all of my relationships I have realized that being able to joke around and laugh with one another is a big deal. I have come to notice lately that I have an amazing best friend. PERSON1 is always here for me even after the mistake I made that ended tearing us apart. Now that we have gotten over The CAPS2 and can laugh about it, I've realized it makes being embarrassed a lot easier and brings me and my friends together. Even when a best friend does something that wasn't right and neither one wants to fix it.   The CAPS2 began last DATE1 during my CAPS4 soccer season, and should have never gone as far as it did or involved one of my friends. It was the hardest thing to admit that I had done wrong; both to her and him. The day we had gotten caught is now what I consider the scariest and worst day of my life. The CAPS2 has also become a big learning point in my life, I've learned that all my actions do have consequences and how to balance what I want with what I should actually do.   When I first started soccer for CAPS4, I had never played with any of the people and I realized that by being the youngest on a NUM1 team I would have to stand out and prove myself. Which is exactly what I did; just not to the whole team. After playing for about two weeks I had started to notice one of the boys who was on my team. I hadn't really thought much about it but when both me and him started to pursue our relationship it became a whole other thing. The boy and I had been dating for about a month and a half when this began to involve PERSON1. See we weren't exactly allowed to hang out or even date for that matter, but we knew that we would take the chance of getting into trouble for each other. And as time went on and we had began to get closer to each other, we also had began falling in love. That MONTH1 have been the reason I had chosen what I had but at the time it all seemed to make perfect sense.    Then the ORGANIZATION1 came around and we thought it would be the perfect time to see each other, little did we know this choice would result in us losing each other, me losing my freedom, both of us ruining my parent's trust and the worst of all me throwing away a great friend. We didn't think of these consequences so we went through with it. He would meet me at the ORGANIZATION1 and I would tell my parents that I was just going to be with PERSON1. At the beginning and throughout most of the time everything was going well me and him were having an amazing time because we could finally hang out with one another and nobody knew what was really going on. Little did I know that my mother had called PERSON1's mom to make sure that I was going to be were I said and with who I said, and as soon as she found out I wasn't everything went down hill from there.    It had already been a couple hours and we were starting to get hungry but neither of us wanted to eat the greasy food at the ORGANIZATION1 so we decided to take yet another chance and leave, with me leaving PERSON1 at the ORGANIZATION1 and her not knowing were I went. As my mom became more and more worried she starting calling PERSON1 to see were I was and of course PERSON1 had no idea. On her list to call next was me. When my mom first tried calling me I decided not to answer and have her think i was just on a ride or something, but when she kept calling I knew that something was wrong. As I answered the phone I knew that she knew what I had been doing, but I still didn't want to believe what was happening. I thought that the only way my mom could have found out was because PERSON1 called and told her that she couldn't find me and who I was with.    So that is what I ended up accusing PERSON1 of for at least a month after it happened. I couldn't look at her or even talk to her with out feeling resentment and embarrassment. When everything finally settled down, from being caught to being grounded the whole DATE2, I knew that I needed to apologize for the position I put PERSON1 in. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. But now knowing that PERSON1 and I can laugh about it makes remembering that time so much easier and better.",0
"here are my reasons. You can get in contact with people, if you have a question you can look it up and you can do your job on a computer. I think that these reason will have you positive too. Many people like computers and have one. My first reason is you can get in toch with friends and family. I think this is a good reason because if your grandmother lives in LOCATION2 you dont want to drive there every time you want to see her when you live in LOCATION1. You would use the computer to live chat with her so you wouldent have to drive all the doun there. If you wanted to you could plan a day to go and see her. You would use a computer to get in touch with friends. If you needed to ask them a question about the homework they could answer it. That is my first reason why computers have a positive way on people. My second reason is if you have a computer you can look up questions that you would have. If you needed to know some thing for a big report and none of your friends are up you can look up your computer. Computers can help you so much if you need an answer. If you didet hav a computer if you would be so hard to do stuff. That is why I think that computer can answer your questions. My third reason is you can work on the computer. If your a stay at home mom ya can work on the computer to handle finances. A lot of people work on the computer to save the envirment. When I grow up Ill probaly work on the computer because it is easer. That is why I think that you can work on the computer. The reason I picked were you can get in tuch with family and friends, you can look up a question that you might have, and you can work on a computer. I hope you have a positive way on computers they help you out. People might think that they not your brain not they dont help and knoledge you. Many people like and have one. I think that you should have a positive way on computers too.",0

"All terms of offense are based on an opinion. If one person finds a particular word offensive, doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way. Some parents aren't as strict on there kids as others, and some just dont care.      Of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really dont need to belistening to. The horror movies that are rater ''CAPS1' for a reason, they could have nightmare for weeks. Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten. They still cant tell whats real and whats not. They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, to act, to do, even to think. Children just are't mature enough to handle a mojority of material in this world. No books should be taken away or hiddne fvrom society, it should just be given to you at your own disgression. Another possiblility would be have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particualr material. All information is helpful, just not all is necessary.     These days its hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. This wolrd is becoming less and less sensitive everyday. Eventually everyone will be completly insensitive to all 'harmful' movies, books ,amgazines, CAPS2 shows, and music. It wont even phase anyone anymore.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirig ibles to dock there. One problem was strengthening the building's frame. This was necessary because the added pressure of the dirigible's load and wind  needed to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation. The existing skeleton of the building had to be edited. In fact, these edits cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem builders faced was constructing the mast itself. To give it a unique look, architects made the tower out of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. They had to place the machinery at the base of this tower. The builders also had to make sure it was accessible to passengers; they made sure luggage and people could go to and from the aircraft. These are two of the challenges builders faced is constructing the Empire State Building. Despite the mast being unused in the present day, the design makes this building one of the most well-known buildings in the world.",0
"CAPS1 the world forty years ago. People would need to travel to visit a library to research, every document, doctors notes, and building plan would have to be written by hand or on an old typewriter. Life would have been much more difficult. Today, computers allow us to communicate with one another, access the millions of websites on the internet and help with school work. Almost everyday, my mon and dad receive friend requests from long lost school friends as well as relatives and current friends. Today's computers allow the world to talk to one another and know what is going on. My dad always says "" CAPS2 makes the world go round."" With the social networking sites, everyone is receiving tons of CAPS2 about one another. Another way to communicate is by video chat. All CAPS3 computers are equipped with a video camera and you can buy one if you have a CAPS4. This will let you see the person's face are talking to. I have heard many amazing stories about this. One is about a soldier in LOCATION1 and his present wife back home. The doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was, in a way, in two places at once. The man got to see his newborn baby and his wife. Computers can do amazing things! Another reason computers are great is their accessability to the internet. There is this cool website called CAPS5.Dcotors.Com. If you have an illness or a symtom to something, all you have to do is type it in on the home page and it will list all the possible reasons or outcomes. It also tells you how to treat it and where to find the medicine. If we looked back in time, one would need to travel to a doctor and pay to have your problem checked out. Also computers help out immensely with school work and homework. Many teachers nowadays request or demand students to type their asignments because it is easy to read, and it is easier to correct. I also find it faster to type then print. Say that you need to research the periodic table and write down NUM1 facts as well as all the elements. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject. All you need to do is type it in on google. You can also add an image by copy and pasting; which will inhance your work. Computers have helped students and teachers. Lastyly, computers (and tehn keyboards) are helping people with hand - eye coordination. Many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students. I recently searched this topic on the internet and it showed a study done by PERSON1 and PERSON2 that people who practice typing at least NUM2 minutes a day, will experience increased hand-eye coordination to PERCENT1 better. This increase would help many, people with low coordination. Today, computers are helping the world in many ways. From communication, to internet accessability, then to helping hand-eye coordination. The world would change for the worse if computers were abandoned.",0

"You know how people say that school is the most fun place to be during the day? Well i would have to be agree to that because when I'm at school I would laugh all day long when i see my friend name PERSON1. We would have fun all day long just the three of us in the same classes but two classes but we still be laughing in the halls and in the class rooms some times at each other and people that we don't know. I always loved coming to school last year but this year is not that much fun because PERSON1 moved into the CAPS1-es and I don't know where she lives now but after PERSON1 left the good old days was fun with her it sucks that we are not going to the same schools with her or her still coming to school with us now it is just the two of us LOCATION1 and my self we hardly have some fun in class without her but most of the days we do.   I remember when PERSON1 first came to this school she look like the other girls in our class but once we got to know her we became best friends. the next day she though that we would not like her because is a new kid at the school and that stuff we got to know her all to well because we would hang out with etcher teacher back from the seventh grade we would hang out. The thing that i always love about PERSON1 is that she would turn anyone whom is having a bad day and turn it into a really good day for you she would always do things like that but there are some days when she is felling down and blue and PERSON2 and me would try to make her feel but she would just get mad at us because we wasn't there for her when she needed us. I felt so bad after that but we are friends and friends so post to be there no matter what. The next day she wouldn't remember what was going on yesterday because she wouldn't remember that much when she is really mad at someone. one time in one of my classes we was not doing much in that class because there was not that much people in there we were painting and me and PERSON1 was painting bulletin board. the colors was white and brown we kinda of got it all over the place and each other i panted her hand haft brown and the other side white and she got some of it on the paper that we was using to let it dry up so we can paint again but that did not work out so good because we had to go yo our next class. The next day we was in that class we almost the same thing but we kinda of got it on the grand, sink, sops descender, and each other we draw a little something on each other i draw a heart that has her name in it her name was in pen and the heart was in paint. In our next class we was laughing the rest of the day we even got my sister LOCATION1 to laugh with us even through it was not that funny because we ate a lot of candy and candy makes us laughter all the time. these days are the days that I'll remember all the time because PERSON1, LOCATION1, and I are always laughing all that time because we always find something to laugh about and talk about. Out of all the times that i laugh the most fun ones are with my friend PERSON1 because we would have lots of fun when we are with her she is the glue that was holding us together. I think when all of us are together we are always laughing every scent of the day. No matter what we did or didn't do we would laugh all that time. This one we would say ""like"" all the time in one of our classes that we would have all that time during fifth because we was the only two girls in there with four boys and a guy teacher so PERSON1 and me would do almost anything in that class because we would not do anything that would get us in troble.",0

"DATE1 CAPS1 The CAPS2, I believe that computers in today's society have a possitve affect on people. I believe this because if people use it for education purposes to chat, email, or to reasearch it does make a difference in peoples lives. If you use the computer for educational purposes like games, you could really learn a lot. For example, I help my sister with her multiplication on a math game we have. Also, I learned to type with type to learn CAPS3. on my desktop computer at home. Many other people use it for these reasons too. They also might use it for typing a project or making a presentation. Others might only use it for chat and e-mail. These things can still benefit our society though. Using the computer for chat, such as, facebook, myspace, and twitter can also benefit our society today. These websites benefit us because we can meet new people, catch up with old friends, or even talk with carrent friends. also on ORGANIZATION2, ORGANIZATION1, or ORGANIZATION3 we can e-mail people instead of instant messaging them. For example, if you have something really big to say to someone you might want to write on email. If you just want to say hello you could use facebook, myspace, or twitter if you have an account. Computers do benefit our society today. All of the reasons in my letter support my position on wether or not computers benefit our society.",0
"I believe that censorship is a very debatable subject for many.But I think that I have a pretty good outlook , and a pretty good view on this. In this essay I'm going to give you my reasoning, and explain , and give some reasons why I think censorship is a good thing , and should maybe be inforced heavier.           Censorship. Should books, music, movies , magazines, etc. be taken off the shelf.. I believe that it is LOCATION1 , and everyone should have their right to read what they want to,  and what they don't . I believe , that if someone want's to read something vulgur , then let them. If they are an adult , it's their choice. I think as far as the child part of it , that no , children should not be aloud to read things that MONTH1 be vulgar, sexual , etc.           In keeping children away from these vulgar things , they should have,or keep seperate sections for kids, and adults. I dont think that children should be able to have the access, and maybe they won't know about it, or want it. If their parents think it's okay , and want to let them read it, or watch it, or listen to it,  that before they become an adult they will have to get it for them. I don't believe that children should be candy coated, and blind to the world, I just believe that there is a certain extent to what they need to be limited to.           I obviously think that censorship is a good thing. I think if there was more of it, I think there would be less crime. Kids are learning this , they're watching as young as god knows what, thinking it's okay from the start, and are growing up with that picture ,and message ,of them thinking it's okay  . No I am not saying that all kids learn everything from t.v., etc. ,and yes some MONTH1 argue that kids dont copy what's on t.v. at all . But I think that t.v. , books, and music affect alot of how children view the world.           As much as I love rap music , and movies such as A.T.L ,rappers such as ORGANIZATION1, even sometimes when I watch, or listen to those things, it kind of makes me feel like being jaded, and kind of makes me feel like I want to have a bad attitude towards the world, it makes me feel like I wanna live that hard life like that. I think that music , books, what we watch on t.v. , and what we read in the magazines , have a big affect. Such as if we watch the news and there's something depressing, it kind of makes you in a bad mood , or sad or depressed.           The media ,music , t.v., books , magazines, etc., affect our mood, our actions, and even sometimes the way we talk, and dress. I am not saying that dressing that more urban feel is a bad thing , I am just saying when you start doing crime, and drugs because of it, it's a problem. I believe that children should only be censored and not adults, because at the point when u reach adult-hood , your pretty much set in your way's, and have a pretty good look out on what you should be doing, and how you want thing's done. Children are still machuring ,and are like a sponge. Censorship , is a very sensitive , and argumentabledebatable issue, but this is just my view, whats yours ?",0
The mood created by the author in this memoir is greatfulness. The memoir showed how greatful Narciso's was to his parents. Their bravery and selflessness must have truley impacted his life then and probaly how he lives today. It also give the feeling of respect. In this memoir it shows how much he truley respected his parents and community. And last I think it gives the mood of admiration. The memoir really expressed how much he admired his parents and community. It showed how much he admired his parents bravery and he admired his overcoming of odds. He also admired how a community of different races could get over that and pull toghether to really make a community.Those are some of the moods that ar expressed in this memoir.,0
"In this excerpt from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a very clear mood in the memoir. Narciso Rodriguez's ""eternally grateful for his family and everything they did for him. For example, ""[Narciso Rodriguez] will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" CAPS1 admires ""their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" PERSON1 feels that ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" PERSON1 ""learned the real definition of 'family.'"" PERSON1 ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""",0
"Guess that she is saying that when winter is gone she will prepared for that winter test again. I guess this because they were not prepared for the winter to come as they were planting. As in the reading she says, ""As if oblivious to the cold, he mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. Thats the reason why I believed that they were not prepared for the winter.",0
"Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone. First of all a oerson doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also if the liberian should know whats appropiate for the library. And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area.     A person does't go to the library to see something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study and to have a quiet time. And the people that go to use the library for a resourse, should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie or magazine, because of what the autor says in the writeing. People might get offended and stop going to the library.     Also the liberian is incharged of the items he wants to display in his library. If the liberian feel that a book its okay to be displayed he can dispay it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. And if the book is resourceful for study the liberian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it.     Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be a law that does not allow offencive literature, music, movies etc... In libraries. Now this days people are allowed to donate items of litereature or intertainment to libraries, but i think that people should make sure that the items they are donateing are okay to be displayed.     So yes I believe that offensive materials shoud be removed from the libraries. Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be incharged of what he or she wants to dislay. Aand last stuff like that should not even be in a public area",0
"In the 1930's the world was evolveing and new technology's were comeing of age. One of these tecnology's was the Dirigible and some people thougt to expand it's use. One of these idea's was the moring mast on the Empire State building. This was a great idea but the things that stood in it's way made it impossible. A major problem was the safty, consdiring it was 1,250 feet up. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If this thing caught on fire, everyone inside would burn to death or crass into the ground and kill everyone under it. Another huge problem was the winds and ease of pushing it off corse. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These winds made it simply impossible for this to happen. One problem that should have bee looked at from the beging was law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airship's flying too low over urban areas."" CAPS1 this moring Mast was a fantastic idea, there were to many things standing in it's way.",0
The author concludes the story with this paragraph because heshe is trying to put across the message that the plant shows a symbol of new beginings which is a symbol of saengs vowe. Also in the story caring for the plant teaches saeng responsablity in obtaining her license by care for the plant it will teach her patients and that she needs to learn from mistakes made.,0
"In this memoir it talks about what the true meaning of selflessness and a home really is. At the beginning of this memoir they talk about how their parents knew the struggles of a life. And would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet. It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house.Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive. His parents loved to cook and taught Narciso how to. They also play traditional Cuban music. Also, they taught him to be selfless. They would invite people over even if they weren't the same race because it didn't matter to them.",0
The author's mood that he wanted you to feel was that your family and house was loving. he mentions a lot that his parents would let friends and CAPS1 come eat at dinner table for because they would help the authors family in the long run. The mood shows that the author liked his home life growing up and that his family admired were they werer from.,0
"Are you offended when you read a book and your eyes cross over a swear word? Does it bother you to hear them with your own ears? No matter how hard you try, you can not avoid the harsh language of today's society.      Have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book? Many books in today's libraries have offensive language. Sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader, but in other cases the reader MONTH1 be offended.     In my personal view, if you do not like the language of the book, put it back on the shelf. The author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written, not the way you would like to see it. Some material MONTH1 be inappropriate for younger readers. The maturaty level of the reader definitely makes a difference when discussing censorship.     For example, I am sure many parents have a problem with the movie 'The CAPS1' for its use of alcohol and drugs. Many people find this movie funny and entertaining. Should this movie be taken of the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs?      These words and actions we try to censor are not going away. We see and hear them in everyday life, no matter where you MONTH1 be. So if you don't like the language in the book, choose a different one",0
"Removal of Books      If there is a book that someone takes offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken of shelves?No, even though people MONTH1 find things in books offensive, they should not remove the books off shelves.      When i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'A CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3'. I searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help, the privilage to read the book has been taking away. The book was no longer allowed in elementry schools, due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive. After many reports about the book, the book was taken out of the library. For me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book.        If you find a book offensive keep CAPS3 to yourself and dont read the book, they shouldnt be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. Many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not others MONTH1 like them.         I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want, books are made to be read and looked at. If books are being taking away then very less books will be read. But the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and published.          The same has to do with music, movies, magazines, ect, they all are made for a reason and should be checked out. CAPS3 is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reveiwing, ect, even the things people MONTH1 find offensive, they MONTH1 teach lessons.",0
"I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. CAPS3-CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (CAPS3-CAPS2) - means CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change.",0

Most of the time I would be playing games so time goes by fast, if I dont play games then I eat a snack, play with my baby cusihs, PERSON1, and sleep. After awhile of that I sit back and relax. The whole trip is NUM2 hrs but by doing all that it seems to be more like NUM4 or NUM5 hrs.",0
"In the excerpt  The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that it was strictly hard for architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire Building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. Many dilemmas and complications the builders faced. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work.",0

Then it took the doctor NUM5 minutes for my turn to be done and over with. Then he has to talk to my mom that comes my time with lls.

"I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top NUM1 reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project. You can do on the wikepedia to help find information about the battle of LOCATION1 and other important history. one example is I went to american history.com to find good information about CAPS1 alley CAPS2 and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping alot but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from CAPS3.C CAPS4 so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week. There was my NUM1 main reasons why people should have a computer. They can find research, online schools, and online shopping stores. This can help people understand computers.",0
"I'm really sick and my head really hurts at this moment while having to write this paper, so please take CAPS1 easy on me.      Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imaginiation, taken in whatever direction they so choose for CAPS1 be to be taken. The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less then lonesome trash floating the winding streets if CAPS1 were censored.       CAPS1 is almost like when watching television; your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way, that movie is way to scary for them, plus CAPS1 shows some nudity. If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch CAPS1. In a library though, your mother might not always be there to pre-read your books for you. So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to, or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about CAPS1 of course.      The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous. Of course I would not like to see PERSON1: CAPS1 in my childrens section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections. Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non on the other side. The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them",0
"The mood created by the author is your family will always be there for you, a quote from the story is ""I will never forget how my parents made this simple house into a homeThe mood might also be there are always better opertunities in life. What I mean is that Narciso Rodriguez's parent's moved to LOCATION1 for a better opertunity for their kids. ""It was here were I learned the real definition of ""family""."" ""And for this I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love .""",0
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesnt give up and that nature gives CAPS1 strength. The conclusion shows that Saeng doesnt give up by saying that she is going to take the test again, even though she failed it earlier that day. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives her strength because it reminds her of where they used to live and her grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence.",0
"I do in deed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries, or places where young people can see it. Things, such as pornagraphic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it. I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things.     I personaly have been in a movie rental shop, and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see. Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight, and requested if wanted.     I also have a religious view on all of this. I know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop, or library ought to respect me and my religion. PERSON1 in the CAPS1 says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so. We need to have the same aspect on life. If something causes someone else harm we should not do it.     This is an issue that we face every day, and the reason I am using pornagraphic material is because it is everywhere. If I am standing in the ORGANIZATION1 check out line I see the people magazines and I find it verry offensive!     I will say though, if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want. I just find it untollerable to post these materials were viewers who do not want to see them have to see them.",0
"One day in the CAPS1, I had to sit for two hours cause I had to come for taking out my stitches. And there a lot of people, we stay there a very long time, cause there were only NUM1 docters and this lady took so long.

"I think that computers have a positive effect on people because you can communicate with different places around the world. Store things on them, and use them for entertainment. Computers have a positive effect because you can communicate with other people around the world. This is good because instead of calling people you can go on computer and talk to them for free. Long distance phone calls cost a lot. But if you can just go on your computer and talk to them there's going to be no charge. Being able to talk to other people over the internet is very useful and fun. If there wasnt a computer people would be talking to as much people and there social life would be bad making there life not as exciting. This is one reason why I think that computer have a positive effect on people. Another reason why computers give a positive effect in people if you have a lot of paperwork that is just lieing around is in the way. Well if you have a computer there are featers that your able to store thing and because much more organized. Being more organized there is less stress one you start to feel better about lossing things and being able to find them. This is why I think that computers are very great and useful. The last reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people is that people can use it for entertainment. Computers can do many things like play game, listen to music, watch videos, and chat with your friends. Being able to play games for free on your computer is awesome. If you cant aford to get a game system them you are able to go on your computer and play pretty much what ever game or close to the game that you want to play. A computer can also play music. You can have CAPS1 and download musics to something or go to web sites that have musical on them. Also you can do video chats with your friends if they live far away. I hope that I convinced you to like computers more and think that they are great and have a positive effect on people. Being able to play games, store thing, and chat with other people is pretty amazing.",0
In this story the cyclist is going through a desert of California. This is a reason why he is very limited on water supply. It is really hot which would cause him to drink a lot more water. He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasnt as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then it started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider says The sun was beginning to beat down. This would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was. This was in the morning so he didnt realize it but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated.,0

"In this memoir, the mood is very light hearted and kind. It gives you a feeling of peace and community.Several times the author tries to show appreciation.

As a result of this, while reading you get a feeling of peace and kindness.Because of his repeated display of gratitude, the mood is light hearted and unserious.",0
"The location of a cyclists ride affects the persons attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst.The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked brackish. So, setting can break a cyclist.",0
"Rodriguez creates a greatful and playful mood in this memoir.

In paragraph NUM1, the author writes about the closeness and kindness of his neighborhood. He talks about how everyone was an immigrant and faced segregation, but were always willing to lend a helping hand. Towards the end, in paragraph six Rodriguez is greatful to his parents for the love and sacrifices for him. In conclusion, Rodriguez adores the home his parents created for him.",0
In building the mast and docking to the empire state building the constructers faced major problems. The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past.,0
"In many ways computers have been very useful to the human rare. They can been used to look up information, talk to family and friends music etc. Don't you think people are wasting more time on the computer instead of getting exercise. It's clear that computers can do just about anything want than to do. But why spend your time on the computer when you can spend time with your family. Playing sports, or getting some fresh air. I think computers have a positive effect on people and negative effect one of the positive effects is being able to talk to your friends. i know sometimes we are not able to see them as much in school. In my opinion I think it is a great way so you can catch up on funny times that you can and friends shared. Now here comes the negative effect. Mang kids get bulled and picked by other kids over the internet. This can cause other kids to have a low self esteem, and cause dangerous events in the future. When it comes to computer they have saved many people life. Some of these ways are finding cures to harmful deases. Computers have information when serious weather storms are coming and prepare us for the weather. Wouldn't you agree that computers have played a huge role in our lifes. Sometimes we she take a break from them and enjoy nature. So have fun with technology and don't forget to stay active too.",0
"Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, youre quite likely to make a crucial mistake andor degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when youre waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates arent doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that youve lost, and youve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened Ive experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what Im trying to say is that when youre patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isnt a bundle of roses all the time, so soon or later, youre going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isnt human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, Im certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently.",0
"Have you ever been working on a paper, or reading something and theres that word you've never heard before? And you just cant figure it at? There where a computer can help you. Yes, some people do waste all their time, online but they have issues. Computers help us with all of our school projects and get research. You can CAPS3 reconnect woth old friends that you havent sen in years, learned many good things with the internet and computers. First off we would not be able to do some of the things we do without computers. CAPS1 us school projects, I use ORGANIZATION1 word and powerpoint all the time. Our teachers prefer us to do that instead of handwriting evert thing. Getting information on the computer is so much faster and easier I mean the time it would take, you to look up the word ""elephants"" the encyclopedia is probably NUM1 times more that it takes to it in can google. Plus there about NUM2 1NUM2 seconds google call all up millions of websites just what ""elephants"". Another reason way computers are very beneficial is you can reconnect the old friends you havent seen or talked for a years. You can CAPS3 meet new CAPS1 us dating and facebook especially is three things and theres websites like twitter where you can follow celebrities and CAPS2, computers are internet gives great information people. Some kids take online CAPS3 CAPS4 that does recieves around computers to do really have a choice. So in conclusion, computers can be very beneficial to lets of people I know its not a good thing to sit there all day and play cmputer games, but we lets of things accomplished, like school projects, or any project really. Its CAPS3 nice to meet up with someone you havent talked to in a while sometimes. We have learned many great things from the internet. I hopre you consider my opinion.",0

"More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Profesor PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age NUM2. I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year I had a friend who weighed NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This MONTH1 not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that PERCENT2 children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse.",0
"Studies show that PERCENT1 of people that are addicted to computers are not fit and don't play sports. I have a computer at home and I know how much fun it is talking to your friends on CAPS1 or whatever you talk to your friends are. If you're not fit and don't enjoy the beauty of nature you will not know how to live a good life. I'm not saying that you won't get anywhere in life, but it won't be much interesting. I play lots of sports and I love them all. I am fit and yes I do like going on CAPS1 and chatting with my friends, but thats not as important as is breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends. Yes, the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff. I mean you could learn about faraway places with out going there, but then what would be the fun of that. For an example, if you go to LOCATION1 for snowboarding, dont you feel great when your going down that CAPS3? I know I do instead of being home on the computer. Nature is beautiful I am thankful to god of giving us that beauty and all animals. It makes life better, georgus. I love taking hikes with my family up a CAPS3. That fresh air you can't get anywhere else or even riding your CAPS5 up a trail, the beauty of that is unbelievable, you can't find it any other place. Doctors show that PERCENT2 of people that spend time more than NUM1 hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision. All those people didn't want poor vision but beacuse of the computer they got that wich really stinks. Now as you can you see computers really can change your life. So that's your discision. Pick wrong from right, all up to YOU. Now make it.",0
"CAPS1 name is PERSON1 and CAPS2 writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society. Did you know that NUM1 out of NUM2 homes have at least NUM3 computer in their home? Well who wouldnt! Computers let you learn more because you can research more, its quicker than having to go and look things up in the library, and with tools like CAPS3 and facebook you can talk to people you normally dont get to see. Computers let you learn more because of the internet. With the internet you can use websites like google, LOCATION1 and LOCATION2. When you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life. For example, if I was looking up a chocolate chip recipe and I tried different things to make it unique then sold it, just think that life changed with one click on the computer. Also if I had to research a topic for CAPS1 history project then I would go onto the computer, to google and then type in CAPS1 topic and be overwelmed by getting the info that I needed and got an at on the project thats how computers help you learn more. Computers are very quick I can make NUM4 powerpoints slides CAPS6 with useful information in the time it would take me to go to the library, find a good book and write enough information to make powerpoint slide: on overage PERCENT1 of people turn to the computer to find useful information. When I was doing CAPS1 social studies project TIME1 I had to find out what the CAPS4 flag looked like. So, instead of trying to possibly find a book on the library. I just hopped on google and clicked images and clicked images and typed in CAPS4 flag. Within seconds CAPS1 screen was CAPS6 with real and edited pictures of the CAPS4 flag. It is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer. So would you rather be stuck in a library looking up information forever or out enjoying your life because you saved all that time by going on the computer? Have you ever heard of facebook, myspace, CAPS3, or twitter? Well they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer. When I am CAPS3 or facebook I can talk to people that I might not get to see all the time one of CAPS1 friend from camp lives in CAPS10 so I dont get to see her alot so with the wonderful invention of facebook I could talk to her all the time. Just think without the computer facebook would have never been invented so I would have most likely lost touch with a good friend. Also when I go on the computer. I have the option signing onto something called CAPS3 or email. With this I can talk to people and get wacky emails. That would happen if the computer wasnt invented. So dont you want information to be easier to research? Quicker to find out information. And talk to friends more easily. Well lets make it NUM2 out of NUM2 homes that have a computer and help benefit society by doing your part and just getting what you need on the computer then enjoying life. Just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer.",0

A dirigible is also a ballon or blump but there different because the dirigibles can be controlled by pappellers. Another reason was the CAPS4 equpment.

"A lot of people use computers in present day. It allows family and friends to interact with eachother, research places and ideas, and lets you type a document to look neat. On the other hand, computer technology, prevents people from being active, exploring nature, and talking to family and friends in person. I want to explain to you how I feel about computers personally. I can honestly tell you that I love computers. I spend a lot of time on CAPS3, because it lets me talk to friends I sometimes don't get to see. I can even see how my cousin in LOCATION1 is doing. Computers also help me out with homework. For projects on a subject that I don't totally understand, I can just hop on my laptop, search what I need, and CAPS1!, I have my information. Then after that I can type up my report and even pick out a couple of pictures to print out, see? Computer are bangin! But I can understand the other side of the issue. Computers can be time consuming. I can admit that I've spent hours at a time on the computer. This has become a problem. Experts say that people are starting to spend to much time on the computer and less time in the real world. A perfect example is my brother. He loves the CAPS2. My mom will call him down for dinner and he'll be too engrossed in what he's doing that he will skip the meal. His friends will call him and he'll blow them off until he finishes his game. I agree that people should not spend so much time on computer. You have probably read this and thought to yourself. Well? How does she feel about it? I can honestly say, I was supposed to choose one. But here's the thing. I like my laptop. I'm addicted to CAPS3, But, I still play sports, I talk to my family, and I even like to take walks through the words or on the beach. I neutral, like CAPS4 from CAPS5. Scientist say computers have positive effect on people. Some experts say they're concerned computers have a negative effect on people. PERSON1 says they are both right. Computers are wonderful. They are one of the most growing technologies in our world. But we don't need to spend CAPS6 of our time on them. I hope you understand my point on this issue.",0

"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, he included many stories about his ""family"" and parents. The stories, along with the parentheses expressing more of his opinion, created three main moods in the memoir. The moods PERSON2 created were happiness, humor, and kindness.     The mood of happiness is expressed when Narciso is talking about his friends in the community and family. At the table, when at least one of his extended family members joined him regularly, Narciso set a mood that was very happy. During those meals that him and his family had, they would often laugh.     Laughing and humor were another specific mood of Narciso's memoir. In the parentheses, Narciso put a personal touch of his experiences. For example, when talking about 'rich culinary skills', the parentheses said, 'and for which I am eternally grateful.' The extra information had a hint of humor and kindness.     Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a kind tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were. He also had a kind tone when talking about the friendship in his community. Friendships like, extending 'hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearily in need'.     In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir there were the tones of happiness, humor, and kindness. All three moods were involved, one way or another, with his most important thing, family.",0
"I strongly think we should have no more computers rather then looking on the computer. I strongly think this because this could cause serious damage to the eyes. My opinion for having computers is I don't think we should have them because you don't get enough exercise. You would just sit there looking at the computer all day. You would probley get all fat through the course of the year. You would be like a couch potato. My next opinion is we won't be able to get out of the house to see the beautiful nature. Like all the trees, flowers, wild life animals too. If you don't go outside there will be no fresh air for you. My last opinion is if we have computer. We won't be able to hang out with friends and family. You wont be able to see how big your family is. Or how small they are still small. Well these are my opinion's for having computers.",0
"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", is a mixture of happiness, relaxation, and gratefulness, even thought the memoir sometimes states how PERSON1' parents had to give up their jobs in Cuba, and how overt racism was normal and segregation prevailed in the United States at the time, giving the mood as sadness, the article mainly consists Of happy memories. An example of this can be found throughout the story, especially in the ending paragraph when Narciso Rodriguez sums up the memoir and expresses how grateful he was toward his parents and the childhood he had. Also in the third and fourth paragraphs when he talks about his neighbors and how everybody got along with eachother, and how they frequently had meals together, I find the mood to be relaxing in paragraph three and four also, but mainly in paragraph NUM1 when he talks about his kitchen and the smells, aromas, and music that used to dance through the air. The over all mood of the memoir could be considered gratefullness. I could be considered gratefulness because Narciso Rodriguez always states how grateful he is for his parents and child hood.",0
"New technology, especially in aviation,requires work to be done, thus causing many obstacles to overcome. In order to make this mooring mast on the Empire State building a success, the builders would need to know how to keep the dirigible hooked to the building and able to set passengers on and off. A quote from the text supporting this would be ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". (6). But the passengers were not the only obstacle the builders had to surpass. The stress a dirigible would put on the building would be too great, meaning they also had to remodel the actual building. The text supports this with, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (NUM1). Even with all these modifications, however, the mooring mast was doomed to failure for reasons the builders could not fix.",0

As you can see, Narciso has a great admiration to his Cuban tradition and showed it through the warmth he provoked in this sentence. Next, Narciso stresses how regardless of mixed heritage, everyone in the neighborhood came together like family, which creates a happy, safe feeling in the reader.

"The CAPS1 Of Laughter In CAPS2 CAPS3 me laughter is important, we all laugh in our lives. It's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough CAPS3 listen and pay attention. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime. For my friends and I, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every moment of it. My friend PERSON1 and I have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since. what has kept our CAPS2 strong and still alive today, is the memories we have created through laughter. One memory I always seem CAPS3 remember though, is the first time we had gone inner-tubing together.   There have been many memories made between PERSON1 and I that we remember because of the laughter we shared. Yet the memory that always remains dominate, is when we had gone inner-tubing for the first time. It was our seventh grade DATE1 and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. Now this did not really work out because I had CAPS3 babysit a lot, but she was a good friend and understood. So when we did hang out it was always so much fun. Now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any CAPS2. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. That DATE1 we would hang out at each others house's and go places together. Then one day ORGANIZATION1's parent's had decided that they wanted CAPS3 take a trip CAPS3 the lake and go boating. PERSON1's family invited me CAPS3 come along, and so I asked and I was able CAPS3 go with their family CAPS3 the lake. I had been boating before, and CAPS3 the lake that we were going too. What I was not expecting, was for PERSON1 and I CAPS3 go inner-tubing. It was exciting, and nerve-racking all at the same time; I had never laughed so much with LOCATION1 in my life.Going inner-tubing turned out CAPS3 be one of the best memories we had ever made together. During the entire DATE1 whenever possible,we had gone inner-tubing, for me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. It was our new story CAPS3 tell everyone and we were both proud of it. When inner-tubing we had learned CAPS3 work together and it helped our CAPS2 a lot in a way. Also when inner-tubing we got CAPS3 the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it.  That DATE1 we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all CAPS3 laughter. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. If not for laughter I do not know where my CAPS2 with PERSON1 would stand. And because of that, I believe that laughter is important in any relationship or CAPS2. It's a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great.",0

"I do not think people use the computer to much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running. Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll, inventory, e-mailing the works about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, tricks, etc. Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like CAPS2 people use CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use aim to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any affects on anyone because we all use it to our benifits.",0
"People believe that censorship is impotant in Libraries. They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter.

I feel that booksmusicmoviesmagazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way. So we shouldn't always try to control every one we should just let them be on the shelfs and let them or there parents decide if it's innaporpate or not.in conclusion i feel again that they should be on the shelfs and people should be allowed to listenread whatever they want to. if it doesnt harm anyone or themselfs then let it go on and happen. let them do what they want to",0
"The CAPS1 of the ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the law. There was a law in place preventing airships flying too low over urban cities. This made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. Another isue they had was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium Hydrogen is extremely flammable and it would be catastrophic if a dirigible blew up over New York City. The last problem they ORGANIZATION1 was the wind. At the top of the building the winds shifted due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied up the back end would move around.

"From the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attenting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the designing as well as the cost of this project could encounter problems. Such as, ""add stress to the building's frame."" If the mass interfered with the frame of the building, then changing the material of the building could cost ""over sixty thousand dollars!"" In addition, safety was a major component when trying to construct the mooring mast. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen...and hydrogen is highly flammable."" New York is a very populated area, which means when building a mooring mast, safety must be considered into perspective. Lastly, their were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities. As it states in the excerpt, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Overall, when constructing the mooring mast, many builders were blind to the potential problems, making the project unsuccessful.",0

That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing.",0
"The definition of patients is, when someone is in a car, & is going a long distance trip and you dont ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patients is you are at a store, & someone is in front of you with whopping overload of stuff in there kart, &you dont get mad at the person that is called patients. Also if you are teaching something to somebody & they keep messing it up and you dont get mad and you keep trying to teach them thats patients. Another example of patients is if someone has CAPS1, & they have a hard time paying attention and you dont get frustrated with them then you are patient with that person. Also if the person just walks off and dosnt pay you no mind and you still try to teach or show them something thats a sign of patients. Sometimes patients because, if you maybe want to have a job as a theropist you need a lot of patients. Those are some definitions of patients.",0
"In Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotion connection to the memories and flashbacks that the Hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories. Later on in the story, she takes the plant to her mother. At first PERSON1 is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughters actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she didnt pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because wants the reader to see that because the hibiscuses is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, she will have a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing.",0
"Losing CAPS1 to ORGANIZATION1 are a huge part of daily life these days, which is good for businesses, and schools but for people just looking to pass time, computers are a dangerous choice. Yes, computers are a way of communication, and are helpful if a student forgets their homework or an assignment, but when it comes to boredome computers are bad. Social networking is scary in reality and too many young people are exposing themselves in making CAPS2 or a CAPS3 page. Also excersise is a big issue now and you aren't getting any by at a computer. On the other hand though, computers open up new worlds to people. You can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results. Computers like anything else, are fine in moderation, but too much of one thing just isn't healthy. Websites like CAPS2, or CAPS3, or CAPS6, are scary when it comes to privacy. There is very little privacy offered and your page can just be put out in the public. Also these w ebsites are addicting. You MONTH1 just want to log on to check your notifications but you can end up on the computer for NUM1 to NUM2 hours without even realizing it. Other pass time could be running on a tredmill or jogging there dont have benefits. All you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision. It would be okay to be on the computer for 1NUM1 hour a day but not using to the internet. Websites can be a way to find computer time. Edline is homework or an assignment. Google is helpful for research or vocab work. When websites like these are the focus on computer time, it is much more productive. Overall, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people if as many people that use computers balanced that time with time to excersise, they would all be better off.",0
The author conludes her story with this paragraph because it really shows the heart and the perseveriance Saeng has. Also it tells a lot about her carter and ends the story in a strong mood. That is why she ended the story the way she did.,0
"There was a person named PERSON1. He wanted a video game for his CAPS1- box NUM1. But, his dad just got laid-off and his mom had a low-paying job. Since they had very little money, he couldnt buy the game. A few months later, his dad finally found a job at CAPS2. But, PERSON1 still didnt have enough money for the game. A few more months passed, PERSON1 finally had enough for the game. His mom took him to the store to buy it. He was very excited. He ended up loving the game very much.",0

"Censorship in Libraries     I know as well as everyone else does, that you can find almost anything, reading related, in the library. There is all different kinds of stuff in there. From children's books, to love stories and people's magazines, newspapers, movies, and music. Everyone is welcome in the library, of course, but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want?     I personally think it's a good idea to have all of this stuff in the library, for anyone, even though some of it's not very appropriate. For people who sit at home and don't have a library, maybe they want to know about something specific and the first place they would think about going is the library. Nobody can really help with what people MONTH1 find in the library but i think it's a good idea to keep that kind of stuff in a public place. You could go on the internet to get whatever information you need, yeah, but, what if the internet doen't have what you're looking for? I like books better then internet myself. Anybody can put information on the computer, but atleast when it's in a book, it's true, because it has to be published and read by someone that wouldn't let a book with false information be sent out to the public.     If the libraians are worried about underaged kids getting into books that they're not suppose to, then put it somewhere where they can't reach. Put the adult books in the adult section, and don't let the little kids go in that area. You could always put them up high too so the kids wouldn't even know they was there. All the libraries I've ever been to, had their own sections, the adults would go to their section, and the kids would go to their's. If the parents are afraid of what their kids will find, then keep them home and don't let them go to the library. Make your own at home, then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there",0
"Have you ever thought about people's veiws on certain technolgy? While some people say that others spend too much time on their computers, and are waisting their time, I think computers can help us with many different things. They can help with homework, interacting with people, and even help us with exercising. You'll find that in the end, computers end up as benefits for everyone. For many students, they need computers to help them understand their subjects. There are certain websights that give online lessons. Along with that, they have online books, so if they forget their real ones, they can still do their homework. My math teacher, PERSON2, is always saying,""CAPS1 into the online sight."" I've found that it really helps me when I'm struggling with my work. We can also ask our friends with help if we still CAPS4't understand. That's not all we can do. There are certain sights like CAPS2 and CAPS3 where we can interact with other people. You can talk to them when they're out of town and have no cell-phone. You can also tak when the phone is being used and you have something importain to tell them, such as helping them with their homework. When there's no telephone reception between each other, they can still talk over one million people in the LOCATION1 use these sights. People are wrong when they say it takes their time away from exercising. Many websights give good tips on how to lose weight. The show many dieting plans such as PERSON3 or PERSON1. Not only that, but they also have exercise plans. It's not the computer's fault, it's the people who CAPS4't ""stick"" with exercising. Also, the computer reccomends many great gyms you can join, like LOCATION2 fitness. CAPS4't you think that's a good ""deal?"" CAPS4't listen to those other people stick with my opinion that computers are benefits for everyone. They can help us with many things, above and beyond. I can't imagine life without them. Most everyone uses computers! Thank you for reading.",0
"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One obstacle they faced was nature itself. It says in the exerpt that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" This could have led to major accidents if the dirigibles were allowed to dock here. Another obstacle they faced was that these dirigibles could not fly to low over urban cities. It says in the excerpt that ""these was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" But before the idea was even dropped, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building. The first one could not reach the building because of forceful winds. The second airship attempted a stunt to drop off a bundle of news papers. They didn't have the right equipment so they had to have a worker catch the bundle of papers that were attached by a rope. These obstacles were very important to be construction of the mast because it's probably saved the lifes not only the aviators but the people that lived in urban cities below.",0
"To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. CAPS2 example PERCENT1 of americans play soccer. In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you MONTH1 miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect CAPS1's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that PERCENT2 of children are obeased because of computer games. You MONTH1 be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out CAPS2 the computer. Now he way NUM1 pounds and he is only NUM2. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to CAPS2 example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there CAPS2 callage I garentee your going to put off school work, CAPS3 and other CAPS4 that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time CAPS2 bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day CAPS2 one week can CAPS5 your vision from a NUM4 NUM4 to NUM6 NUM6. If you keep it up now it MONTH1 not seem bad but NUM8 hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad CAPS2 your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer.",0
"Taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech.  There is not a point to it. People in this country have the right of speech. Along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard.  An author's opinions MONTH1 be offensive to some but does that mean he or she should not have a voice?  Writers get their ideas from somewhere society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjer up, taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly citizens of the LOCATION1 have the right to make their own choices; that being if you don't like a book don't check it out.     Writers MONTH1 state things that to some degree MONTH1 offend one in a million people.  Others see it as freedom of speech and writing.  An author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders.  But if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing.  Some books MONTH1 be fictional but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else.  Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers.  So when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it they got it from the way people truly are in the world.       Banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provacitive language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words. Kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex.  Reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways.  If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves society still will not change.  There is no perfect society.     Setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone.  If an idividual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing that person should not check that author's books out from the library.  No single person is forced to read a book they are offended by.  Getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence. The library is not liable for the feelings of the readers.  If the reader does not like the book they are able to close it.  No one has glued their fingers to it.       Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to.  Banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things.  Society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere, taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if some one does not like a book they should not read it",0

""Its. saying its the right time for a secnd chance.

"In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed it showed signs of problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's frame. They next found that safety was an issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flamable. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. There was high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons then pros.",0

"Benefits of laughter Laughter has always been a big part of my life. when you laugh you are having fun. Having fun puts you in a good mood. When my friends and I get into arguments, or disagreements laughter can be our mediator. Laughter can make a bad situation slightly bearable. Laughter even has great health benefits like working out your core, and lungs. One of my best friend's mom recently passed away right before CAPS1. Her name was CAPS2. She was like a second mother to me for several reasons. I had known her for NUM1 years, and for a small amount of time i even lived at her house. She was basically a mother figure to me, because i don't live with my birth mother. I use to see her almost everyday, because of my friend PERSON1. He is NUM2 and we hang out just about every day. I remember the morning he called me and told me his mom was dead on the floor in her bedroom. I ran over there as fast as i could when i saw the ambulance lights. My other friend PERSON2 spent the TIME1 at PERSON1 house the TIME1 his mom died. When i made it to PERSON1's house he instantly started to cry on my shoulder. It was wise not to try and make PERSON1 happy with laughter, because nothing is really funny when a loved one passes away. As time went on PERSON2 and I started to think of ways to cheer up LOCATION1. We wanted to get his mind off of his mother. Wouldn't you know it the best way to do so was laughter. I'm the jokester in my group of friends. So some how i have the ability to make people laugh without thinking. I'm more of a doer not a thinker. Id rather see my friends in a good mood than in a bad mood. If people are in a bad mood there is this bad aura or vibe you can just feel it. Its a very undesirable feeling. Laughter cheers up my friends when they are feeling down. Laughter helped make a bad situation like my friends mom dying into a slightly more comfortable situation. Laughter along with trust, and respect are CAPS3 bring my friends and I together.",0

CAPS6 hasn't always been easy for her an me, but the way we know how CAPS8 cope is CAPS8 laugh at everything an everyone, not in a bully or make fun of kind a way, but a good way. Laughin for me an my PERSON1 comes like a second nature CAPS8 us, CAPS6's what keeps us going an know that everything will be okay.

People don't think of laughter as a cure they think of CAPS6 as something you do after you hear a joke. Laughter is so much more then people give CAPS6 credit for.

The mood created by the author in the memoir would be describe happy and thankful. I say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless.

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasnt so hot, then he wouldnt of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didnt help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist.",0
"The empire state building was high in the air, (NUM1 ft) the problems were is that the building moves while it's in the air, and if you have something that is weighting around the heavy fifty-thousand pounds maybe more than the building might rip off if there is a big windstorm. The dock sounded like a good idea but you would need a winch and you would have to put some big clamps on the building to secure the balloon or dirigible to dock and refuel. In paragraph NUM2, PERSON1 of the building's architectural office said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" If Irving ever decides to put a blimp up and make an air station then make new technology. Who know's in the future we could have cars that fly through air, why not have balloons attached to buildings.",0
The reason why the author concludes this type of senerario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and or a situation in this particular author you know son but if you get it straight youll open your eyes and see that its your time to shine you might as well grab it before you loose your chance you only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people.,0
The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll of how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more.,0

"First of all the Empire State Building wasn't made for landing dirigibles on top of it. The architects had to redesign the whole top of the building. When they did that they never bothered to put proper landing gear down for the dirigibles. It was a bad day out, weatherwise, then it would be very difficult to land a dirigible without the proper landing gear. The dirigible is over NUM1 feet long, without a very large landing service, it would be dangerous for the people in the dirigible, the people on the ground, and the people helping land the dirigible.",0
"CAPS2 I understand your one trying to decide whether or not computers are bad for people. I for one thing that computers are turning our society anti-social, we are becoming obese, and there is alot of cyber bullying that happens via computers. You can learn about all this and more if read on. CAPS2 a stated earlier computers many problems in LOCATION1's social lives. You see CAPS2 much CAPS2 PERCENT1 of our population spends at least NUM1 hours a ween on the computer. When doing this they are typically . watching videos or tweeting a friends. This MONTH1 all swim like a activity but it is really pulling us away from our social lives. There are many sites that allow you to chat with your friends and leave messages on their ""wall"" but is that really communicating? In a way it is but it is taking away social skills that we will need later on. You can't get a job by instant messaging a person, you have to talk face to face. But how will we be able to do that if we only email and CAPS3? Plus while so much you will be prone to using in , thus you with, nothing but a bad grade. Now we to problem that we see occuring all over . You the work on the computer. This activity what , they monitor, lets you at , everyday, since he comes home and plays on the computer and more time exercising. Finally we come to my last issue, cyber bullying. Over PERCENT2 of CAPS4 teens will be faced with some sort of cyber bullying in their life. When teens sion up for facebook and twitter they are signing up for depression. When a teen starts to get bullied they usually become sad which then leads them grades to go lower due to lack of concentration and that leads them to be more depressed and that could make them either commit suicide or join gangs andor start making bad . But we can prevent this if we the of time people out NUM2 spend on computers. And I think benifit that. In conclusion I believe that is we are bad for society. I think them is we the amount of time could be lives. I think that if you look deep down into what it to say how you will understand why we need to do healthier LOCATION1?",0
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times PERSON1 had in his house. For example, PERSON1 says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir.",0

"Library CAPS1:                                    CAPS2 or bad?      It is a very rare occasion that i go to the library, i'm a typical guy, i like sports, video games, and hanging with my friends. When im not in school i try to stay away from everything that reminds me of it, like libraries. Those very rare occasions when i do go to the library, for a summer reading book for school, i usually browse around to see what they have on the shelves. Some of the stuff i see at libraries catches my eye, and not because it looks like a CAPS2 book, but because it's shocking to see what they allow to be even put on the shelves.     On the book shelves that i have walked by i have seen romance novels and they arent as bad as i would have thought, at first they catch my eye with the titles because they are usually kind of out of the ordinary. I feel that these books aren't innapropriate for young adults, but younger kids and pre teens should'nt be reading them. So as long as there is seperation between the kids section and adult section then i think it is completely okay to have romance novels and any other graphic novels up on the shelves because they are types if literature.     Now magazines on the other hand can be taken either way. Gossip magaziines can be entertaining, but they can also be highly offensive. The problem with magazines alot of the writing is people's opinions and they could be talking in a very negative wasy about some people or some things. I think its up to the library to make a decision on that but if someone complains about it i think the library should be kind enough to take it off of the shelf. They are also magazines that show off models in swimsuits and clothes, and i feel that if the guys or girls are nude at all in the magazine they should either be in a back room and have people request to see them or they shouldn't be in the library at all. I've seen parents walk into a library and their son asked them why that magazine had a half naked lady on it and i just felt like it was highly irresponsible for the library to just leave these magazines out for kids to see them and then bug there parents all day about what they saw at the library.     Music and movies are not that hard to control from them getting into the wrong hands. Now a days CAPS3 cases for music have stickers on them that say parental advisory, so i feel that the library should be able to have any types of music on the shelves because music now has warnings on the cases. Movies are the same way, they have ratings. If the librarian see's a NUM1 year old kid trying to check out a rated CAPS4 movie then she should be fired, because there is cleary no reason why she would do that. Excuses cant come into play here because if you look at the rating and then you look at the person you can usually see if the movie is appropriate for them or not. Now CAPS5 movies should not be in libraries at all, libraries are supposed to be a place to get something nice to read or listen to. Pornography in a library is like haveing strippers in school, it is just not ethical.      In conclusion i feel that cencorship in libraries is a CAPS2 thing to have. If libraries organize things well and make sure kids aren't in ares that they shouldn't be then everything should be fine",0
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line ..

One more reason she MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line  Through the quiet repition of season upon season..

My opinion on the effects computer have on people. A good effect that computer have on people that it teaches them how to have good hand-eye coordination CAPS1 if they work as a doctor on anything that needs it that would help them do better in their jobs. Another reason why computers have good effects on people it let them chat with their famile memebers case if your family went to a whole new countries for a trip then you beable to see how there doing and it's like there. Another one would be that you could learn about another states and countries around the world.  It tell you how many people like there and what type of culture they have when it found probably now when I want to learn about texas I look up information on it and tell me when it was found the capital and how many people live there. Another good thing that you could play games with your friends like all types shooting games racing sport arcade all type.,0
"Should books, magazines, music, and movies be removed from shelves, if found offensive? I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people. If it only offends a few people, then I think the answer should be no.     Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people? They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things. It's almost like when people were segragted by race. The segragation led to fights between the people. How would you feel if segragation was still around? You might be upset and find it unfair, because you cannot do some things. That is probabally how some people feel when they get offended by the media.     Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people? They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong. They could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong. If there was nothing out there that offended anyone, how would younger generations learn how to decided what is right and wrong?     In my opinion, it all depends on how many people are offended by it. There are ups and downs either way it goes. If you removed everything that offended anyone, it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves. This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view, the point of view that is perfect for everybody. The way I see it, that point of view does not exsist. Therefore, I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone, we would not have a media. However, if we did not remove anything that was offensive, serious issues could occur. For example, fights could break out or wars could even start, depending on how many people were offended. The last thing we need in our society is fighting. So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no.",0
"The setting in the story Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page NUM1 it says, a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldnt cool down, This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there.",0

"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles ran on hydrogen verses helium and if it were to ever to catch on fire there would be pedestrians everywhere below that would be in grave danger. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Because the dirigible would be docked so high with little back control, the fierce winds would be a huge issue. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible were to dock there it would also be breaking laws.

"I feel that the mood (s) created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud, and grateful.

He said (in paragraph NUM1) that growing up in his environment istilled a great sence of family. His family welcomed other refugees from cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country. Thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family.The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful.

"Its always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. As I was sitting at home one sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friends PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear all I could hear was a loud crying. PERSON1 wasn't saying anything to me, not one word. Even though, I repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her, PERSON1 wouldn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her anymore, I asked her to calm down and take deep breaths. Desperately, I wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because I had started to get really worry. Couple minutes later, PERSON1 started explaining to me what had happen. PERSON1 started off by telling me she was irresponsible that she didn't pay attention to what was happening around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, PERSON1 screamed that while she was home watching the CAPS1 basketball team play basketball, her dog CAPS2 got run over. The dog had actually died. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that PERSON1 would be crying over her dog. I didn't want to be rude about it and tell her what was going threw my mind at that time. Even thought that was the way I felt about the whole situation. I thought of what the words I needed to say to PERSON1 but I was confuse. Actually, it wasn't so much that I was confuse, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dog, that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale. Also, I told PERSON1 that if it made her feel any better I would buy her a new puppy. After saying that to her there was an awkward silence. My hands started to get shaky because I thought PERSON1 was mad. All of the sudden I just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk. I felt so relief that I had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me. PERSON1 wouldn't shut her mouth she just laughed and laughed and laugh hysterically. Finally, she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again. PERSON1 thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out the situation. Rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more. I was happy I made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worst. As I was laughing I told her that anytime she needed to laugh I was the person she needed to be call. Anytime, any day and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a loud laugh to her mouth. PERSON1 laughed with me and thank me one more time for making her laugh. From that day on I always like to make people laugh because I know I'm going to make them feel better. I sure love it when others make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and cant really describe. After making my friend PERSON1 laugh I found out laughter was a key element of life.",0

"i believe that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries.

The reason why I say that is because we should be able to but what ever in our books that expresses our feelings in any way shape or form.

"CAPS1 name is PERSON1 and I am a ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I believe that computers do NOT benefit society of all! In CAPS1 opinion, they make our town worse. People spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. All of these things are CAPS3 computers are doing to our society and it's time to make a stop to it! First of all, people are on the computer way too much. Teens are on social networking sites, adults are on chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. Instead of that, people should be playing outside, or going for a walk in the park. Did you know that PERCENT1 of adults are overweight? If people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows CAPS3 teens are doing on the computer. Computers have good things but they can also be bad. For example, chatrooms who knows CAPS3 kind of people are in chatrooms. Children need to be careful about CAPS3 they say or show on the internet. Instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and exercise. Second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful senery around them. Were all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice CAPS3 a beautiful day it is outside. On a nice DATE1 or DATE2 day, people should take this kids to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last DATE2 when I went to CAPS1 cousins house. CAPS1 aunt only allowed us to watch one hour as a day, that included the computer. We were outside every single day, even if we were just staring into the clouds. This kept us active and enjoy the environment. CAPS1 last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends. I know CAPS3 your thinking, when your on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. Instead of instant messaging call them. Maybe even invite them our to talk face to face. That reminds me of CAPS1 sister. When I get home, she will normally be on CAPS2. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me ""CAPS3's up?"" or ""CAPS4 was your day?"" Computers help people communicate, but they also take communication away. As you can see, I have given you three reasons why I strongly believe computers are badly ORGANIZATION1. Not only ORGANIZATION1 but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Please I'm asking you to understand that our society will crash it we don't fix this issue. So CAPS3 are you going to do about it?",0
"ORGANIZATION1, CAPS1, click, clack that the sound ORGANIZATION2 computer keys being hit right now. Computers are everywhere these days, even in the poorest places like LOCATION3. In LOCATION2. Dreadful, humble, time conservative computers are taking away the meaning and enjoyments ORGANIZATION2 life that are offered to us. Computers are our sourse CAPS5 infromation, and time CAPS5 liesure these days, but we are fogetting that there is a life away from them as well such as having family time, and taking walks in the beautiful, nature. To much use ORGANIZATION2 a computer is leading to aweful health. Computers can cause many fatal problems such as seeing and vision problems, and obisity, due to the fact that you sit all day and CAPS2't work out. Computers are like mind, and body eaters the slowly take away from you and let you cry, and weap CAPS5 the rest ORGANIZATION2 your life, CAPS2't you agree? Do you know the ORGANIZATION2 says that the second biggest leading cause ORGANIZATION2 obisity is computer? Yes that is true! I have experinced problem. While growing up. When I was NUM1 I was adictied to the computer. Day and night my eyes were guled to the computer screen. I had nothing on my mind except CAPS5 computer, my mom got mad at me and yelled at me to get away from it, but I didn't. Slowly, slowly I started to put on heavy, awful faton myself, and later I found out I was over weight CAPS5 my age. To this day I have not lost the weight I put on from using the computer, and I am sure others are to. Obesity just doesn't happen from eating to much. It also happens from not doing any cardio activities, which the computer stps us from doing. So basically the computer is unhealth. As said by PERCENT1 ORGANIZATION2 people from the state ORGANIZATION2 LOCATION1. Time consuming computers, are taking away family time from many family these days. Do you know that PERCENT2 ORGANIZATION2 families aren't getting to spend the time with each other as the wish, reason being computers? Kids are on the computer playing games, moms finding a resipe online to make CAPS5 dinner, and dad is buying another stock online. Yes that happens a lot, insded ORGANIZATION2 doing those things they could be doing something else, but no computer work is more important. My family used to spend a lot ORGANIZATION2 time together, but because ORGANIZATION2 the computer I never get to do anything with my family now. Do you know the time health ORGANIZATION2 ORGANIZATION2 say kids who spend time with their family are bound to become more better parents than who CAPS2't spend time with family. I bet you are a really good family manwomen and spend time with please take these computers away and make families come together once again. LOCATION1 has the most beautiful nature ever, the birds, the animals, the DATE1 times and the fall time. If anyone ever wants to see nature they should come to LOCATION1, but the sad thing is that the people ORGANIZATION2 LOCATION1 aren't appriating nature themselves because they are do busy with things such as computers. I know one time we went to a comp out, and we were ready CAPS5 nature and this boy brings his computer, and wouldn't you know it the whole got people forgot about nature and played with the boys computer. So many people missed out on the nature and the beautiful animals seen one the such as yellow CAPS3 through that time was amazing and it is very unfortunet that many people missed out on that event. People these days are once again not apricating nature, which one day they will regret, because ORGANIZATION2 the fact the one day you MONTH1 not be around to enjoy this got given CAPS2't let the computer tell you what to do lets be the boss and CAPS5 ourself. It is now or never the decision is in your hand, make the right decision and say no to computers. Go out their enjoy nature, spend time with you family, and get healthy.

"There are tons of books in the library that people MONTH1 find offensive to young readers today. I think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves. People have a right to read what they choose to read. There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library.     First of all, there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive.' CAPS1 removing all of these offending books, you would basically be removing half the books in the library. Most young adult books have something to do with teens, drugs, violence, and other things that would come off as offensive. These books are usually the ones that teenagers read. Just because they're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected. These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody.     Secondly, I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch. Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this purpose. Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike.      Finally, I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake. There are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known. Children wouldn't know about them, and they could be missing out on some great stories.     Everyone has an opinion, and watching out for your children is understandable. Censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people. Libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste.",0

"The mood created by the author is one of blithe and thankfullness. The reasons that it is thankful if because of the frequent refrences made by the author to the courage and bravery shown by his parents.

The last sentence of the memoir is ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" This is showing that the mood is Grateful because Narciso means that he's is thankful because they were able to turn their little house into a place of great friendships and great times.

"CAPS1 computers does have some cons but they also have a lot of pros. Some pros are they show magnificant pictures of nature and it would pictures until you want to send them by email.

"Laughter is one of the most important elements in one's life. If you're down, one smile, or laugh, causes your body to send messages throughout you body making you feel better. Scientists also say that it takes more muscles to frown than smile. I believe that this is true, because in order to frown, you have to make your whole body look like it's frowning, like your shoulders and your face, but only a little smile shows people that you're happy. In that way, my family is extremely beneficial to each other. Everyday when we're having a conversation, someone will bring up a story, or movie quote that they were reminded of and say it out loud to everybody with just the right accent so that it sounds exactly like the movie, and cause everyone to laugh. For example, every now and again, my brother or sister will bring up a quote from PERSON1 or PERSON2, two comedians we really enjoy listening to, and every person in the room would pitch in with hilarious quotes they said and this could go on all night. Or, a little while ago, my favorite movie wasGet CAPS1 because it was quite entertaining, so we would have rampages over supper or just randomly in the kitchen quoting that one movie for at least half an hour and the room would be filled with non-stop laughter. On the other hand, someone will make a random comment because they heard wrong, or just don't understand. Like when we were having a dinner party at my house. My family and our guests were sitting at the table just finished eating when we got onto the topic of CAPS2 CAPS3 because my little sister was learning about them in school. We verbally completed the train of ""Which CAPS4 ruled CAPS5, who they came from, and CAPS5 they're other names were"". But according to my little sister, we missed one. So, out of the blue comes ""CAPS5 about CAPS6?!"". Her intentions were about the CAPS4, but I believe everyone in the room heard ""CAPS5 about CAPS9 CAPS10?!"", until we paused for a second and processed CAPS5 she meant, and we all laughed and she had no idea why until she stopped to think about it herself. Our family has good times filled with laughter and jokes, but there are also a few very depressing times. About four years ago, an incident happened with my next door neighbor that caused him to be brutally attacked and pass away on our door step. He was very dear to my family and the rest of the cul-de-sac we live in, and for him to die like that was extremely unexpected and terrible to wake up to in the middle of night. After that, there was a period of not very much laughter and fun because we were all haunted by this horror. But, we all knew that his spirit was there to protect us, and so whenever we thought of that, there was a gap between the mourning of his loss, only to be filled in with happiness and laughter. I believe that my family and I have a really tight connection between each other, because we're so funny. There's never any stress between us, but always a calm sense of familiarity and bonding. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I believe that, whoever that person is, is right. Even between two strangers that run into each other on the street, if they stop and have a conversation, and one person cracks a joke causing them both to laugh, it's the spark to an immediate connection, and they could become friends for a long time. This is one of the most important values that people have, and most people overlook how much it really matters to humanity.",0
"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author writes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mas was nature itself."" (Lüsted, paragraph NUM1) It was reported that the winds on top of the building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. A dirigible on the building would not be able to land properly or be weighted down with lead weights like those in open landing fields. It would not be practical to dangle weight over the heads of hundreds of people walking in the streets below. In addition to nature itself, safety was another great obstacle that the builders were faced with. It is written that, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted, paragraph NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, an accident could be extreme in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building was located. An accident had already occurred with a German dirigible by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. When all is said and done, nature and safety were two obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An example would be from the excerpt when the author writes in paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area."" This quote means the builders were faced with the challenge of space to land the dirigibles because New York City was a relatively crowded area. Another example would be in paragraph NUM1, when the author tells about the safety hazards. Many dirigibles used hydrogen insted of helium, which is extremely flammable. A last example would be in paragraph NUM2 when the author describes the safety hazards. The builders had to consider the violent winds on the top of the building. Many obstacles came upon the builders.",0
"I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",0
"Censorship for the future kids of america.    Personally i have read some disturbing books also watched some grotesque and twisted, disturbing rated CAPS1 movies. Not even talking about all the messed up music ive heard so far in my lifetime.    What it comes down to is alot of the music today is about sex, drugs, money, and violent crimes and gangs. The movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids. Books any one can get from a public library and some are about murder, rape, gang, violence, and all the horrable reality of the devilsh deeds in the world.    I personally dont have a kid but if i had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated CAPS1 movie i would wanna file a complaint because thats not how i want my kid growing up. With a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth. Also i would'nt want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out his mouth.    But the ORGANIZATION1 needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until there old enough to go get it on there own like they need to be NUM1 to go see a rated CAPS1 movie. That is how it should have always been.",0
"I've heard reports from both the news on CAPS2.V. and your paper that more and more people are turned in to nothing but their computers. I'm not saying it's a bad thing I mean the computer has the internet which allows you to go to anything like websites and online chatting. I just think that people should get outside more often and do some outdoor things like football, basketball, baseball or if you're an adult you could get a job that doesn'CAPS2 require a computer like for example building houses for homless people, shelters for animals, or have a job as a maitnence man, pool lifeguard, or any other job at a hotel that doesn'CAPS2 involve a computer. You could work at a restaurant that has regular food or fast food service. Something that does'ent involve a computer. But if you can'CAPS2 get out of the house you could do something a little different from computers video games. They maybe similar to the computer but they are something you can do on the CAPS2.v. and it beats playing on the computer all the time.",0
"During the construction of the mooring mast a top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced some obstacles. One obstacle that they faced was that they couldn't just ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" CAPS1, they had to do some work on the building, so it could support it. As the CAPS2 said, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation"". Another obstacle the builders faced was that if there was an accident, like the Hindenburg, it would be much more dangerous, because there would be many more people nearby, who could get hurt by the fire. ""The greatest obstacle of the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" said the CAPS2. The wind currents above the building shifted due to ""violent air currents."" Also, dirigibles need to have weights attached at the back of them, but at the Empire State Building, these weights would be dangling high above pedestrians... neither practicle nor safe"". The other obstacle was that blimps couldn't get close enough to the mast, due to the wind, like the Los angeles. Due to all of these obstacles, the mooring mast hasn't been used since.",0
"The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the empire state Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure its stable at the same time. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land. Eventually it was safe enough for the dirigibles to land and the people could get off and take a tour of the top part of the building.",0

"Everyone in life has siblings that they grew up with and that they love unconditionally, but for some of us, we didn't know our siblings until later in life. I myself was one of those people but with a slight difference than some others. I had what I like to call a PERSON1 who in actuality in my biological father. Up until I was seven years old I thought that my dad PERSON2 was my quote on quote ""real dad"", but one evening I heard my mother down stairs yelling at someone on the phone. My mom was yelling at this unknown figure about child support and signing over his rights to my dad. I had no idea that who she was talking about was me and in fact the one on the other DATE1 of the line was my biological father. The moment I heard your son deserves better than this I ran upstairs to my room and began to weep because I thought that PERSON2 was my dad but now this new figure in my life is claiming to be. My mom had heard me run up the stairs and came to tell me the story of what was really going on. As it had turned out my biological father had rights to my last name and unless he signed these over to my dad, my mom would take him to court and force him to pay the thousands he owed her for child's support. During this little story that she was unveiling I had learned that I have other siblings out there in the world. Over the next eight years of my life I would spend countless hours running through old phone numbers and email address's trying to find my other siblings. It wasn't up until my freshman year that I met a guy who went to my school and was in the same grade as me, named PERSON3. He quickly became one of my good friends and we hung out every other DATE1. On one occasion that he was at my house playing video games with me, he chanced upon a question of what my last name was. I thought to myself that this was a peculiar question but in the DATE1 I told him. All of the sudden a smile crept across his face and he asked if I had a biological father named CAPS1. My mind started to reel over this sudden question. PERSON3 started to explain to me that he was half brother to my sister CAPS2 who was one of the siblings that I had been searching for. Almost before I CAPS3 think to ask the question of how; he had called my sister and explained to her he had found her brother. As it had turned out, she had been looking for me just as hard as I was looking for her. PERSON3 asked her if she would like to meet me and I heard a high pitched squeal of joy from my sister saying yes on the phone. I to was overjoyed at the thought but I had no idea of how awkward it would be to finally meet her the next DATE1. On the DATE1 that I met my sister, CAPS4 mom had come to pick me up to take me to her house. As we were driving so many thought were racing through my head that I thought I would puke in the car. When we finally arrived at her house PERSON4 who is CAPS4 mom, urged me out of the car and into the house where my sister that I realized looked almost the same as me was sitting on the couch looking just as nervous as I was. During the next four long nerve racking hours, my sister and I played NUM1 questions with each other to get to know one another. After doing this we were more comfortable with each other and she looked a lot more accepting that I was truly her older brother. By the DATE1 we were telling jokes and laughing hysterically. We realized that we even had the same obnoxious laugh (that every one hated) and that to made us hit the floor laughing. At one point in time her mom had to tell us to quiet down because we were going to wake the baby if we didn't and by the DATE1 of the DATE1 we had connected with each other so much that she even gave me a hug before I left. CAPS2 and I connected most through our laughter the first time we met and from that DATE1 to even now; every time we see each other we giggle and smirk. Since we found each other or in my case her brother found me; I have gone to her house every other weekend. My sister is one of the most precious people I have in my life and that will never change because nothing we say or do will ever stop the laughing and joy we hold towards one another.",0
"In 'Rough CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclists surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in the high deserts of California in June, the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster.

"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, their were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was the safety. Paragraph NUM1 from the excerpts explains that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It shows us that if an accident was to happen on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown New York, then the accident could get ugly. Another reason why was nature itself. Paragraph NUM2 explains that the, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was another safety issue because the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As you can see those were some obstacles builders faced.",0

Here is my reason why the story, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen."" CAPS2, his gratefulness. CAPS1 is very grateful for how things turned out. Here another reason why from the story. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" CAPS3, his view on things. CAPS1 had very fortunate times in his eyes. Ultamately these were my reasons for the mood that was created by the author parenthesis, gratefulness, and his perspective.",0
"Debates are a main part of our society today. Everyone has an opinion on how things should be in the world, and no one is necessarily right. Books that show how other cultures behave, that to the people being described in the book MONTH1 seem offensive, are important because we as people need to absorb as much as we can about other cultures. Our businesses are in other countries, many people living in LOCATION1 speak multiple languages, and people have the right to read things that MONTH1 in fact be offensive to a race of people.       Businesses thrive in other countries. A lot of our countries income is from our factories and companies in other countries. LOCATION2 is a place where much business happens for the ORGANIZATION2. If we, as CAPS1, can't learn about the CAPS2, how can we learn their business methods and way of life? To the CAPS2, these books MONTH1 be offensive, but to us they are learning tools descirbing CAPS2 culture.     Being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to. High schools require that we learn some foreign language, even if it is only the basics. The schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the work force. Learning about their language and habits comes from books. The mexican population might not like the way we depict them in our stories, but this is necessary to learn about them.     In the ORGANIZATION1, there are all kinds of freedoms that we as CAPS1 use freely. Freedom of speech says that we can say whatever we want when we live in LOCATION1. Books are not excluded from this rule. I'm sure that other countries have offensive books about us. It's a common theme around the globe.      Businesses thrive in foreign countries, so we must be able to read some books about them, even if they seem offensive. Learning new things is something that every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn. If a book has vulgar language and sexual scenes, it should be taken out of the children's section of the library, not banned completely. This is the same case with other populations of people. They cannot take offense to what we have to say, because worse has been said about them than what we can possibly put in a book. Learning is a necessary tool in our society and nothing should be restricted.",0
"Laughter is one of the most impotent things in life to have around. even if from a simple joke to something that was unbelievable that hap-end to make a grate event in time to share on in history of family members. This helps you threw hard times or just makes somebody day better for them and puts a smile on there face, or gives them a joke to say to somebody else to continue a chain of laughter thew people. Sometimes it can be the most embarrassing thing that people remember about u but in the end the other person that laughs at you for your indecent probably did something like that a long time a go so in the end there laughing at them selves to and don't even realize it. I remember on my fifteenth birthday my grandma toke the hole family out to dinner at a chines restaurant. It was quiet except for the adults discussing what they should order form the family meals. I was siting by me sister looking at a menu just to see what they had to drink, well her mined was on other things because out of no were all u heard was ""they have no fricken chicken"". Every one busted up laughing at her even the waitresses son that was standing behind the both and his mother. It made every ones day because it wasn't the best of days at the time. But u could tell she was embarrassed but laughed at her self to her comment to the table was ""i thought i said it in my head"", i looked at here and said ""no u didn't"" so she just shrugged about it.  To this day when ever we go to a chines restaurant my mom looks at here and ""says they got your fricken chicken""so she looks at here and ""says will that ever die""we all looked at here and said"" no its going to be passed down to your children they'll here about there mothers fricken chicken day"".It was that bad of a indecent that she gets up set that it wont go away but it still gives every one else a laugh. even though it was so long ago that it happened are parents joke that its going to be her wedding toast it went kinda like this"" as long as you give her, her fricken chicken you CAPS1 will last forever"" it was not the nicest of comments to be said about that day but it was still funny to the rest of us. this is something that will last in the family for years to come ,and hopefully will be passed down in the generations to come.Even if she doesn't want it to be just think in time ens-ted of us telling every one about the incident she will tell them her self and just laugh about it because it was just that much of an out off nowhere thing to happen. We still pick on her about it and many other things she says out loud with out noticing she says them. But those are story's for another time and day you never know what could happen. just remember to laugh its true what they say its healthy for you so make the best of some of the worst days possible.  So if your having a not so good of a day,u never know what could happen to give u a smile and a laugh even if your the one that makes every one laugh. So just think of something that makes u laugh and tell the people that are special in your life about it to give them a laugh and make there day a little better then most.Even if its one of the most embarrassing events to happen to you in your life time. When we all were little and crying that was always the cure for some of the worst things even though u grow up it docent mean u cant laugh or that it means different things then it used to, when your down u need to laugh to feel better about your self don't let people put you down.",0
"I think that certain things in libraries should be taken off shelves if found offensive but not all. One of these things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs. Another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments. Having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library. Another thing that could be, but not entirely, removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts. This type of material should only be given to an older audience.     I think that anything that contains slander or judgement on another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves. As time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious. With that being said I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in being made fun of or rejected. It MONTH1 not seem like harmful material at first glance, but your opinion MONTH1 change when your customers come back angry and frustrated about what they read and saw. It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with complaints and costant arguments.     Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material. Racism has been one the worlds largest problems, it affects us all no matter who it's against. Picture a book in your library that calls all black teens a problem or a book that says all arabians dangerous, racist isn't it? Now imagine if your customers were of one of those two ethnicities, it's not a good picture at all. Keeping these stereotypes and harmful sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will keep all customers happy. The last thing we want is for a customer to say 'those people are racist!'.     Lastly I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors. Kids always follow what they hear or what they see. Since they're still in that stage where they rarely do things in their own way they MONTH1 mimic or copy things they see. Another problem that surrounds this is peer pressure which will get more and more children commiting these acts. If this is to happen many parents will become outraged and blame the libraries for relaeasing this material to children. So the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors, if it is contained within your library",0

"The mood the author created in the memoir is united, caring, loving and more. The authour is combining all of those moods together and memories to write this memoir, which is what a memoir is about; yourself, memories, family and etc. A reason why the author created does moods because a home is were a family live's together and were they hold memories together which shows loving. For example in the memoir, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Which is obviously the mood of loving, because there all a loving family together. A second reason why the author created does mood because in the place were the author lived there were many different people from different places. Even though they all werent the same the acted as a family and were united. For example, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united. A third reason why the author created does moods because the author's parent's werent just caring for themselves but for others also just like their children. For example, ""They come selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life."" Which means her parent werent just caring abalt them but the future for there son. The whole story is based on home and family but the thing is that a home and family will always share the love, caring and unity of one another.",0

"I've heard that not many people think computers benefit society. I disagree with that. Computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about foregin places, and allow people to communicate with others online. Some people were basically born with hand-eye coordination, but most people weren't, like me, for example. But, thanks to computers, my hand-eye coordination has gone up! ""On average, computers can increase a persons hand-eye coordination by up to PERCENT1 says PERSON2. Think of it, just by learning to tye, your hand-eye coordination can go up PERCENT1.! That's amazing! Having good hand-eye coordination will get you far in life, and helps with small, everyday things such as playing an instrument, or doing household chores. It also helps in sports. You need good hand-eye coordination to throw, catch, and aim. If more people spend more time on the computer, then the population's hand-eye coordination would increase, and who wouldn't want thats. Have you ever heard of LOCATION1? It is a country in LOCATION2 that no one really knows much about. By looking it up on the computer, you can become an expert on the country! The computer gives us access to a lot of knowledge, and will make us more of people around the world. This can improve our travel. Instead of going to the same place every vacation, you can go to a place you saw online that looks just as exciting. Also, by learning about other countries and the people in them, we gain respect for them. We MONTH1 also learn about their traditions, and culture. ""The internet gives us access to the world,"" says PERSON1, ""we can learn so many new things that will make us more of people, countries, and the environment."" CAPS1 is right, we can also be aware of the environment. Since global warming is a problem, we can learn how o preserve foreign places by learning about them on the internet. With a click of a mouse you can virtually have the whose world at your fingertips! In a recent study PERCENT2 of people said they don't have time to meet with old friends. The internet, however has made it quick and easy to talk to people online. Websites like CAPS2, CAPS3, and CAPS4 can keep your social life in tact, and can even reunite yu with old friends. For example, CAPS2 suggest family. You can keep in touch wih many people trough CAPS2! Also, you can make new friends. Most teens say they are always willing to meet new people, and the internet is a great way to do so! Sites like CAPS7, and CAPS8 can can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person, just to talk. I once talked with someone on CAPS7 for over an hour! We found that we both have CAPS4 accounts and keep in touch there! This also helps you gain confidence because you MONTH1 have the courage to say something over the computer that you would't say real life. The computer can really amp up your social life.

"Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.             It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.       Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about MONEY1 to fix.            Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.             Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way.",0

There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. Thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.,0
"The mood of the author is happy. The mood is happy because they doesn't really mention any negative thoughts or feelings at all. He mentions throughout the story, how he is so grateful for his family, like his mom and dad. He talks about himself being cuban, and how proud he is to be Cuban. The narrator has a bunch of good thoughts, about his mother and father. He mentioned in the story ""I will alway be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. He always tells his parents of how proud he is of them, and mentions how their basically an CAPS1.",0
"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, The builders had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Though this idea was not successful, it took them a long time to realize the causes and effects of docking dirigibles. over sixty thousand dallors were spent on modifications for the building. after fixing the structure of the building the builders found out the weather had interfered. Because of the high winds the dirigibles were constantly shift. There wasn't a safe way to control shifting. Their was also a law against airships flying too low over populated cities. another reason was, dirigibles were very dangerous and highly flammable. Trying to build a mooring mast was not a good idea.",0
"Some materials in libraries MONTH1 have information that is offensive towards others.  But should they be removed if they are found offensive? Some people believe that they should be removed depending on how bad the offense is. But materials MONTH1 be removed if it is sexual, racist, or life threatening offense.     Some material MONTH1 have offensive comments that is sexual. If its an offense that is sensored and the author or artist of the material went too far, then that MONTH1 be a good reason for the material to be removed.  It MONTH1 make the person feel emotions that bring them down.  It MONTH1 also make the person feel violated and offended.     There MONTH1 be material that has racist comments.  Racism is one of the biggest conflicts in the world today.  It is something that starts fights and arguements.  It also causes individuals to feel bad about themselves.  Racism can cause people to feel very hurt also. So if there is too much racism in a material, then that should be removed.     There are some material that MONTH1 have offense that seems life threatening.  Say that it is a book about the whole nation and the author slips in something that MONTH1 seem like the nation would be in danger, someone MONTH1 feel offended and want that material removed.  Material with too much threat in it MONTH1 make one feel like their life is in danger or like something bad is going to happen.  They would feel a life threatening offense and want it to be removed from the shelves.     So should offensive materials be removed from the shelves? Yes they should.  If they were to be found sexually, life threatening offense or had racist comments, they should be removed so individuals won't feel these offenses are life threatening, hurtful, or cause negative emotions",0
"Laughter's CAPS1 Laughter is everywhere. It MONTH1 be three doors down reclining in a comfy living room. It MONTH1 be at the nearest playground bouncing on the teeter-totter. It MONTH1 be at an elegant restaurant sitting at a petite table in the distant corner. For me, it lingered in an old fifth grade classroom. I stumbled through the doorway carrying CAPS11 purple backpack and CAPS11 lunch pale resting in CAPS11 left hand. I recognized everyone from CAPS11 previous years of elementary school, and shortly joined them after visiting CAPS11 hook outside the door. I had been waiting anxiously for CAPS11 turn at the fifth grade. The legendary PERSON1, was known as the ""coolest"" teacher around. He played a large role in the gossip of the young students, and each of us had our hopes set high. ""CAPS2 your seats NUM1 graders!"" announced PERSON1 CAPS3 with a contagious smile. Kids scattered around to room searching for seats near their closest friends. Everyone listened attentively to PERSON1's introduction to the year. His voice caught our full attention, but not too exciting compared to our expectations. He appeared very nice as most teachers come, but still nothing spectacular. The day dragged on. The sleepy faces returned and the vivid colors had escaped our touch. The day finally reached an end, not satisfying the eager children. The next day rose quickly and I trudged back to the disappointing classroom. To CAPS11 surprise, the next day was nothing like the first. The classroom CAPS7 experienced a drastic change. Every wall was filled with endless color. Posters layered over the plain paint with fascinating pictures and words. A fancy popcorn machine rested in the back of the room. Fresh popcorn overflowed from inside. The smell traveled through our needy nostrils as we entered. Mr. CAPS3 sat contently at his broad desk as we made our way to our seats once again. He welcomed us to our second day. After the first couple minutes of class I had found that the rumors were true. He had a sense of simple humor that created giggles in every corner of the class. His ideas and word choice related to us as NUM1 graders. We found his subtle jokes quite amusing to our young minds. He spoke like we spoke, he acted like we acted, and he joked like we joked. He even created customized nicknames for each of us. Laughter hung over our heads like a heavy CAPS1, never continuing along. Weekly popcorn servers would hand out stuffed bags to all the kids as the class read aloud. Kids became ecstatic on jeopardy CAPS4 gathering teams as quick as possible. His classroom became a place that we wanted to stay forever, never parting from hour long games and water chugging contests. Despite the everlasting fun and games, PERSON1 showed us what it was really like to be a learner. He cared about our future and pushed us to strive in every moment of life. He taught us to write with desire and worth. To express our feelings on paper and tell the world a story that we want heard. He would plan one on one time with students struggling in a particular subject, and next class their confidence had bloomed. He had an ability to reach into our minds, find out who we were, and emerge that hidden confidence to become CAPS9. We respected him, yet felt comfortable messing around with him during class as he had frequently done to us. PERSON1 gave us a craving to learn.  DATE1 TIME1, I had began to walk home, when PERSON1 CAPS3 stopped me at the door.  ""CAPS6 PERSON2C!"" I unexpectedly said in a high tone, not hiding CAPS11 enthusiasm. He chuckled, ""CAPS7 fun at class today?"" ""CAPS8 yeah,"" I answered with a grin. ""I'm glad"" he continued, then changing the subject, ""I was thinking about having a huge dodge ball tournament at recess tomorrow. Do CAPS10 think that would be a good idea?"" I snickered to myself, trying to comprehend the fact that an adult had said this to me, ""That would be so fun."" ""CAPS9,"" he expressed quite excited, ""CAPS10 are a really neat kid, CAPS10 know that? Its a lot of fun having CAPS10 in class."" CAPS11 face lit up. I stood there smiling for quite some time. We finished our slight conversation and I continued home. Every student in the class yearned to be liked by PERSON1, as if he were the most popular kid at school. I was liked by PERSON2 I was liked by the man that changed CAPS11 whole outlook on education and life. Gradually, from time to time, I drift back to the careless days of NUM1 grade and PERSON2 I still laugh at the ridiculous events that occurred in that small classroom each and every day. Frequently, I glance above me to witness that dense CAPS1 that still hovers above me. Laughter has left a mark on me, and those kids of CAPS11 NUM1 grade class.",0

"I think that CAPS4 is fine if you take them out. Your should be NUM1 or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad. If they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated CAPS1.     I have read some books that are really good,but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book CAPS3 'A CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4' and CAPS4 is really sad.CAPS4's about this CAPS2 and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little. I liked the book but CAPS4 was sad,but I read CAPS4 because people were talking about CAPS4.     Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the t.v. because they think that they are bad. I was watching this t.v. show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch CAPS4 but I do. I'm NUM1 years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch. I don't think she likes CAPS4 because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell.     Some movies are better if they have bad things in them, CAPS4 makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes. I would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie.

"The features of the setting made the cyclists journey even longer and more strenuous. The reason it being in such a remote area did not help. For example the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist grandparents and the directions were horrible. Also, the fact that their were no new shops or areas or rest for the cyclist to go to; the water pump he found was old and nasty and the only building he saw was abandoned. Also ther factor was the rough terrain. It  being froit the cyclist was already very fatigued by lack of water and tiredness the terrain was long, bumpy and just horrible all together. Finally, the last factor was where he was bicycling in California on a CAPS1 summer day and he being on a which had no n.c(but which bike does) did not help at all. These are how the features affect the cyclist journey.",0
"There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there One problem is that if they were to tie a single cable tether to the building & the blimp then it would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the blimps load, and wind pressure had to have been sent all the way to the base of the building which was DATE1 ft. below. Another problem that aroused later was that other blimps outside the United States were made whydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flamable. Now since the German blimp, the Hindenburg, blew up by fire over CAPS1, New Jersey, architectes are now worried that it will be a bad idea to do this bc if it happened over LOCATION3 city then many more lives would be in danger. Also yet another obstacle came up due to nature itself. The winds  the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent wind currents. Even if the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the rear end of the blimp would be all over the place. Thats why now, blimps dock on the ground and are held down by weights on NUM1 sides. One other reason that this is a problem is that docking a blimp  the Empire State Building would be illegal due to the case that it is flying to low to the ground. This law also makes it illegal for the blimp to dock on to the building.",0
"My grandma is almost always patient with me, especially when she is teaching how to do something like cook or sew. One time my grandma taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me how to chang the color of the thread, and she helped me untangle the thread, even though it took a while and Im not the best listener, that took a lot of patience. Another time she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would get very invoked because either the cookie broke or my frosting was lumpy and all over the cookie even the bottom, but grandma put up with my complaining and when I finally frosted on that didnt break and the frosting was smooth, she praised me, even though I had probably broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make carmol corn, which has many difficult steps, and if you one wrong, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easy stuff mostly, bat she also let me make the sauce on the last batch which was fun, and when I started to go to slow, instead of yealing at me to harry up, she asked me politely to go a little quicker which must of taken a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which took a CAPS1 amount of patience because I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda, anything in the recipe that could be dropped I dropped it, I also never wanted to stay clean it up and when I did, I still left half the stuff on the floor.

"CAPS2 you know that eight out of ten homes in LOCATION1 have at least one computer if not more? Computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. They benefit our society in many ways. Without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily. Maybe the best benifit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless posibilities to how they can benifit our society. Many people don't realize that some families can not be with eachother so easily as other. If a family member is in the service somtimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to commnunicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benifit is a lie. For others who don't have such sevier need of communicating it is still a convinient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. Also many times this can be an altenative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is defanitly a benifit to communiting. The computer can also make many tasks much esier, for example if you were assiangned a NUM1 pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also many buisnesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program excel, ORGANIZATION2 created this to make a simple way to organize data. It is much more efficient than than having every thing in different site with millions of texters in every draw. So another benifit of the computer is that it can keep tthings organized and poride easy ways to complete evey day tasks. Maybe the greatest benifit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. Say I was curiouse about the recent earthquake in LOCATION2, if I wanted more inofrmartion CAPS3 head straight to the computer. You simply go to ORGANIZATION3 or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and bam you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. The computer is full of information, and is right at our finger tips, this is definitly a huge benifit to our socierty. The computer is a wonderful tool that can asist in so many ways, wether it is communication organization, or just curiosity. This advance in technology is just another way to improve every day life. Computers don't just benifit our little town of LOCATION1, they benifit our whole socoety in all of the amazing things they do.",0
"In the essay Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. The setting and the features affected him not only physically, but mentally as well. The setting caused him to doubt himself and the men and also it kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going. Where the cyclist was riding, in California, affected him physically. It was hot, and he had no watter. This caused him to become tired and frustrated. The setting affected him emotionally as well. He started off fine, but as he went on, and as the road slowly changed to hills, he began to get frustrated and angred that he listened to the men. As he saw no buildings in sight for many miles, he began to lose his determination as well as hope. Lastly, when he saw the sign Gary and CAPS1 Fish Camp he started to regain hope and become less frustrated.

"There are a couple things that can lead strangers to being comfortable with each other, in my experience it was laughter. Meeting my boyfriends parents was very nerve wrecking and uncomfortable. I am a people person and I can get along with anybody. Starting a conversation with someone who is judging my every move was a little bit of a challenge.  My boyfriend PERSON3 and I have been dating for almost a year now and are the type of people that like spending time with our families. So because of this it was obvious that meeting the family would come into play. I met his parents when we were young and we attended the last years of elementary and some of middle school and all but one year of high school together, I left for a couple years and came back really different. So after NUM1 months of dating I met the folks.  One day in DATE1 PERSON3 had a football game that i attended with some girlfriends who were also dating guys on the team. After a terrible loss PERSON3 came out of the locker room and hugged me and told me it was time to meet the parents. I took a deep breath and started to get really nervous. I love meeting new people and I usually don't have a problem with it, but the fact that I wanted his parents to love me put a lot of weight on me.  I slowly walked over after him, and said ""CAPS3"" in my most friendly voice possible. His mother reached out and said "" CAPS1 PERSON1, I'm CAPS2"" I took her hand and shook it and replied ""CAPS3, so nice to meet you"". I looked at ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance then his father reached out with a very welcoming smile and his eyes looked so familiar and warm. "" CAPS4 there, I'm PERSON2"", I shook his hand and felt less nervous and a bit comfortable. "" CAPS1 , great to meet you, what did you think of the game?'. He looked surprise that i talked and we started a great conversation about football.  After talking about football for about NUM2 or NUM3 minutes PERSON3 brought up something that reminded me of a joke. I always have lame jokes so I was nervous about telling it to his parents. It wasn't even a funny joke, PERSON3 thought it was lame, yet i loved it. I took the chance anyways. I said "" CAPS4 that reminds me of a joke"", PERSON3 looked at me with wide eyes that said oh god, don't. I looked away and started ""so there were two muffins in the oven one said, wow its hot in here, there the other screamed, holy crap! A talking muffin. I started laughing and my laugh is very odd. Anyone i meet tells me me laugh is so unique. His mother was like ""that is adorable i will have to tell it to CAPS6"", I smiled gratefully. His father PERSON2 said so sweetly "" I like your laugh, i ain't heard anything like it"". PERSON3 came in and said ""yes her laugh is really something"". We all kinda smiled and at each other and went to dinner, cracking jokes and laughing then laughing at my laugh. Thank goodness for laughing, once we started laughing I felt comfortable and welcomed. Until this day we laugh at me telling that joke. I still until this day am happy i told the joke.",0

"The builders and engineers involved in allowing The Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast around one thousand two hundred and fifty feet in the air faced many obstacles. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by ORGANIZATION2, taken from The Empire State Building, the reader is taken through the journey in allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to refuel and transport passengers atop the Empire State Building. This was not an easy task; in fact it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be on top of the building, and its height and weight and wind pressure on the building was dangerous. In paragraph nine it is stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major obstacles. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium-which is highly Flammable. A fire or explosion in the location that the mooring mast was to be located would be devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached ed unless legislation was changed. All of these obstacles made it very hard to dock dirigibles on top of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, However to blimps did attempt to land there. The U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear Blimp ""Columbia"" both were unsuccessful in landing due to intense winds and sharp spires of nearby buildings. This project is an example of a beneficial idea which was nearly impossible to execute.",0

"Laughter has been a nonchalant but steady and strong force for me in many relationships. I believe that laughter is useful in getting to know people you've just met and growing closer to people you care about. In my opinion CAPS2 brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down. Getting enough bravery to gain new friends, ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her, is where laughter played an important role. CAPS2 was the DATE1 I was fifteen and a sophomore at ORGANIZATION1 school. CAPS2 was my first year there. I have been to many schools, LOCATION1, CAPS1 wood, etc. and like any new school I was having a hard time connecting on a social level with my peers. Everyday I woke up, got ready, went to school, got home did homework (maybe), and went to bed . CAPS2 was a boring cycle that I seemed to be trapped in. The image of being cool and trying to fit in did not seem to work so much. Because one thing I realized was that trying to be cool and something you're not only gets you so far. The one thing that kids, people in general, like is when you're real and being yourself . I found that out later on, but I actually didn't realize that's what people liked the most. I said to myself one time that I didn't like trying to act like someone or something because the truth was I actually thought that I was a cool person deep down. So I changed my ways I stopped trying to act cool, and acted like myself. And CAPS2 turned out that I actually was cool and that girls actually found me attractive, and not only attractive but a funny person that was likable. My main attribute, well besides my looks was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. CAPS2 gained me many friends that I didn't have in the beginning. CAPS2 even gained me one of the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Her name was LOCATION2, in my eyes there was no girl that could compare to her in any way. She had the body of a coca cola bottle, caramel skin, and the face of a goddess ( and I'm not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl she had many followers and admirers who were similar to me. So what chance did I have? What did I, PERSON1 have to offer her? Laughter. My greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many of times. Even though CAPS2 didn't last as long as I would have liked CAPS2( forever) CAPS2 was great being with her for as long as I did, the things we got to do and the many experiences we had together, are priceless. And CAPS2 was all because of my ability to make her laugh and to put a smile on her face. I believe that without laughter this world would not be the place that CAPS2 is today. Sure, there is still crime and many horrors and atrocity's committed today, but imagine how horrid CAPS2 would be without laughter. Joy, which I believe is the core of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. CAPS2 allows us to turn our heads and overlook things. Without us being able to laugh how could we expect to survive the future",0

"This leter I am writing to you is about how computers affect people. I am concerned about computers use in our society because people that spend too much time on the computer spend less time outdoors, exercising, and with family and friends. Let me tell you modre about it... As stated in the paragraph above, one reason I am concerned about computer use is that less time is spent outdoors.""Everyone, young or old, should get outside for some fresh air for at least NUM1 minutes everyday,"" PERSON2. Using the computer could limit this time, and that probably isn'CAPS1 healthy being in the house all day. A second reason CAPS1 worry shout over- usage of computers relates to the first reason. Too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday. ""People should exercise an hour a day to stay healthy,"" ssays health expert PERSON1,"" however PERCENT1 of people don'CAPS1 because of computers."" this happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels. You plan to play for NUM2 minutes, but the NUM2 minutes turns into NUM4 minutes, which MONTH1 even turn into an hour! I know still MONTH1 be hard to understand why I'm concerned about using computers, CAPS2 I have one more reason. My final reason in this letter of why I don'CAPS1 like over using computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends. How of you can see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam. But it's not the same as spending quality time. ""Friends come and go and you and your family won'CAPS1 live forever,"" says therapist PERSON3"", CAPS2 motor the best of that you have."" there won'CAPS1 be many if you eyes are glued to the computer screen. As you can see there reasons why I am concerned about people spending time on the computer. There's less time to exercise enjoy nature and interact with family and friends. I hope you take this into concideration.",0
"The Empire State Building was in construction the building passed for many obstacles. First, because they wanted to do the biggest build in the world and they had to work hard. The State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reason that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed",0
"Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are three big things in my school, and community. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are all about those three things. If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school? I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict.     We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library. Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries. If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed. I'm a big believer on the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter CAPS1 precautions are taken. But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too yound to see them, like under the age of NUM1. It is not just movies that we have to worry about though.     ORGANIZATION1 is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occassional 'CAPS1 to wear this DATE1!' articles. I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests. Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects. Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast. I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem. If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea. If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it. ORGANIZATION1, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible. Music is a world-wide phenomenon.     Say a child around the age of NUM2 is listening to the new CAPS2' PERSON1 song. He is being introduces to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the NUM3 minute time period it takes to listen to the full song. Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there. This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries. We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending NUM4 of our childhoodteenage years here, why let us listen to it? If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer. After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate. Music does not fall into that category. It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated.     I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music. They are my three m's and I live by them. But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconciously) do participate in a criminal act. I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me. If they are not pleased with CAPS1 it is, I will not do it behind their back. The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict. If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up to fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts. The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed.",0
"Did you know that four out of five households have a computer? But why so many? It's because computers have a positive effect on people, Have you ever thought why? With computers you can contact people in different parts of the CAPS1. You can search up different information over the internet. Computers also benifit other electronic inventions. What do LOCATION5, LOCATION2, LOCATION6 and LOCATION7 all have in common? you can contact the people there with computers! while talking to people around the CAPS1, you can learn something about a culture or lifestyle that you didn't know before. You just might make a new friend along the way. Picture if you will, a hard working business man who lives in the LOCATION1. He works for a CAPS1 - famous company and has to go to a meeting with the big boss is LOCATION4. Wouldn't it just be easier to set up a video chat? That way, there's no hassle with a plane voyage and it's much easier. Why do you think it's called the CAPS1-CAPS2 CAPS3? Over the internet, you can search up unlimited amounts of information. Animals, sports, a report to do on LOCATION3, where do you go to find easy-to-read information instantly? Search him up on ORGANIZATION1 or ORGANIZATION2. You never what might find out. There are new additions daily. With no computers, how would you download music to an NUM1? You can't, you have to use a computer. Computers benifit a lot of other electronic equipment. You can download videos, print out photographs and charge CAPS4 and other electronics. Technology these days is empressive. It gave birth to the much-used computer. Computers have a large positive effect on our lifestyle. Contact with otehrs around the CAPS1 is now easier than ever. Information can be found instantly. And with computers, other electronics can work as well.",0

This made him happy because he knew that he was safe and loved with these people. When his community of differences came together to form one community, this made Narciso happy. The mood is both grateful and happy. I would also be grateful for this, happiness is key to having friendships and famalies.",0
"As a teenager I am trying to grow and find my way in life and find ways to express myself. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines ect.. should be censored in libraries. Everyone has their own opinion on things such as the music we listen to or the books we read. I do believe that younger children like middle schoolerspreschoolers should be censored from violent songs and movies, but for highschoolers and older I think that it should be our choice. I think that if the libraries really believe that a book or magazine is truely offensice they shouldn't allow them to be published. Not everyone is going to like every book or every type of music that is out there. We should be able to get the books that we like from libraries. Like Katherine Paterson said ' And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries are able to remove books music ect.. because they believe they are offensive there would be no books left for us to read or songs for us to listen to.I believe that highschoolers and older should be able do decide for themselves what kind of books they read or music they listen to. If you dont like a certain type of music dont listen to it, if you dont like the way a book is written, dont read it. No one is making you to read or listen to something that you dont want to. Books that MONTH1 be offensive to some MONTH1 be eye oppening to another. In books we learn about war and things that I fing gruesome and unnessisary, but sometimes it is a fact of life and the things we might find offensive in books are usually things that are happening in real life.I do believe that younger children should be censored form books and music that might be offensive, because they are not big enought to know what is right or wrong, and they dont know what to do with violent information in books about war and music with cussing. In conclusion, I believe that libraries should only censor books that are found offensice to parents with younger children and in younger sections of libraries.",0
"There are different types of books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders in libraries. Books can be fiction or nonfiction. However, books or any other items can be offensive to people but to others it is just a book to read. So therefore, libraries should not remove books or any other items from the shelf.      Who picks out the books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders? The answer is the customers at the library. The authors of the books or items did not. The authors gave the decision to choice between books or items. No one can blame the authors. Also, there are different kinds and different types of writtters or artists. Writters and artists took their time for completing a novel or series for us to read or hear. People should not take it seriously about books or other source because it can be nonfiction are fiction.      My next example why libraries should not remove items off the shelf is it might offensed someone but not to others. For example slavery can offensed a colored person but to others it is just a historical event. People need to know what happened in the past with historical events. People need to read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not. Therefore, people should not try to remove it.                    If a child checks out a book and their parents let them, it is the parents fault. It is there fault because parents let their child check the items out. Also, if a person has a problem with books or any other sources then complain but the libraries should not remove it from the shelf. Like I said before, one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it.           Libraries are for people to check out books or other sources, and not to remove books or other source off the shelves.",0
"Constructing a building was hard, but attempting to build the world's tallest building was intense. The mast a top the Empire State Building caused many obstacles for the builders such as having to strengthen the frame work of the whole building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework."" The architects also wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, or decorative.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the willingness of Saeng to overcome the obstacles and adapt to her new life.

Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin.

In addition, in the text it says, it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel. Saengs past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saengs new recollection and hope to prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world.",0
"Laughter is the so called ""best medicine"". I do not believe that to be true, however my nephew MONTH1 have other thoughts. My nephew was ""sick"" for every school day for two weeks. ""CAPS1 just doesn't like school"", I would tell his grandma. The thought of school being no fun and not liking it changed drastically for my nephew.  We let him think it was going to be another boring school day, but it was party day for them. Every two weeks if they work hard they get a party, lucky for CAPS2 they have been working diligently. The stubborn side of my nephew was showing it's ugly face that morning as CAPS1 fought every move we made. When we walked through that narrow door PERSON1 did something uncharacteristic, to him and five year old's all over the LOCATION1. CAPS1 stood as still and silent as a marble statue. It couldn't have been better prepared! Streamers, balloons, food, party hats, and bags, they went all out for the first one of the year. The aroma made my stomach gurgle with desire. Above all they had desserts, cakes, cookies, pie, all of this cooked thirty feet from you. so you walk through that door and you mouth instantly fills with warm saliva. These children played with a ninja like ability, one moment in front of you, you blink, and just as fast as you blinked they disappeared. It took me an hour at least to find PERSON1 in that small room. As I realized though it's easier to sit down and let them find you. As my butt hit the cold, hard, and nearly unbearable surface PERSON1 was in front of me. CAPS1 had this ear to ear grin on his face that scared me, CAPS1 never had that big of a grin on his face unless CAPS1 had a plan. CAPS1 definitely had a plan, in seconds my face was soaked.  CAPS1 had been concealing a squirt gun behind his back, and had the escape route planned out. With the chairs and the short tables how they sat long legs and weaving through them did not go well together. It was extremely difficult to catch up in the room, but once we hit the hallway and I could extend my legs it was an easy run. His ear to ear grin disappeared once I caught him, but the laughter on both sides did not. CAPS1 MONTH1 have got my face but I got his head! My nephew loves school now. It's almost the end of his first year, and they still party hard, but thanks to us no more squirt guns. I think if we would have waited any longer it would have taken some more work to get him to like school. PERSON1 is a very smart, athletic and good child. CAPS1 will be just fine in school, plus CAPS1 is strong so I pity the child who fights him.",0

"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, both during construction and after. During The creation of the mooring mast, the architects had to figure out how to place it on top of the building, because the stress of the load and wind pressure would add stress to the building's frame; instead, they had to transmit the load and pressure to the foundation, modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. Builders also wantd the mast to be aesthetically pleasing, needing to make the tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, rising to a conical roof and illuminated from inside. After the creation Of the mooring mast, more difficulties arose. The safety of the mast was an issue, as the hydrogen-using blimps outside the U.S. were highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire as a result. The winds at the top of the building, too, created danger, for they constantly shifted from the violent air currents. Dirigibles would swivel around the mooring mast  Another obstacle was the law forbidding airships from flying too low over urban areas. It would be illegal, therefore, for a dirigible to tie up to the building Or even fly too close to the area.",0

And another obstactle was the lack of a suitable landing area.,0
"CAPS1 enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family. CAPS2 why I dont agree that people should be in ther computer more their doing things better in life. First, becacuse it's useful to exercise. Talking a walk around the nieghborhood of just going for a hike with people you know. Even better going to the gym its such a better way to spend your evening instead sitting infront of a computer doing nothing but to look at a screen all day and plus exercising makes you stay in perfect fit, healthy and strong for as long as you live. A computer can just kill you not in reality but sitting all day only on the computer eating when you feel like it and no exercise that is whats going to kill you and make you become so lazy to do nothing. I know nobody would want that for sure. CAPS1, enjoy nature live life the way it needs to. Gods creations of nature is the must beautiful thing in this world dont let it go all to waist. Jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face. Make imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about. Third and last, interact with your family and friends. Spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels. Go with them for some ice cream. Dont let them feel left out or unloved. The mall is a great way to spend time with your friends or family also going to water parks like six flag or lake compound of place like nomads or chuckie cheese its a great way places to spend and interact with your family and friends it also can bring closer as well. This is why I think sitting infront of a computer screen all day, first its a waist of time when you go do some exercise or CAPS1 enjoy nature or lastly interact with your family and friends, CAPS2 why sitting infront of a computer as a waist of time and negative why to spend your days of living life. Technology holds you back from the real things in life. Thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration. Good day!",0
"Many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly.  In other peoples eyes you MONTH1 find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences.  All of which peoples opinions are created by life experiences and many tragedy' they have been apart of.  You will find sooner or later that some of the problems that many people deal with, that there is someone who has a lot worse than you do and that you should enjoy every moment you can.     Opinions are alternated often about many different things, being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often.  In my opinion it doesn't really matter whether your homosexual or not you have to understand that everyone is different in there own way.  Exceptence is what' key to making eveyone get along at some point, but people struggle with homophobia.       Another big debate that many people have are with female and male opinions.  It seems as if they dont get along because they disagree, but neither could live without each other.  It's nearly impossible to find a male or female who agree' with you PERCENT1, unless there pretending to be something there not.  From life experiences from parents arguing, friends fighting, and other relatives you see people forgive and forget so easily because the world is supposed to gifted and cherished everyday.

I also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across.  It helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through.",0
"Laughters importance in human life   In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter. CAPS1 and friends always come together and share a good laugh, it's why we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My CAPS1 every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favorite times becuase when my CAPS2 shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying becuase you are laughing so hard. He has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day. CAPS1 is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have yourself a great time! My CAPS2 has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny, it is the timeing in which he does it. I wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face becuase not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough, and you never know taht person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then it's a domino affect. Heshe will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else's day better just by a small and simple laugh.  Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another, sometimes thats all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. So every one can share a good laugh, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a ""hoot and a holler"" every now and then. When I met now my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgetable laugh. From that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us, so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh.  Laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in. The military has to go to war and live in an hostile inviroment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. It is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter that wants to come out. When your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becuase the people that truely care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day, it's like a refreshment for your body. When i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life becuase it can turn anything negative into a positive. When you go to a party with CAPS1 or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing, no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody.  I believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person, it shows who they are becuase nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny, it's just not possible for somebody to do. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need. When two or more people are gathered the ability to create an enviroment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this, it is so true ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"".",0
"Newspaper editor          I have recently been faced with a situation that has made me feel rather uncomfortable at my local library, I saw a rather graphic magazine being displayed in front of the entire library. Now I know that those magazines are, for some, a point of interest, but to others they seem a tad bit crude. It also came to my attention that magazines arn't the only form of crude murchandise on the selves of our local libraries. They are also littered with movies, books, graphic posters, along with, what i find to be explicit music. I know that it would be unreasonable for me to ask for the removal of the murchandise, but I would like to display a comprimise that could come into play.      What I believe to be crude, MONTH1 for some be acceptable, but why should I have to be uncomfortable at a public place, while the other is unphased. I believe that I have come up with a very simple comprimise, that would benefit me, as well as keep the murchandise avaiable. Now most, to all should know that there are children sections in most, if not all libraries. So I say this, what if we were to place all the explicit material in its own section, that way customers whom seek the material now know were to go to recieve it. This way, I believe would lower the uncomfortable-ness of going to our public library.      The benefits of this comprimise seem endless, to me. This way the children are left with a safe enviroment to pick out their books, and the adults that find it explicit have a comfortable surrounding to enjoy their excursion to the library. Though I am not trying to benefit those whom seek the material, I think it would. This way all of the material they want can be found in one place, and they won't have to go searching the entire library for it.     I think I speak for most when I say that our public libraries need to be a safe, family friendly enviroment, not only for children, but for those who wish to enjoy their library expierence.

"Have you ever had the time completely fly by while you're on the computer? You go on at TIME1pm and all of a sudden it's seven at night. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there. You're not moving around at all. Seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight. Being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of DATE1. Nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. People should spend a lot less time on their computer. When you're on the computer, time really flies by. You lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? You can be alone on the computer in a dark room. You should be with your family and and friends. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow. Don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them? You're changing too, so you MONTH1 be off to college or have to move far away for buissness. ""They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye."" my grandma said to my mom. Almost PERCENT1 of parents feel that same way. So, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and chairish each moment. People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library MONTH1 not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place? If you're doing a report on LOCATION2 for school it would be a lot of fun to go to LOCATION2 for a few days to learn about it. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as LOCATION1, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun?",0

The main reason movies should be censured is because movies that are rated CAPS1 are not only supposed to be rented by children but it wrong to rent these movies to them. I mean if there is a sex scene or something and your only like eight years old this would be awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing. I mean if you were a parent would you want to explain to your eight year what sex is.      The next thing that I think should be censured at the library is magazines. I know three in perticular off the top of my head, and they are CAPS2, CAPS3, and ORGANIZATION1. These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed. I really don't any kid, teenagers included should need to know how to be better in bed. They also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try. This could cause them to get very sick and if they're already skinny, they could possibly die.      Well this pretty much sums up what I think about library contents being censured. I don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids ears and eyes. I mean there are romances but I don't think any kid is going to last thru a whole romance, because they are pretty boring. Well I hope this will prevent libraries from letting kids get ahold of this kind of content",0
"CAPS2 name is PERSON1 and I am writing this letter on the count of the computer issue. CAPS2 look on this subject is the oppisite. People MONTH1 spend more time on the computer then exercising, but theycould still be social in chat rooms. People can use laptops out doors. You can spread your imagination with the games you can play. Lets get onto CAPS2 first point, being social. The experts say that people are spending less time with there friends and family then on the computer. They MONTH1 be spending less time with there friend and family physicly, but who said there not being social. Theres facebook, CAPS3, and chat rooms. You can talk to your friend on there so they on being social. Not being physicly social but verbily social. On to CAPS2 next subject the expert say were not enjoying out doors, but the over looked something here it is. If were not enjoying outdoors then half of amarica would be as plae as can be. Then theres laptops. You can use thoughs out doors. People that have laptops can go outside on a sunny day grab some fruit and relax. You could stay out there till the batterie deis. Then just grab the pluge and keep relaxing its easy. Computers also help your imagination. Some computer games help expand your imagination because when your playing games you think of things that could make the game better. Simulaters help you design or even controll things. Some games allow you design and play as a character you created. They help you jobs that you might be intrested in. For me computer games expanded CAPS2 drawing. All these thing can be reversed. No one is a robot that repeats what they do over and over again. Humanity has the power to get off the computer, and go outside or be social. As I just proved everything you can physicly you can do on the computer.",0

The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist.,0
"The Empire state building is one of the greatest symbols of the United States. With the world trade center destroyed, it stands as the city's highest building. Many are familiar with its famous spire at its summit, but few actually know why it's there. The truth is that it was meant to be a mooring dock for dirigibles, or zeppelins, balloons lined with steel that were equipped with propellers for steering.          The sad truth is that it never happened. According to the article ""The Mooring Mast"", the environmental conditions as well as safety condition, were too poor to accommodate. Apprently, the wind currents at such a high altitude are fears, and if a blimp were to be tethered to the top, quite a great deal of strain would be placed on the building frame. This is time-consuming and costly to fix. Also, there would be no practical way to weigh down the baloon without the risk of the falling on civilians. Not only that, but having air ships that low over urban areas was illegal. In short, the whole idea was wishful thinking, because it couldn't have happened.",0
The builders of the empire state building CAPS3 many different obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The CAPS1 CAPS2 was to be able to design the mast without having to reconstruct a big part of the building. Also a big aspect of it was that they had to face was to be able to make it safe. These big dirigibles can be very flammable and having something that major in a very populated city like new york would be very risky and unsafe. The last problem they CAPS3 was nature. Of course you canot change nature so this was a problem was there since the beggining but was probably overlooked or never even thought about. So this really never would of been able to suscesfuly work without any problems.,0
"CAPS1 you have a computer at home you enjoy? Computers are a big thing now in life, they help with many things. Such as staying organized, studies, and even entertainment. These are the three topics I will focus on, because I CAPS1 believe that computers are useful and people use them a help to make life a lot more easy. Let me start by saying: ""I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search music, watch videos on youtube, get school work done, and much more! Although, on main point is it helps me stay orginized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, does work, videos, pictures, and much more saved and orginized so I know where it is everytime I go to find it. There can be no more, ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer, you can add without earasing as well, the work becomes neat and perfect everytime. So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch alows you to get. More information, the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now, because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squigle line. This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling. You can even get CAPS2 to play a book you are reading, witch helps you learn new words that you MONTH1 not have knew how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework, when projects are CAPS1, ext. No more, ""I didn't knowremember what was homeworkproject due. Lastly, entertainment is the biggest thing with computers. People go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about what ever they want. Games are played on computers by younger kids, just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one. Myspace, facebook, twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyoneto just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, to CAPS1 what ever. Those are endless possibilities at entertainment on a computer. Without a dobt, no more, ""I'm bored"". CAPS1 you use your computer to CAPS1 anything like this? If so you must enjoy it. People use computer for every thing from work to expressing feelings. Now what side are you at?",0
"Saeng finds comfort in memories of her homeland. When she took that test, everything was unfamiliar to her, so she failed, but on her way back something familiar found her.

Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that never giving up is important is presented and carried out hopefully through the characters vow. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with.

"It seems like everyday of everyone's life they are being tested in every way shape and form and it seems like it will never end. It gets to be stressful and complicated but this is what makes us human. Something else that makes us human is laughter but no matter how bad things get to be it can always be changed by a knock knock joke, comic ad, or just one word from a best friend. Iv been with my dad and a couple of his high school buddies as they are telling stories about some of the crazy stuff they did when they were in high school. My dad and his friend CAPS1 went off into a story about when they bought a NUM1 LOCATION1 tempest for MONEY1. It turned out to be the greatest life lesson and some of the funniest stories in my life.  This was my dad's second car he ever had with a NUM2 and a NUM3 speed anything was possible. It started out when my dad first drove it to school which didn't last long, because an hour later. CAPS1 and my dad left doing a burn out on speed bumps in the school parking lot. This car was a burn out animal backing up then side stepping the clutch to second and it would all be up in smoke. One day my dad was sliding around gravel corners and one of the rear bias ply tires blown out it thrown that car into the ditch and messed up the side pretty bad. Joe enders pulled him out and half a gallon of dera glass a hammer and a can of paint later it was ready to go again.  The next story I heard was when my dad's friend borrowed the car he needed something to get him back and forth to work. So my dad hands him the keys and says ""keep it on NUM3 wheels"". Two weeks later on a weekend he was out messing around and the car slid off the road and rolled a few times and buckled the roof. I never heard how he got out but somehow he did and returned the car to my dad. After that it had an organ transplant of a roof from a CAPS2 that hit a tree, NUM5 weeks later and it's ready to go again. Now it's just something about a rear wheel drive car and snow that makes us kids again. sliding around in snow was the last thing this car ever did. My dad and CAPS1 were driving in the snow having fun when the back end decided to trade places with the front. They lost control as they slid across the winter wonderland to a lonely telephone pole. The car slid into the pole and it was the end of fun. Finally the car had died and my dad had brought the car back home. He decided not to fix it and parted it out he sold the NUM3 speed for NUM7 MONEY1 the engine for NUM8 and the rear end for NUM9 the trunk and hood weren't far behind for another NUM9 the seat, steering column and radio my dad kept, the rest was scrap. So all in all my dad had some of the greatest moments of his life for no more than gas money and a few spare parts. God bless LOCATION2 and I hope someday soon I can have memories like that.",0
"What exactly is laughter? Is it when something virtuous happens and it makes a person joyful? According to PERSON1's CAPS1, laughter is a cause of merriment. In other words a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself. An example of laughter being important in relationships is, when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this empty-headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming instinct. It had been almost two years exactly, since her and I haven't spoken. I thought nothing would brings us together, until one day when I was at the store and we ran into each other. We just looked at one another and just started laughing. Right than and there we figured out that the argument we had was pointless, and not worth talking about. To be more clear with this story is that without laughter my friend and I would have never been reunited. When you meet new people what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy you? You usually tell jokes, or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them. This is where laughter ties into life, physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual. When you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common. I guarantee that in every single friendship laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way of getting around it. Another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job, or going to a job interview and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality. What do you most often do in this type of situation, either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes. If this doesn't work well at least that person has a good idea about your personality. Learning how to handle life can become very stressful, also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine just graduated from college and she was struggling on trying to find a job that she studied in. She was very stressed out, and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on. CAPS3 didn't know what to do, no money was coming in yet, and she couldn't find an apartment she just was a mess. Until one day she told me that she revived a call from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass. CAPS3 rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed. Her grandma grabbed her hand and told her, ""I know life can be mean and just give you no chances but you have to get through that and enjoy life. Life's to short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst."" CAPS2 and there CAPS3 realized that what her grandma had said was true. You can't live through life in a drag, just have to get up and take it. CAPS3 was very devastated about her grandmas lost, but CAPS2 again she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this she wouldn't have never known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crisis. She will always love her grandma.  When you learn how to take life as it comes people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve. Individuals learn in many other ways or some just don't learn at all. For example, CAPS3 learned from experience going on with school and struggling with tying to find a job. Her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well. Other people learn form meeting new people, and just having fun with life, or like me I learned the hard way by not talking to a very good friend of mine over a empty- headed argument. Laughter comes in different shapes and sizes, we as human beings have to approach it, whether it's an argument or learning it as it comes. One way or another it will come and we have to be ready for it, its not a scary thing. The benefits of laughter is it makes you happy and people tend to be having a good time. Laughter is a positive thing, and people shouldn't ignore it, its a good stress reliever as well. Laughter is a cause of merriment, a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself.",0

"When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building there were many challenges architects and builders had to over come. First were the basic problems of any transportation hub, how to move people and baggage around the terminal. Another more complicated problem was how the compensates for the added stress on the building's frame from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This problem was solve by MONEY1 redesign of the Empire State Building frame. Also mored dirigibles would be constantly swing around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a danger to people on the streets below. The architects could not design a way to hold it drigible in place. Eventually the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building was scrapped.",0
I was about ten when this story happened to me. I was with my grandma when the story happened. We were at the park and I put my head in the monkey bars. My grandma had went to the bathroom and I was stick in the monkey bars.The kids at the park thought it was funny and were laughing at me. I was really embarrassed.When I got my head out of the monkey bars I told the kids that they should try putting there head in the monkey bars. The other kids tried doing it and they all got there heads stuck in the monkey bars. The kid did not know that I had practiced putting my head in the monkey bars so that it would not get stuck. I was laughing very hard at what I had just done and when my grandma came out I asked if we could go home. The next day we went back to the park and I got some different kids with the same trick. What I don't get is if my head was stuck why would they try the same thing. The kids this time told there mom and dad what I did and they told my grandma and I got in a lot of trouble.We went home and I was grounded for about two weeks. The next time I went to the park I did the same thing. That shows that kids will be kids.,0
The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the good way. For examples he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the contest of cycling.,0

"In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read.  For instance movies, are we going to go let a NUM1 year watch a rated CAPS1 movie much less let himher watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it.  Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they MONTH1 not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for.     Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated CAPS1 film called 'CAPS3's CAPS4'. After watching all NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again.  Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible.     To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section.  This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well.  I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas?     Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up.  There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the CAPS3.  If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is.  Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is.  Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever.  Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things.",0
The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didnt know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasnt really sure about.

"A recent study by scientists shows that too much sitting down, especially in front of computers is dagerous to health. This is only one reason why I think that, although they are useful, computers are not entirely beneficial to our society. The hinder us from excersising, interacting with nature, and spending time with family and friends. Excercising, as we all know, is necessary to remain as a fit and health human being. But how is this possible with some people going to work everyday and getting shut in their offices at their computers all day. Too much computer time even for kids, can lead to obesity and overweightness. Also, like I mentioned before scientists have concluded asked, that too much sitting is bad for you. It isn't how the body was built to work. If you have seen wave, one of ORGANIZATION1's most recent movies, undertaking is easy. The humans in that movie, after relying on computers for so long, became obese and fat and had no muscle. This is an of course, but minor visions of this are going around the world. Going out do instead of sitting a computer is a sure way to healthy. The next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to experience nature. Even simulations don't cut it. If you wanted to see a frog or of some other animal, can't just ORGANIZATION2 it, look for it in the real. Developing a connection to nature can really nurture the use of that is and ill. Instead of exploring a computer, explore the world as we know it until it's or you're too old. Learn how to do somthing by. Instead of hiring someone to make at, make it yourself. Do it to learn it, sit at a computer website to hire someone! Get up and get outside! As you become more dependent on your computer, you become less dependent on family and friends. It causes there to be a lift between family members. Your family might not be able to help you when you're in need. If you're an adult, and you're on the computer all the time for something other than work, then your not supporting your family, you have no income, no life, and no future. Why would anyone do this to themselves? Imagine this!:You have nothing except your laptop. You're a , on and have family relations. Nobody wants to be that kind of loser living on the streets! You have nobody and nothing except for your computer, and you've wasted your life away. Too much time on your computer means that everyone suffers. To sum it all up, computers maybe, but every single cloud has a dark lining. Computers stop us from exercising, interacting with nature, and being with our families. So get outside!",0

"Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from old timers the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly NUM1 miles; thats extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasnt really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didnt help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldnt have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life.

"Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?",0
"In the essay, Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, The sun was beginning to beat down, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a modernized town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park.",0
"A time I was patient was when I had to baby sit little cousin. He was just a little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset that I coudn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else.",0

"I think that they libraries should not remove any of the books they have now. If parents or people dont want to read those type of books they dont have to. But they should'nt be removed. I agree that some books are inappropriate and have bad language in them but thats part of the book and how the story was made. When a book is made they way it is and is already published there should'nt be any changes made to it.            If a story contains a certain scene that a person believes should'nt be in the book, that person needs to put that book back and choose another book they think is appropriate. Some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind. I know I do. In libraries they have books with inappropriate language and scenes discribed but to a certain age. I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, and thats a good thing because by that age you know things better and your parents should'nt be too worried. So in my opinon I dont think they should be removed from libraries. On the other hand movies that have scenerios that are disturbing should be removed.           Movies are a whole different thing then books. They show the material that is being described and I dont think teens should be watching that. They can be very unappropriate and disturbing to some people like me. I would'nt want to watch that in front of my mom or dad and especially a younger sibbling. Then again its just my opinion. If parents are okay with there child or children watching that then it should'nt be a problem.           Music is'nt that bad. There are a lot of parents who dont want there child or children listening to a sertain type of music because of their religion and what they believe in. I totally agree. My parents at the beggining would'nt let me listen to music where all they would do is sing about sex and curse over and over. As I got older they did'nt care much because I would'nt listen to it as much. Im a teen and I also believe that some of the music now in days in not very appropriate for anyone at any age. Some of what they sing does'nt even make much sense. In libraries I think they should only have music that realates in some how to the books.     Magazines are not really a problem. Most of the magazines talk about beauty and fashion tips. They have horoscopes and give advise. A lot of the magazines keep people updated on celeberties and there life style. It has some what gossip. There mostly for older teens and grown ups. For younger teens and kids there's more appropriate magazines where they talk about younger celeberties.      This is my point of view on things. I know that a lot of people dont entirely agree with me but this is what I think. I also know that there MONTH1 be a lot of people who agree with me and they'll most likely give the same reasons as I did to support their choice",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, including nature, safety, and the law, when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders' first imediate concern was for the structure of the building. When moured, the dirigible ""would add stress to the building."" To counteract this added weight, the building would need to be modified and strengthened. The builders were also worried about safety after a German dirigible was destroyed in a fire. Since the gas used to keep dirigibles aloft are highly flamable and downtown New York is so densely populated, they realized this could be very dangerous. The greatest obstacle was the high winds on top of the building that, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be swiveling in the wind. While lead weights could be used in open landing fields, these would be neither safe nor practical when hanging above pedestrians on the streets. Lastly, there was a law existing stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the building. The combination of these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to ever dock at the Empire State Building.",0
"To this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like the computer. Some think computers have a posotive effect on people. Others are concerned that people spend too much time on them. I think that both these opinions are correct. Although using a computer can become an addicting and unhealthy habbit, they teach a person everyday about something, are enjoyable, and help save the earth. Using computers is something I know millions of people use everyday, and would think CAPS2 would be difficult to live without. For example, my family owns four computers. We each have our own specific reasons for using them. For my mom, CAPS2's usually working or checking her e-mails. For me and my sister, CAPS2's researching and typing of homework, and communicating with our friends via facebook or. So say when my mom is working, or me and my sister are researching something we learn. Before these were computers, everyone used, but now that we have the internet, theres no really need to get a book. Most of the time people wont even have the book their looking either have to go out and buy get one from the library. Now this is an inconvenience to people, so why not use the internet thats quick, and. People also use computers to like I mentioned above with maybe facebook, CAPS1, or e-mail.CAPS2's quick, easy and fun. CAPS2 also saves paper which helps the planet. We always use to send letters, but now with these sources, you don't need to much! Computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on bring. Now even though I mentioned all those good things, there are unfortunately bad ones too. So many people use computers everyday, and CAPS2's bad for your physical and mental health. People spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted. This means they will be on them all the time, and never do other things like go outside. They wasn't exercise which could be bad for their physical health. Also, staring at a screen all day is bad for your eyes, and brain. So I think, due to these causes, people shouldn't use them constantly. In conclusion, I'd like to say that people should use computers for learning things, go outside or do something active because spending all this time on computers can result in physical and mental health issues. Thank you and I hope you agree with my statements.",0
"When the Empire State Building was NUM1 conceived, it was planned to be the tallest building. However not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. In the DATE1's, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships. However in trying to do this the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, & this is where the first obstacle they faced comes into play. Since the dirigibles were so long the first obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also the architects could not simply drop a mooring mask on top of the Empire State Building's roof. That plus a NUM2 ft dirigible moored at the top, we had stressed to the building's fram. This would be another obstacle the workers encountered. The mooring mask was destined to never fulfill its purpose, do to the safety of many people. This was yet another obstacle the workers faced. The final obstacle and the practical reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the building, was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. These are the many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building.",0
"Human beings, like snowflakes, are very much alike in a unique way. Just as there are no two identical snowflakes, no two humans are exactly the same. As everyone has their differences, there are always those who have a greater sense of curiousity, and prefer to think outside the box. However, it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge, if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study. Therefore, if a person is mature enough, and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library, they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing, with permission of a gaurdian of course.     Unfortunately, it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority. Libraries often times take in account a child's age as a factor towards what a they can, and can not read, but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read, and handle the more adult rated intell in a fashionable manner. If one is legally eligable, and they have permission from their gaurdian, then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library what-so-ever. Who is one to say a ten-year-old is too young to learn about PERSON1 and his horrible plans for the CAPS1? A person is never too young, or too old to learn something new, if the curiousity and the proper level of maturity is present!     It is curiousity that has led mankind to discover something new each and every day. As well, it is curiousity that has brought mankind to the extraordinary level of technology, and inventions that it is at today. The youth of the present will one day be the engineers, doctors, scientists, and moving leaders of the future. If these young people are curious, and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons, then let them be!",0
"I think that no source of knowledge should taken off any shelf in any librairy because a few people think it's offensive. In my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable. People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it. Some of the best books on our shevles are the ones that MONTH1 be offensive.     Some books are racist; Of CAPS1 and CAPS2 for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks. If everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when i'm older. I know that all the older books would be gone to and then no one would know about what happened in the NUM1's. Also some of the ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse then the books people read,if you find a book offensive don't read it!     When i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it. It gives the book charactor and makes it humorouse. We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while. Sometimes from thoughs books you even learn something about your self that makes you wonder if i didn't read this book would i still have found this out. Sometimes it brings out the best in people and thats the best part about reading a book like that.     Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take that away from people. I want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out. If you ask me it's just not right to take away someone elses choice of knowledge. Thats my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries.",0
"Patient day. I remember the time when I was patient for a toy car. Four CAPS1 I hate to waent for NUM1 whole days. Each day it felt like I was in jail. So I was getting mad each day slaping people in the face it was so funny so my CAPS2 CAPS3 was mad at me. then my mom put me on punishment. Then couple days later I was dooing good in school. So my mom was so proud of me. Then she bout me a lot of stuff. Later that chirstmas day we had turkey ranch dressing. Then I open my presents. I got the toy car, NUM2, monster truck cars shoes and ORGANIZATION1s blue, red, CAPS4 any collars you can think of. So that is why I was patient that toy I was so happy and my CAPS5 stop by and gave me NUM3 dallers. Then he took me ice CAPS6 shade to were these skinny tites.

"Censorship in librarys could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see. In the kids section, they have kid's books. In the adult section they have adult books. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that MONTH1 be what their parents don't want them seeing. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended.     Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. I am a big reader so I have been to librarys many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there.      For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have 'CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3' stickers on them. It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too CAPS1 or not. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated CAPS4 or above on those shelves. Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before. I'm sure they would never have magazines such as 'CAPS5' or 'ORGANIZATION1' there. People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience.      That is my solution. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. You couldn't take away movie classics like 'CAPS6' or 'CAPS7'. Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists. Yes, they are rated CAPS4 but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies. Don't take the material out. Just make a new section for it.",0
"I am writing you today to propose an explanation on my views of censorship in libraries. I recently had visited a library and some of the things I read in my time being there was really overwhelming.I think it should be censored and taking off the shelf. If you are a place of business you should not want things like that on your shelf. You should not want costumers reading it and feeling disgusted. I hope something I write will propose my reasons.              I have plenty of reasons to censor things and have them taking off the shelves that are offensive to me and others who visit the library, but only speaking on my behalf there were certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., that was offensive. I believe things in the nature should be handled in great authority. If anything I am trying to help me and my fellow citizens.              Just think if a visitor come in and pick up a magazine and it has insulting visual details of something that the reader can relate to or have experienced, and it is getting talked down about instead of beeing looked at, then they would be very offened. For them to come there it had to be a reson that they came, I know it wasn't so they would feel insulted. It is very inappropiate to have things that are offensive in the library.                It is plenty of different reason people come to libraries. Some come to get away, and to others its a daily routine. Whatever the case maybe they should feel comfortable in the place they are at. Why would you want people in the community or people period to not be comfortable where they are at. Just think if they are uncomfortable, then they are going to tell others and you will loose alot of fellow friends and alot of business. Think strongly on the things you do and the way you approach things to get peoples attention.                          To answer the question CAPS1, I agree strongly on getting the offensive materials moved from the shelves. I believe in making people happy and one thing that is wrong with society today is too much judging and talking down and talking bad about people. If people would not judge or insult people then the world would be alot safer. It has to start somewhere, every little start causes for a great ending. I think this would be a good start on making the world happier and bringing all of us closer together. I hope something I wrote will help you on your descision",0

"Computers, a LOCATION1 topic if you ask me. Sure they arnt very good for you dosn't mean if you use it correctly then it can be a souce of life. Computers are helpful in many ways, they can be an information post. The social networks can help your kids get more interactive with the world. During school kids have projects and without computers. Read on as I will explain in details. Computers, as you know, are one of the worlds greatest information posts. NUM1 out of ten people survayed said that the computers are a value of everyday life, The earthquake in haiti is recovalng now, but half the world wouldnt know that with out computers so have a heart, and dont take away the most valued info in the world. Secondly, what would you say if I told, you that kids are more socialy retarded than ever! Well its true. Over NUM2 of the worlds people rely on intractive websites to comunicate with each other. Fact, children have more friends over the internet then ever. You dont want to be the LOCATION1 in all this do yours ar know as the person who kept kids from living? I dont think so. Lastly, all people in school use computers to do projects, for instance PERSON2 had horrible hand writing and this was the bigest project of the year. So he turned his computer to type it, he gets on at. But what if there was (CAPS1) computer! PERSON2 would have gotten a CAPS2 - for the project. In fact teachers CAPS3 wear tell kids to type hwprojects. PERSON1 says ""CAPS3 year kids pass my class by typing and if they then they would all flunk!"" CAPS4 got the point but more importantly do you?! To sumit all up for those of you lazy enough to not read there story essay. Computers are used for everyday needs such as finding out information. Makeing friends, or doing projects. So are you gonna be the person who sits back and lets that happen or are you going to get up and stop the maddness once and for all. Its you choice but think of the socity retarded, dumb kids that fail the grade CAPS3 year.",0
"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" written by ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There are three main reasons why the CAPS1. S.B. was not used for the purpose it was constructed for. The point of the CAPS1.S.B. was so that dirigibles can stop and refuel. Dirigibles is an old word for Blimps. The obstacle the CAPS1.S.B. had to over come were modifications, nature, and the law. They had to pay MONEY1 in modifications on the CAPS1.S.B. for the framework. The second was nature, the winds would make the back of the Dirigibles move around, they wanted to put weights on the back of them but that was not safe. Last but not least the law, the dirigibles cant be as low as the CAPS1.S.B. because its too low and they cant fly low over urban areas.",0
"During this time period, dirigibles were seen as the transportation of the future, and everybody thought that this was plausible. There were problems, however, that nobody saw through. For example, the dirigibles were seen to be the next big thing in transportation, but there was no evidence to support this. They spent all of their time, effort, and resources to construct something for a purpose that never worked. There were other problems that were overlooked as well, such as the wind speed at that height, and even if they could get close enough to the mast, they would need someone to stand on the very top and tie it down, which would be too hard for one person. As the excerpt shows, Al Smith and his architects jumped into this problem too quickly and with insufficient information.",0
The mood in the story is happy. Growing up the main character had a great sense of family. He states his realatives usually join them for diner.

"In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story.",0
"The media is destroying our youth! this is something we hear everyday. Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright. Because of these people, we think that the media is repsonsible for the wrong in the world of DATE1. The truth is that it isn't the medias fault, it is the parents. It is the parents responsiblity to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of DATE1 will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships. When their is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes agiainst their beliefs, and destroy our god given right to freedom of speech    Censorship will detroy the knowlege available DATE1. We have had seen censorship in our history. When we look back we see that the ORGANIZATION1's censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the custums, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it. We could potentailly be destroying somones way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrows masterpeice. In censoring we would be detroying history.By destroying history we would be detroying the brilliance that is learning.     If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any christian if they would allow their children to read the muslim book of faith, the LOCATION1, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a muslim if they would let their children read the CAPS1. The point is that if their is cansorship we would be destroying other peoples beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world.     Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow peole to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinionsand theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would hav eto say. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more.      Of course their will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like.Their will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we dont want to see.  If you dont want to see dont look. Just dont close everyone elses eyes because you dont like what you see.     Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship. We cannot alow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us. Our media is too intertwined with our lives. Who's right is it to decide what is right for our lives. If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop. They will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship",0
"ORGANIZATION1 CAPS1 opinion is getting out of mind. They're people who are getting addicted to to CAPS2, such as games, websites, communication and email websites and etc. Therefore, they're people who are just plain addicted to the computer, such as CAPS3.

So they dont cooperate correctly with there school work (so they get bad grades) or they loose connection with family members and friends (so they become lonely and depressed).

Also other effects on the computer is if your addicted to a website (in generaal) you can get out of shape, because your not spending enough time excersing, there is already enough people in LOCATION1 that is obesed and it is already a add on to the problem. I read online than in LOCATION1 is obesed. So computers are a addiction waiting to happen.

"When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, big problems became apparent to them that caused complications in docking dirigibles. One factor was that by law, dirigibles couldn't be that low above the city, as they could accidently  crash into a building and fall onto the crowds below. Another factor was the air currents around the tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the winds would violently rock it, and could crash against the building and fall to the streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Nobody wanted to risk that happening over New York City, either. So because of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and by law, the builders had complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there.",0

Also he was letting us know that spring is here and that is not winter nomore. Thats why she start to plant plants in the winter. So in the spring that can grow out to be nice and beautiful for the spring. Thats what i think the author meant. Also thats the reason why he put that in the paragraph. He should of add more to the paragraph like how the plants and stuff was growing so beautiful. He shouldn't add more details to let us know, what was talking about in this paragraph.",0

The ending reasures the reader so that you dont wonder how it will workout for Saeng.",0

For example, CAPS1 a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her, it could be a predator. She will never know unless they meet us somewhere. At this point, it maybe too late. Moreover, studies show that PERCENT1 of people's information is more widely exposed in the last NUM1 years due to the new chat websites. Such as myspace and facebook. In these websites, people share their information. With this, their safety is at risk. Finally, people should stop using computers as much as they are now, in order to keep their safety safe. Furthermore, enjoying nature is a must, in our world full of immense landscapes, wide waters, dense forests, and lush valleys. CAPS1 you depend on your computer to teach you about the world, you should cease this use. One must actually be outside, experiencing the feel, the smell, and even the taste of nature. A recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a NUM1 page essay on what they had learned. The people who didn't go and simply read information off their computer, could not write this much. Finally, society needs to back away from their computers, and stop into. Thirdly, a person's social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons. One reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends. Sure, you can chat with people online, but that's nothing like chatting in person. There is no need to talk to a friend or family member online, when you could do it in person. Finally, CAPS1 someone takes an embarrasing picture of you and puts it on their computer, it is there forever. Thus, you can lose friends, whether you're the person in the picture or the addict who put the picture on. With this, you can easily ruin your familysocial life by using your computer too often. How would you feel CAPS1 it was your fault that someone's safety is at risk? Wouldn't you rather enjoy nature in person instead of which it on your computer and not get the fall effect? Couldn't you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer? There are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society. I encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life.",0
"Buzz, buzz! CAPS8 I hear CAPS1 your phone is CAPS2. so I got up and checked it NUM1 missed calls. I look who they are from at NUM2 all from CAPS6 dad. I felt something was wrong. I called him back and I hear CAPS1 get ready grandm CAPS4 I coming to get you. I said it`s NUM3 CAPS5 are you nuts? at this time I was at a family members house CAPS8 CAPS6 dad said PERSON2 was in a bad crush. CAPS6 heart drop and I started crying. get your stuff together and I will call you back with more info. I got off phone CAPS6 aunt was up she came into the room I told her what I knew. I was getting CAPS6 stuff together try not ta wake anyone else up. When I was waiting for the call everything went through CAPS6 mind. I was with him, what happened, is be ok is he going to die? CAPS8 I heard beep beep I said good bye and ran out. Running made me think of more like: how bad is he hurt, what was he driving, what was he doing out? I got in the car I questioned CAPS6 grandma asking her where is mom, where is LOCATION1, where is CAPS7 are they ok: when will I see him? All I knew in had to be patience. CAPS8 I got the call I asked CAPS6 dad what happen what did he hit, who called NUM4, where do we go? the first thing that came out of CAPS6 dads mouth was calm down I can`t come home but PERSON1 will be there I want you to stay with him ok yes dad I will and dad I said you he said back. I said I love you. I love you too he said. The worst time for CAPS6 life was waiting for PERSON1. PERSON1 and PERSON2 were CAPS6 dads when CAPS6 dad wasn`t home. I know I would be fine with PERSON1. How will be act seeing his bestfriend like that? PERSON2 and PERSON1 are fire men I wonder if they knew who helped PERSON2. I knew he was always there for me. Waiting was hand to do but I had to be patience. I remember closing CAPS6 eyes and wish it was a dream. Now I get to go in PERSON1 right behind me walking I seem all the glass on him CAPS8 dayna said look who is here he opened his eyes they got really big when seen me. CAPS8 PERSON2 said PERSON1 come here PERSON1 went. PERSON2 said thank you for taking care of CAPS6 little sister I love you man. That is the time in CAPS6 life I had to be patience to see CAPS6 brother.

"To whom it MONTH1 concern, CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend on the computer? Too many is my geuss! They are warping the minds of people all over, and in my opinion things should go back to the way they used to be. Some people MONTH1 disagree, and say that computers help children who are in school. That MONTH1 be true, but honestly only a couple decades ago the average student didnt even own a computer, and school were teaching the same materials without the usage of them. Also, some children use computers to cheat on homework assignments and essays, and I'm sure many people would agree that that is not helping education for schools. Another reason computers MONTH1 not benefit society is because of the dangers of them. Sexual predators sworm the internet, and many people talk to strangers over the internet that MONTH1 be harmful, without even realizing it. A third reason computers MONTH1 not be help society CAPS2 you can see, I feel very strongly about the negative effects that computers have on society, for many reason. I hope you can agree with me",0
"One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the construction of the mooring mast would add stress to the building due to its height. The architects, however, were able to design a special type of stainless steel that would be illuminated from the inside and provide support. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and having such an airship with flammable gas nearby civilization was considered unreasonable. Thus, a law was passed that forbid the transportation of dirigibles close to the public. Nature was also against the architects, and so posed a safety hazard when high-speed winds attempted to CAPS1 the dirigibles from the sky while being weighed down with lead weights. In the end, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never used due to these issues.",0

"CAPS1 a teanger growing up in this technologic era MONEY1 society, I think computers are more harmful than helpful. I presume that books are better resources, people can find fun in other ways and that computers can be dangerous and cause health problems. CAPS1 a well-read newspaper, your stand on this subject will influence the minds MONEY1 many. I know computers can help find information, but personally, I believe that books are better resources. Anyone can write and post an article on the internet, even if what they are saying is not true at all. People can lie and say they are a doctor in their NUM1's when they are really a NUM2 year old working at ORGANIZATION1. On the computer, you can never be sure who to believe, but with books you know what you're reading is accurate. The information on the computer, (that's true) you can find a book. Sure, the computer MONTH1 be the quicker or ""easy way CAPS6 "" in some cases, but maybe what people need is a challenge. It seems that because MONEY1 the growing technology, every generation gets lazier and lazier, and less and less into books and it's time for that to stop. Also, people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer. Many people use social networking sites to connect with their friends, such CAPS1 CAPS2, CAPS3 and CAPS4, but on those, you can't tell if that person is really who they say they are or not. If you want to talk to your friends, why not call them or more modernly, text them? That way you can be sure MONEY1 who you are talking to. Too many teens nowadays hide CAPS6 in their rooms and play games on their computers and spend less and less time with their families. What happend to playing cards and board games with your family? It's much more enjoyable, in my opinion if you play the game for real and not virtually. You can also go outside and get some fresh air, instead MONEY1 that muggy smell in your room because you're so busy on the computer, you forgot to CAPS5 the laundry. Plus, if kids have to start handwriting their papers that would improve their handwriting, because they wouldn't get the simplicity MONEY1 typing. Besides, some kids don't have access to computers, anyways and you have to handwrite your ORGANIZATION2's, so why not? Lastly computers can be dangerous andor harmful to health. The use MONEY1 social networks allows kids to put all their information CAPS6 there, for anyone to see. This can lead to bad things, like being stalked or kidnapped. The internet also carries many innapropriate images and websites, that youngsters, or anybody, really, should be looking at also staring at a computer screen for hours on end is very bad for your eyes and can cause very serious vision problems in the long run. Plus, I'm sure you've heard how many typists are more prone to arthritis or any problems with pain or loss MONEY1 the use MONEY1 their fingers because MONEY1 the movement MONEY1 your fingers when you are typing. Getting rif MONEY1 computers will help to impact peoples' well- being-in a positive manner. While many people enjoy the use MONEY1 computers, there is really not that great MONEY1 a need for them. Books are better resources, you can find fun in many other ways, and they can be dangerousharmful to health. Why spend hundreds or MONEY1 on a tool that is not even necessary? Don't let the media fool you or pull you in with their tricks, scams, or gimmicks to get you buy one, and next time you go to turn on your computers, thinks "" CAPS5 I really need this or is there a better way to achieve what I need to get done or what I want to CAPS5?"" because, more than likely there will be a better way. So, sometimes it's better to say ""CAPS6 with the new ways MONEY1 doing things technologically in with old ways MONEY1 doing things manually.",0
"Two of the many privaleges that we have as CAPS1 are freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Although some bodies of work MONTH1 be percieved as offensive or inappropriate, I believe that they should still be available to the public. Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others MONTH1 not; but they should not be removed from libraries because of their negativity.     These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned. Every person has a right to an opinion, and others MONTH1 or MONTH1 not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs.     Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self'. I myself have read literature that is considered offensive, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living.     I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ingorant to the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe. All of these books are educational, though some are harsh, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong. If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries then people, especially children could start to think that a certain idea, that MONTH1 be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable. As someone once said, 'CAPS2 who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'.     By removing the problem, we would be creating another issue. For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnicities, religions, and lifestyles. If CAPS2 works of literature were banned and not available to the public, many people would not know that it is wrong to show hatred towards others just because they are different than you. This type of literature provides usefull information: it allows people to see how a large amount of people thought life should have been years ago, and they taught the people of DATE1 that it actually was how people should not be living.",0
"CAPS1 name is PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing NUM1 to NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen CAPS1 reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers.",0
"CAPS1 if I was with or aganist people using computers. But I thought about it I decided that i was aganist using computers. For the same reasons, safety stop education, sites that are not appropriate to see. I know many people MONTH1 think how come using a computer is not safe. Well eventhough you are not talking to someone in person and only on the computer what you do over computer is not safe. The reason why is because most of the time there would be thats thirty and we be like NUM1, DATE1 and I use those ages because kids are age be the man one on CAPS2 myspace, but he can be like thirty and we be like NUM1 - DATE1 and us not knowing he comes on myspace or CAPS2 put another picture up there of young did we start thinking to him meet up and something had happend. For example my friend who was on myspace was talking to a fourty-one year old and then they met up but she did not know his age and she was rapped. Not everybody is true over the computer. Education is very important even for adults and children. Bieng on the computer is not going to bring are education up is going to brings down. The reason why this is most DATE1 threw NUM3 come home from school put there hookbag down eat and then do straight on myspace, CAPS2, CAPS5 instead of studying, reading, doing their homework. Eventhough those websites do help you learn but only about for myspace, read messages on CAPS2 look at people comments on CAPS5. Like for example I would go and instead of me learning new I am bieng and learning new information. Learning brings achievement, a computer brings not succeeding. There is not much I can say about sites thats not appropriate all I can say is watch what you on and see on myspace cause you might just but into something you not suppose to such as raped that went on. Be careful.",0

"just sitting in a chair in the computer getting fat. Also if you are going to be on the computer at least they to find a job on the computer. But I'm not talking about the people that work in computer all day long, because they have to do it. Its their job to. Thats one of my reasons. My second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family. The reasons I say this is because you could be on the computer and will interact with my family because you live it the same huge as them, two when you are not in the computer you could be with your family and spend time with them. That's why i said that you still could interact with your family even you see on the computer. The last and final reason is do people to spend most of their lifes on the computer. The person I like this because type of person would spend most of their life on the computer and don't go find a job go enjoy their life. Also if you got kids you have fun with your children and make them believe that they parents that was to them, that, they had fun with them, and that they had somebody that they could look up too. So don't spend your life time on the computer geting fat, not spending time with their children and make something yourselfs. But I'm not talking about the people that workon computers. I'm talking about the people that don't work on computers. Thats why I said don't let youre life pass by you. i hope you liked the prompt and that you wont spend a lot of your life in the computer doing nothing just getting fat and letting your life pass you.

"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builder of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. For example ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below,"" which describes that the problem that the builders would have to face if they applied the mast and with the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would mess up the foundation of the building. So the builders needed to find a way to not ruin the foundation of the Empire State Building. Another example is ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This evidence explains that if the mast was to be place the builders would have to strengthen the entire building so there would be no problems with the mast",0

When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guest: riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhasted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist.

"The world in full of offensive material, and there almost nothing we can do for it. These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large varity knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material.      On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items such as centain types of music of movies are inapropate his or her age. Some partents get really  offensive when they see something slightly inapropate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up.      In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have large mass of imformation to choose from becasue there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of cruiosity. For example somethings like ORGANIZATION1 and CAPS1 are taught in school and could be consided dangerous. In ORGANIZATION1 we learn the ways of atoms and  make make perdictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous enviroment. The same goes for CAPS1, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these CAPS3 we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous.     With everything that we do there is postive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strickly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it apears very useless.      In this large world there alway was and always will be people or material that are a bad influnce. Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different torances and values. With this on going problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our ablities, based off of our values",0

"Al Smith had an ambitious plan to put his Empire State Building on top of New York. He envisioned the skyscraper as a dirigible port and a future transport hub. Techical limitations eventually proved insurmountable though. First, dirigibles had to deal with docking in an urban area. Dirigibles normally dropped lead weights to secure there landings, but this would be impractical when people were on the streets below. Wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air. The wind would be ever more problematic in the city as if a Dirigible hit a building it would puncture and fall into New York city. Neither of the Dirigibles that tried to moor could because of wind and other buildings. As stylish as landing in the middle of LOCATION1 would have been, safety problem could not be fixed and there were too many people around to risk it.",0
"Mooring dirigibles would not be good at all if they were being moored on top of the Empire State Building. One of the reasons that mooring a dirigible on the top of the building is most dirigibles that would come to this dock from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The hydrogen is extremely flammable and after the Hindenburg exploded, it would be to unsafe to have a hydrogen filled dirigibles in a highly populated area such as New York City.Another obstacle that was being faced was a climate problem. This was the biggest problem. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" (paragraph NUM1). If the winds were this rapid the back of the dirigible would be swinging around freely. This could potentially cause danger if the back was to hit a building near by or start swinging out of control and break loose from the building.The last problem that was faced based on the story is that docking a dirigibles would be against the law. The exsisting law stated that an airship couldn't fly to low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock at the Empire State Building, it would be too low over an urban area. This made it impossible for the Empire State Building to have a dock for dirigibles.",0
"This is a letter about how I feel about the effects of computers. I think computers are great you can, interact with family and friends, learn about things going on around the world, and it could help you with school work. First I would like to say that you can interact with family and friends. You can just go on facebook, CAPS1, or,myspace and talk, send pics, and comment on other peoples things. There are many groups you can join too, wich allows you to talk to other people and meet new friends. You can also interact with your family if they have a facebook or CAPS1. The second reason why computers are not bad is because that there are many websites that you can find different information like science, math, history and all that kind of stuff. There are alot of different topics you can learn. You can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from. My last reasoning for thinking this way is that many kids do their homework on computers and if people are saying that computers are bad than the parents are not going to allow them to use the computer for educational purposes like homework and projects. There are many other reason why computers have a positive effects of people. But interacting with family and friends, learning about things around the world and your education depends on computers.",0

"Have you ever been to a library? Have you ever thought that some material from the libraries could and have been found offensive and wanted them to be removed from the library? I'm here to talk about the content of libraries and what we should do with them.           Every time you walk into a library, you are surrounded with books and other learning or reading material. Yes this material is helpfull in finding things to pass the time or to help understand a certain subject, but some have been found offensive. Stories such as romance novels or vulgar horror and action stories have been viewed as innapropriet to some ages. These novels contain anything from brutal horror, to adult material, or foul language. Parents argue that these books should be removed from the libraries.      I do not agree. I beleive that such books and novels can be a great help to the immagination of others and get the mind flowing. Yes i do agree that some novels are not age apropriate for young children, but that does'nt mean that they should be removed. I think that if people are so worried about their children reading these books that they should either go into the library with their child, or simply give the child a certain area that they are allowed to pick a book from.      Another way of avoiding these wrightings getting into the wrong hands is to section off the more aggressive and adulterated books to a certain spot in the library and allow only age apropriate people inside. An age restriction of thirteen years and up would be a responsible decision. An age younger could be innapropriate for them, but any older and it could keep them from learning and expanding their mind to it's full potential.     The point of this writing is to show that removing these books and novels from the libraries is not going to help anything. if anything it could hurt us by not allowing our minds to reach newer and higher limmets by learning and understanding the complexity of these novels. sectioning off these novels in an age apropriate area or having parental discression will help to keep the age correct for the books that they get",0
"Technology is a very useful thing But is also a bad thing, it makes people lazy on . A computer is a multi-use tool. Along with this people cango on any website . Anything, as in research or personal reasons. First off, let me point out that computers are useful multi-purpose tools. Computers can also, CAPS1 people slugish bor lazy. i feel this way because, to many people sit infront of computer instead of getting up & being active. Being acive gad and important for people. A lot of people are not active because they on the computer harms on end. Students sometimes go home and strayht oor tug computer instead of doing homework. Moreover, computers can help you pay bills. Do research, or maybe just for fun play games. There is an ulimeted number of websites & to cp on through to hep you with many of needs. Uploading family pictures from your last vacation? its simple with most computer soft . Finally, computers is kind of like one .

I think that computers are good for people to have. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kid might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have e-mails. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. Teachers mostly perfor to have the kids typ their eassys. When kids write eassy's they have to get information on what they are looking. My seocnd reason is kids might have to look important things on. They MONTH1 have to fill out an alpaction out online when kids get older they want to look up schools they MONTH1 want to go to. Kids in high school look up collages to get into when they are in like NUM1 or NUM2 grade. My third reason is kids migth have e-mails. When kids check their e-mails they are probably trying to see if their parents wrote them. Also some kids don't live near family so they e-mail each other on-line. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kids might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have an e-mail. Now I hope you like the reasons I wrote on why computers are good to have.,0
"The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly mens directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. Hes also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old mens directions. Hes really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if theyve lost it.",0
The setting features affected the cyclist because it was a conflict. It was a conflict because it was hot and he was lost. I was a confict that he was hot because he had a limited amount of water. Which he could get anymoe of because he was lost. The heat causes people to get thirsty but he couldn't because he was limited in water.Another conflict was that he was lost. This was a conflict that because he needed to be some where.,0
"Censorship of books     Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes because certain things need to be removed from the shelves for example many things that don't need to be seen out in public. Personaly I think censoring certain things is alright because there are certain books that shouldn't be seen, music that has either swearing talking about drugs or other things, movies that kids shouldn't see like the rated 'CAPS1' or 'NUM1' that has either blood or nudity or somethen on that line, and magazines now magazines there are many types of magazines like for example adult, children, cooking, cleaning, house things, stuff for dogs or cats, and outside stuff.      But censoring things that could be 'offensive' I can't understand how books can be offensive because some books are talking about history or something that has happen to them. Like for example lets just say a colored kid comes in and reads a book on 'CAPS2 slavery' that kid right there is going to get offensive about it and then that kid is going to say 'You owe me something because my anscetores were slaves' no your very wrong there kid because you either read the book wrong or you just didn't understand it. I have done that a couple of times either I got offensive about it and started getting very angry about it or just tose it in the trash because I got mad because I got offensive about it. Don't get me wrong I love reading but like I said before certain things are just ment to never be read or just never be found.     But as for me getting offensive about a couple of books, movies, music, or magazines CAPS13 I don't read magazines so I can't get offensive about that but books, movies, and music I take very offesively because like if I read lets just say the 'CAPS3 CAPS4' and then I watch the movies CAPS13 I take it offensively because nothing didn't tie in with the books or that person didn't direct it right.      For books like I said I love reading books don't get me wrong but I do take very offensively because like something the character did or something that I wished I shouldn't have done something like that or a character dies and it reminds me of a close friend of mine or a teacher something on that line I either cry or I just stop reading the book period.     Music now I could go all day on that because for example I used to love rap with a passion but now rap is just becoming horrible because the rapper is either talking about killing someone, drugs, or 'sex' it's like I said 'horrible' thats one thing that needs to go away for a long long time. But there are many other types besides rap. There is CAPS5, CAPS6, CAPS7 CAPS8, punk, CAPS1&CAPS10, etc like I said I could go all day on music.     The people who are censoring things like t.v. shows like for example CAPS11 CAPS12 seriously there is nothing wrong with that show some people are censoring that because adults think it is bad CAPS13 people there is nothing bad with that show. I have been watching it since I was five years old and there was nothing bad on it then, then why would there be something bad on it now. All there is, is a grown man acting like a child it's like your going to tell your husband or your wife or your kids 'CAPS13 CAPS14 I'm sorry but I have to censore you because your a bad person.'      I'm not saying that I would censore it I'm just saying maybe we as people should just take the time to look through some of these shows before censoring them.

"The mood of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is grateful, loveing, cheerfull, and fond. The whole memoir is looking fondly back at his home that he grew up in. He expresses his fondness of this time throughout the piece I his quote Narciso Rodriguez shows his gratefulness ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" This quote shows how he is grateful for everything his parents have done for him. He shows great cheerfullness through this quote from his memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows cheerfullness because it looks back on his family and enviorment in a positive and cheerful way. Throughout the whole memoir fondness and love is shown, but they are highlighted of the most in this quote, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" this quote expresses fondness of his home and love for his parents. In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is both loveing and fong as well as cheerfull and gratefull.",0
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was out of water in a desert like environment and their was no one ground for most of it so he was down on his own. The cyclist was affected when in the story when he says ''I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substaNce oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. That affected him because, he was drinking a lot of water before he got to that point in his trip and he was almost out so he needed to fill up with more but he did not have a place to get more water. That is one of the features of the setting that affected him.",0
"I believe that certain materials should not be removed if they are found innapropriate. There are several things that explain why I think this.     For one thing, some libraries don't have certain genres of books. For example, say one library MONTH1 have action but not thriller while another library has thriller but not action. If some materials were removed from public libraries due to censorship, people would only be able to find it online or in certain stores. Second reason being that kids would not get into these kind of books if it was innapropriate, unless they're given approval by parents. If these materials were to still be on shelves, you should at least be a certain age to read it, unless the parents make it to where their kids don't have to get approval from them first. Sure it would make the library more kid-friendly, but a book shouldn't be kept away from a kid only because of a few bad words. Lastly, some adults would be upset of the removal of some books. Some books that are intended would be better off staying in the library. If they were to remove these books, adults would then have to find a book online.     So censorship, to me, is not going to make any difference. If this continues, it MONTH1 lead so far, that the libraries would have to be closed. Take my word for it. In conclusion, don't let censorship take over our libraries.",0
"Computers! Computers! Computers! Computers seem to be the talk of the year. Many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life, but I would have to disagree. In my opinion we do not need computers. The effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing. Humans today are not spending as much time in nature and excirsising for a healthy body and a healthy planet. Also, as us kids are growing up, we have too many advantages because of computers. Thirdly, so much money is being used towards computers and not whats truely important! As you can see these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life. First off, as we continue to use computers our natural environment is going to waste. The effects on nature and people are horrible. Polution is being spread all over the planet! People are becoming addicted to computers. I know it will surprise you when I tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day! This is about half the day! This is a terrifying effect on people, because now these computers are brain washing us! Instead of going on the computer all day, we should be going outside to enjoy fresh air and the sun. Their the more, computers have us sitting inside all day and not getting any excirsive, which is a health issue we need to learn about the little things and be thankful for what we already have! Consiquently, banning computers would have a positive effect. Today, many are loosing their ability to write card forgetting about the simple things life has to offer would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so bad? This MONTH1 be old fashioned, but there are an enormous amount of great effects for using pen and paper. Maybe, the ORGANIZATION2 states would become smarter and contain more knowledge. By writing everything out is proven to help remember important facts easier and for a longer amount of time, writing on paper is like writing it in you brain. Therefore, students, children and adults would benefit by having better handwriting. Since most information is typed on the computer people are forgetting how to write neatly, clearly, and resonsibly. PERSON1 is an english teacher that has been with the ORGANIZATION1 school since before computers, she has seen the horrible effects taking place on her students right befor her eyes. PERSON1 told me, ""CAPS1, students are completely absorbed in computers and have no life, energy, or reativeness in them anymore! Kids have too many advantages with computers and not taking the time. Last, but most definetley not least is my third reason as to computers are effecting humans negetively. Humans are sending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology. Most of people pay chedes are being used for their computers. These fancey computers are very expensive, but also very useless. In my opinion many people are just following a trend. Instead, the money can be spent on schools, and especially the wars! Do you hear the humming of the computer the clicking of the buttons? Realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending! To wrap it up, computers effect people. There are many reasons to support this, but here are three. One is that people are not spending any time in nature! Another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality. Thirdly, people are using all there money on those computers! I know some people think computers are very usefull,but I know now, after you have read this article, you know how unuseful computers really are.",0
Patients is verey important. But I m not verey good with my patients. And when I am and I wait my turn I end up forgetting what I going to say. I guess I m not verey patient because my family is not verey patient. My family is not verey patient because we just want to say what were gona say before we forget it. Are family it also verey forgetful. That is probably another reason why we arnt patient. Patients is im portant because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait turn.

The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left.

For example And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton. She loved the way it made her feel. When one of the leaves fell off and she breathed in, it remined her of grandmother. CAPS1 might of experienced something like this. CAPS1 might of wrote this because the story could relate to other people who moved from another country and have something that brought back memories. Everytime that l touch or smell a sweater,it brings back memorises of my grandmother. I feel that he wrote this because of his personal experience and it could relate to others",0

"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. In addition, they lead to less interaction with real people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are harmful to our society. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between the DATE1 DATE2 and DATE3, doctors saw nearly a PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. Also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these cootraptions for over four hours each day end up with an extremely deteriorated vision by the age of NUM1. Finally, CAPS2 CAPS3 stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers. It can be seen, how work gets done faster, however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with real people. To begin with, studies have shown that people simply dont learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. Also, a study by the ORGANIZATION1 has shown that there are roughly PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings than just DATE1. This is alarming because at that rate people MONTH1 never get to know each other and the world MONTH1 become an electronically based workspace. Finally PERSON1, social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they cant feel the emotion a person has when heshe is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a persons words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. To begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. Also, average people get PERCENT3 fewer workouts, according to CAPS4s CAPS5, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. Finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over NUM2 in the past ten DATE1. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the worlds currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. This technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. In addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. So, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better place to live.",0
"Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way should not be aloud to be showed to the public. If these offensive things were not aloud to be showed I personally think it would help out are country is full of racist people and documents.      Everytime you pick up a magazine or you watch a television show about a famous actress or musician you see embarrassing aspects of their lives all over the world. This is not right at all! People should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in there life. If it wasn't for actress and musicians we wouldn't have any television shows to watch. There would be no use to have radio's. There would be no reason to, their would be nobody to sing songs for us. Why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways? They work their tails off to produce new things for us.     Books in the libraries should not have sexual assualts in them at all. Books like this in school libraries have no reason to be there. Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school? Expecially foul language in materials at school. Books at the library should have good examples in them not vaulgar sayings. This is a disgrace to the school.      Movies are a big concern. Any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted. Would you want your child brining home a movie that had nudity in the film? I remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from are local library. This movie was a total disgrace to this library it had nudity, foul language, and lots of violence. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. My library would have something like this in the library? Children go there and pick movies out. My mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films. She said that the movies should be seprate from the rest. You should have to be a certain age to rent this movie. Or atleast have a parents permission.     Every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community. Lets keep are children and young adults away from violence. By allowing this in are school libraries and local libraries it is just saying it's ok to letting this violence in. We should put a stop to it and prevote good attitudes. So please take the violence off the shelf",0
"In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the ton is happy and loving. In this memoir there are many examples about how the tone is loving, and happy, but heres a few. First in paragraph NUM1 there + two phrases in parenthesees that show how CAPS1 loved the things like the music and the cooking of his home, and family. ""(and for which I am eternally greatful)."" And, ""(which I adore to this day)."" CAPS1 wouldn't have added the use things in unless CAPS1 truly meant it, and if CAPS1 really loved his home. Also what sets the tone is how CAPS1 talks about loving his parents, and how CAPS1 is grateful for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" CAPS1 states in the first sentence of paragraph NUM2. Lastly, the last sentence of the memoir is happy and puts a smile on your face after you read it, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

"The CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3  The beautiful flames danced so peacefully in the CAPS1 air. The faint shimmer of the blaze was the only light we had. As I stared at the majestic destruction of the warm, humid air, I felt someone or something watching me from behind. The weight of the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy as I walked from one side of the house to the other. Finally, I reached the trailer just to be told by PERSON4, my best friends mom, the she didn't think we would need that much wood. I thought to myself the this was going to be a long weekend. After about two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows, and tents we headed out for ORGANIZATION1. It would be about two hours of driving, that felt like twenty minutes. PERSON3, PERSON1, PERSON2, PERSON4, and I were the worst group of people to put into one car. We all yell and fight and punch at each other just for fun. Once we arrived at our destination, we sprung out of the car like a hive of angry bees. I race PERSON2 to the ORGANIZATION1. the second we were done unpacking our belongings. The first few days were spent basking in the one hundred degree heat, swimming, and flirting with the random girls we found around the camp site. We slept as little as possible, so that we could enjoy the friendship and just pure fun we were having. During day two, we decided to go mountain biking. We were on those bikes for hours before we noticed the sun was going down. In the moment we all turned and saw the most extravagant view the earth has ever created. There were burst of orange and red. The colors ricochet from cloud to cloud. After hours of riding our bikes in the heat, we chose to go for a swim. As we swam I felt something touching my foot. Then all of a sudden there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was only a stick. As I looked closer, it turned out to be a root system of a fallen tree. It looked fake, as if someone or something had put it there. This though sparked a conversation about CAPS2 for the day to come.  The sparks danced together as if they were CAPS4 and the LOCATION1. The only light we had was the brilliant glow of the fire. PERSON3 was playing a gorgeous melody on his guitar. As I listened and enjoyed the flawlessness of nature, I felt someone watching me from behind. I nudged PERSON3 and when we turned around, our hearts stopped. There was a spinning green light, almost twenty feet in the air. I spoke the word everyone was dreading, CAPS2. I had slowly stood up and the light started spinning faster. I quickly grabbed the machete, that was next to me, and approached the light. As I grew closer, I could make out small figured in the CAPS1 shadows. Then, an eruption of children laughing came booming from the direction of the light. A little boy emerged, unable to control is laughter, and ran away. After returning to my seat next to the camp fire, I thought about life. What if CAPS2 were real and they are watching us. No, there not real. I laughed it off, and continued my week long vacation.",0

"What if you're family all and to talk to them percent of people commucate online, and thats not a bad thing. Heres the thing, are you for or against kidsparents online for too long. I am all for this. Reasons being are lots of kids have friends that they talk to online, secondly kids have homeworkprojects that they might have to look up online, and my last reason for this is, some family might have CAPS1 ect, so they can communicate online. My first reason for this is, a lot of kids have friends online that can't text or even talk on the phone, so this is another easier way to talk to them. Did you know that most kids communicate online now. ""I think the internet is a great things, I mean I would rather have my kids online than outside roaring the and getting into troupe."" CAPS2 ORGANIZATION1. NUM1 of NUM2 kids are online communicating with others. Without a doubt, kids bring home projects and homework everyday right? Wouldn't you rather your kid looking up information online, then have them guessing and getting it wrong? I know that alot of children don't have computers, internet or essy, or maybe their got allowed online. That's why they. I remember the times when I had a project due at school, and I guessed on. that didn't do my grade any good. So then I decided the next time I have a project to do it on the internet. And it worked, I got a much better grade then I did on the one I guessed on. Lastly, mostly everybody has on the internet and would live to and with them while. So even stay online too often your not on it for a bad reason, your on to talk to your family."" CAPS3 I got internet in my house, I barly ever got to talk to my family. But just then, my son me to get one, and I have the chance to talk to my family everyday. CAPS2 a recent of a computer. Some people do say on the computer for too long at times, and don't get out on exercise the amount a humane should. or they don't get out of the house as much as they used to CAPS3 they got the internet. Yes but, it's a good cause, it's not like because forever. Also it's being used for good. Not for anything bad. I think the internet is a great thing, and it puts a effect on many people. Reasons are, kids have friends online to talk too, ""lots of that needs internet, and last of people have family online to talk to so it's now or get out there and your best pick. The issue grapple with is if you for or against internet acess! So get out there, and change now.",0
"I think that computers effect people in a positive way. Computers increases our knowlage, lets us communicate with our friends and family, teaches us hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. Computers are enjoyable, great pieces of technology. Even though sitting down looking at your computer screen is not very interactive, computers increase our knowlage. Computers have all these websites that are full of great information. You can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want. Going to the library for a book on your report would consume extra time. Instead you can look up the facts you need online. Computers also let us communicate with family and friends. Calling someone or sending a letter costs money, but sending on email to someone does not. Many people have family and friends that live far away from them. Through computers they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense. You can also see each other through a webcam. Which you can attach to your computer if it has not have in one allready. Another reason why computers are useful is because they help with hand-eye coordination. Computers require you to type, which is a great skill. While working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring you can type up the essay on you computer. Typing takes to get good at but is very helpful. Finally Computers help us get our news foster. When major things happen, such as the earthquake in LOCATION1 it was all over the internet before the news. In conclusion computers are very useful and help us increase our knowlage, communicate with people, help us with hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. But most importantly computers are fun!",0

"Laughter: A CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 of the variety of emotions expressed by humans, there are emotions that represent different qualities. While furrowed brows MONTH1 be associated with displeasure, anger, or even confusion, laughter is an action connotative to mainly one emotion - happiness. Although emotions are relative aspects of human nature, actions such as laughter exist to transcribe an emotion like happiness into physiological expressions that humans are able to understand. Due to this unique quality as an action, laughter is often a key element in developing relationships. Over the years, I have found that laughter is crucial because of three various reasons - laughter does not separate, it is an ability that all members of the human race have in common, and additionally, it brings down personal barriers. In many aspects, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""; instances of laughter are CAPS1 anecdotes. Unlike sentiments such as jealousy, fury, or sorrow, happiness is an emotion that tends not to separate. While jealousy, fury, and sorrow can cause such discontentment between people to the point of physically and emotionally driving them apart from each other, happiness does no such thing. Happiness is conducive to laughter, and because of this, laughter congregates people together, rather than dispelling them apart.  In addition to its compelling nature, laughter is also a CAPS1 action. In a general view, laughter gives humans another point at which they are equal; the ability to laugh is one quality humans share. Even infants, in their states of vulnerable dependency, are able to emit laughter. Laughter is also able to establish starting points for new relationships, because sharing a laugh is akin to establishing commonalities between people. Whether the commonality be a sense of humor, similar experiences, or a surprise, sharing a laugh automatically institutes a link between two or more people. Additionally, while laughter can begin new relationships, it can also solidify them. Often, as laughter is shared through common experiences, having common experiences to laugh about symbolizes a relationship between people in itself. Since laughter is mainly about relationships and interactions between people, it is also about building trust. Establishing connections between one person and another, regardless of how weak the connection might be, requires some form of trust. Laughter is often able to bring down emotional barriers because it requires a sense of kinship and camaraderie. Through laughter, we as humans are able to bring down notions of suspicion or anxiety. As stated before, laughter establishes commonalities and therefore is an activity that exudes a sense of trust and reliability. This razing of emotional barriers is another way in which laughter is able to bring people closer together.  Laughter is a CAPS1 action that ""personifies"" how similar members of the human race are. It is astounding how man is able to discern qualities such as reliability and trustworthiness simply through the complex, yet basic, act of sharing a laugh. Through laughter, people are subconsciously able to make emotional connections with their fellow human entities and in doing so, are able to take interaction to an emotional level. Laughter is the true story behind human relationships worldwide. Not only is laughter the CAPS1 language, laughter's intimate nature renders it the shortest distance between two people.",0
"Ambitious for its time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was doomed from the start.  The engineers and builders of the mooring mast were faced with many obstacles that could potentially inhibit safe docking at the top of the building. The first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock. As described in paragraph NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""  Modifications would have to be made to the entire building.  Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building.  As described in paragraph NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible.  These obstacles, baffled engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was abandoned entirely.",0

Some are happy moods because they have each other. There are grateful mood because of all that Narciso's parents did for him. There are stressed moods because his parents don't get the jobs they deserve. There are calm moods to show the contentness he had in his home. There are relaxed moods to explain the feelings he had for his life and there was even harsh moods to show the tough times they went through and such.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was an issue for the builders. The dirigibles made outside of the United States were used with hydrogen. This became a safety issue because ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". On top of the building, the wind is always shifting because of ""violent air currents"". The shifting winds would be a problem because they would cause the end of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low of urban areas""; making it illegal to dock the dirigibles. The builders also feared that the high winds could ""blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"", causing danger to the city. There are many obstacles the builders faced that made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building.",0
"you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever many people in remote ribes and areas dont even know theres been a man on the meon. Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes, insurance, credit cards and othe payments which is good so if you cant get of your house or the place is closed you wont get late fees and it can even help you save large amounts of money too. Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online website such as CAPS1, twitter and myspace were you can talk veiw pictures and see what friends are up to. Also on CAPS2 you can message friends too. Further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time. you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too. The biggest reasons that computers are benifit though is that they revolutionized school now for homework instead of doing a work sheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher. Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and home work much more easyer, redrable and it ean give you a much more broader view of the topic. By far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos. Therefore it is much easier to learn and under stand thing wich will help us in the future be successful. Also many kids pay less attention when a teaches is giving a lecture but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students attention much better. These are all the reasons why I think the computer is a excellant invention and every family and school should own one I hope you will find my CAPS3 very persuading and puplish it.",0
"Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and weight as well as length of the dirigible were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that the dirigible, which was made to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mass. and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in DATE1 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough. Another issue with safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (NUM1 ft) held by single cable would add stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to modify the frame. These obstacles plus many more showed that that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose.""",0
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the Empire State buildings past construction which led it to be the tallest building in the United States. Although the buider Al Smith had many obstacles, they faced of the hardest one when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles is allowing dirigibles to anchor their for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Another obstacle is letting dirigibles dock because of they need a place to tie up to a mast. It is stated, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which haulled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast"" (Lüsted NUM1) This can be a problem because the body of the mast could swing in alot of breeze. Although there were many obstacles Al Smith worked his way around them and procceded to finish the Empire State building with corage to take on all obstacles.",0

The next obstacle they faced was nature and its winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents,"" (NUM2). The winds would be a major problem that the builders would have to face because it is so unpredictable. Lastly, the builders had to worry about the law pertaining to airships flying too low over urban areas ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" (NUM3). The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the difficulties of safety, nature, and the law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.",0
"Would you like to discover new things and explore amazing mysteries around the world? Do you love to have friends overseas? Do you want to relax and do something fun after ORGANIZATION1? Advanced technology today allows you to do almost everything that would have been considered impossible DATE1 decades DATE1. We need to decide whether computers have positive or negative effect on people. I firmly believe computers gives society many benefits and opportunities. Who would disagree that computers are devoted to educational purposes? Computer experts have invented countless programs that make ORGANIZATION1 easier for kids. For example, CAPS1 helps you with essays and reports. With her program teachers wouldn't hurt their eyes trying to read sloppy hand written compositions from students ORGANIZATION2 helps you organize and calculate, ORGANIZATION3 gives you the ORGANIZATION3 to create dynamic presentations. Many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their ORGANIZATION1 tasks. ORGANIZATION1 has also aquired convenient-sized laptops to help students do their projects and take test. That saves a lot of paper and a lot of trees! Furthermore, many colleges offer their courses online. You can obtain a college degree right at your house without going anywhere. Education has never been so easy, thanks to our advanced network and computers. It is very important to mention the entertainment benefits of computers. I have notices many teens play cool games on the net. They seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity. It in an ideal way to relax after a stressful way getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs. Some websites after downloadable songs for free so you don't need to worry about the financial part. Moreover you can watch movies online anytime, form wide section such as horror, romance, comedy, fantasy or even children films. No more movie tickets, no more driving in the theater. Without a doubt computers can put a single on everyone's face with its entertainment benefits. Many people feel that computers both kids and adults always from their social life, but actually, computers give them a chance to communicate with other people around the world. Ten DATE1 DATE1, who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with same one a thousand miles DATE1, with no mail or telephone or whats over? I came to the LOCATION1 DATE1. I am extremely grateful to computers because I can keep in touch with my friends and relatives. I can just send them pictures of the snowy winter sceneries here through just a minute. How much easier could it get? computers definitely improve communication and brings people closer. Let's not wait any longer. Computers have endless positive effects and should be popularizeas. They help you learn have fun and communicate with people faraway. Above and beyond all that new technology makes the earth a greener place by saving paper and trees.

"I believe that all the uncensored books, movies, music, and magazines in a library should be taken off the shelves and put into a single room in the library and be labeled as the CAPS1 CAPS2.     The children that go into the library at most libraries have a space where its just kids books but when the kids go with their parents or someone that is older up to the teenager and CAPS1 CAPS2 they dont know what they are looking at when they just pick up a random book off of the shelf andor rack.      Some people MONTH1 think that it shouldn't be like that because they are weary of who might see them go into a little room marked CAPS1 CAPS2. However, if you don't want anyone to see you go into that room you just simply don't go in it.      So by secluding the CAPS1 books, magazines, videos, etc. you can keep the children from just picking up any book that has uncensored pictures or grabbing a video that the parents MONTH1 not look at and end up being an CAPS1 film and then the kid then might want to keep seeing the stuff like that when he reaches puberty he will be eager to have sexual entercourse with a boygirl.      Having said that, i hope that you see how my idea of sectioning off the CAPS1 stuff will keep them out of the CAPS1 stuff and keep them from having sexual entercourse at as early of an age as thirteen.     As far as music goes, there really isn't a way to completely keep kids from listening to music such as rap that has foul language and it sometimes talks about having sex and drugs and the kids think that the artist who wrote the song made it to be a big shot and they did drugs and had sex and look how they turned out. The best way, in my eyes, to keep kids from listening to rap is for their parents to not let them listen to it while they are with them. However, the other music like CAPS5 CAPS6 and CAPS7 or even hip-hop rarely has any references to the topics of rap music.      I could also argue that parents should watch out for their kids to be aware of the consequences of some of the actions they take due to these reasons and they should take the action of diciplining the kids for their actions",0
"In my experience some music is just too offensive.  They use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages. Even the magazines have things that are just way too inappropriate for some people.  Some of the movies they put out these days are just horrifying to see.  The fact that they put these things in a library shocks me greatly.     One day I was babysitting a little girl and I had taken her to the library.  There was a CAPS1 on a shelf and she put it in her CAPS1 player.  It  was making very sexual references and had many curse words in it.  I was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age.  As soon as I put my ear to her head phones, I turned it off immediately. They should really watch CAPS4 music they put put out to the public because if I hadn't of been with her, she might have picked up on some of those words.  I don't think CAPS3 would want anyone listening to that kind of language at any age really. It disciminates woman and gives young children ideas in their heads of sexual activities.     One other thing they put out in libraries i don't agree with is magazines that are a little too mature.  I went to the library one day with a friend of mine and i picked up a ORGANIZATION1 magazine.  I was flipping around and I saw all these revealing pictures and I was thinking to myself, 'CAPS4 if a yooung cjild picked up this magazine when no one was looking?' That would be a horrible experience for a young child to have.     I've read somewhere that things children see at a young age, have a great effect on who they will become.  If this is true I certainly thing we should censor CAPS4 we out out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library.  We should make sure the next generation doesn't see certain things that we have.  We should also monitor the movies the watch and keep a close eye on the things they read",0

"asking if the readers were for or against technology. I support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive ammounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs. With a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. I read an article in the CAPS4 CAPS3 about a man who was participating in a church program in which a foreign citizan would come to LOCATION2 for a while to make friends and learn about the LOCATION1. This man, PERSON1, was assigned a from the farms of CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. PERSON1 thought CAPS13 would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunatley, he knew nothing about CAPS6. he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home. When the woman stepped into his door, CAPS8 was eastastic to feel like CAPS8 was home again. CAPS8 ended up staying with PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer. CAPS8 might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Also, PERSON2 from ORGANIZATION2 says that language students such as spanish and french have PERCENT1 higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A. but the average grade for kids CAPS15 a computer is a CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and succes in the future. Computer also save a massive ammount of time. In the school Newspaper, PERSON6 told about her homework problem. ""CAPS10 night i had CAPS11 homework. I had vocals CAPS8 is a galore to deal with. I had to look up CAPS10 word in the huge dictionary, I was failing CAPS11 because i just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer, CAPS13 was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in NUM1 minutes compared to NUM2 hours! I was finally doing well in CAPS11."" CAPS15 her computer, PERSON6 would have to have and CAPS11 NUM2. CAPS8 would have just kept failing CAPS15 her time-saving computer. ALso, PERSON3 says that PERCENT2 of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening in the radio. He says that PERCENT3 of people get a because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing. As you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save. Finally, computer allow one to talk online. A student once had the misfortune to break one of his vertabrae. The doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a. The student, PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teacher bad interacted with him over the computer. CAPS15 his computer, PERSON5 would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming. Also, PERSON4 of ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationshops after college. Obviously, being able to talk to some are over the computer is a useful thing to have. In conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. Not only does CAPS13 allow people to learn about places other than their home, CAPS13 also gives us more time and allow us to talk to other withour ever leaving the comfort on home. I recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer.",0

"Shut down libraries?     Yes, I do, because music, movies, etc. could not only contain unnessisarry attire, they could also contain potty mouth language.  The words could, and can, corupt the minds of youngsters.  All librairies put them there because of the needs of customers.  The things they do to make some cash around here, do you agree with me?     They should create seperate libraries for each type of reader.  Still, they put all of these things in the same building.  They should put up sales for kids' movies not adults, but the librarians say 'books are books'.  I think I'll write my own CAPS1 sieries, thank you very much.     However, because some have dull enviornments, or lack of customers, some libraries close down.  Make use of that thought I just told you.  I wonder if some books on endangered species of fish.  But some kid's sieries are dieing of because of more popular ones, or being replaced by some family stories.     If a little kid were to listen to some cursing, hisher mind will be warped for life.  What chic-cursing out loud in front of the baby.  How about saying 'CAPS2 CAPS3 that?..' or 'CAPS4 that ball, you meanie!'?  Maybe THAT will give some education.     However, some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young mind-maybe even before they learn good language.  Those dilenguents don't care about their minds at all.

"In libraries there are some books,music,magaizines that are not very apporiate to put on shelves. There are little kids that will want to look at anything they can get their hands on. They are very mysterious when it comes to that.      There are bad books but there are also good books in the library. If people found a book or any type of material in the library and found it offensive, then they should take it off the shelf. There are children that look at anything they want or what they think looks interesting. The library also should at least check what the book is about when it arrives at the library. That way no one would have to worry about a material being offensive. Movies should not matter really because there are a lot of bad movies but i dont think that people would find them offensive. They dont have to watch it and neither do their children.      There is a lot of bad music. I think there should be censorship on music because some music today is about drugs,alchoal, and violance. People would not want to see that in their local library for their children to see. I have seen on the news people get upset when they see something that they think is inappropiate for underage children. I would get mad too because i dont want an underage child to be listening to that type of music. Children now look up to these song writers and want to become them. That is not a good thing at all.      All magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is. Libraries would not put a inappropiate magazine on the shelves. There are some magazines that they have but they are good magazines even for children to read. I think that the libraries dont put offensive magazines out because they dont want any controversy. People today have came out even more good magazines for anyone to read that is not inappropaite for anyone.      I think some people today dont realize that the library would want to offend anyone by putting those offensive magaizines,movies,books and music. Putting censorship on those things would be a good thing because there are materials that are not good for small children to read or hear or watch.

"Do you think that some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive to people? This is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another. For some, it just depends on your age, your beliefs, and if you actually know if it is offensive in the first place. In my opinion, I think that the offensive materials should be taken off the shelves.      First of all, I think a lot of it depends on your age. For, example, most older people think that most of the material made today is just crazy and do not want anyhting to do with them. Although, for the younger people, thet is what is new and 'cool' to do. I do not believe that anything bad or offensive should be shown to any little kids. We want to keep it away from them so that in the future, they know not to use it. In my own experience, my parents kept me away from all of the bad stuff for the most part. I think it has affected me a lot today on who I am today.      Next, I think for some people, it depends on their beleifs. A big thing with this is race and culture. I often find books, movies, or magazines offending another race. This the the thing that I find most disturbing about some materials. Anything offending another race or culture should be taken off the shelves immediately in my opinion. There are countless numbers of these materials just theat I have seen and I am sure that there are many more. It MONTH1 be impossible to ever get every single one of these off the shelves.      Lastly, I think that a lot of people do not know that what they are going to read, watch, or listen to, is going to end up being offensive. I have seen a countless number of movies and listen to a countless number of songs that were offensive. The sad thing is, I did not know it before I did it. A lot of people just go into their material as blind as a bat, as far as knowing if it is offensive goes. I think that if the material is not taken off of the shelves, then it should at least be marked as offensive.      All in all, I think that the material should just simply be taken off of the shelves. We have gotten to the point where there is so much out there that it is nearly impossible to do. Even though there are factors like age, beliefs, and knowing what you are going into, I think these materials are just bad for everyone. In my opinion, offensive materials should be taken off of the shelves",0

"'Can I read this?'  CAPS1 a round the world have asked this or been asked this question. CAPS1 have their own right to read what they want, but are the childern alound to? There are books that children or young adult should read and should not read. This MONTH1 vary for it depends on age, and the way the reader will understand the content of the books. There are cursing, smut and CAPS4 in books that for children should not read.     In highschool there are some books like 'CAPS2 and CAPS3' that has cursing in it. For highschoolers of NUM1 or older will be alright to read. Highschoolers understand and has heard these words more than once before. If a teacher gives this book to a NUM2 grader they would not understand the full potential it hold for the learning of it. Childern in that age range will not understand that the man is handicaped, then the childern would not understand the killing the handicaped man had done or why his friend killed him after it.      Will a parent let a NUM3 year old read a smut novel? This depend on the way the parent was raised and how the feel it will effect the childs development. An PERSON1 book would not be approprent for a child of that age for the child does not, and will not understand the book it self. The book is more then just that one part of smut. There is a gothic and romanic was of writing to PERSON1 books. A child of NUM3 years old would not have developed the mature way of think of the book.      CAPS4! 'CAPS4 is not the answer.' Everyone has heard this saying. This say is said but its not followed. Young adults play video games, read books in school related to CAPS4. 'ORGANIZATION1's don't CAPS5' is a book of a colored teenagers going to a white school. This is a book giving the kids to see how things were. A child in elematenry would think its funny if a cartoon is played for them and someone gets hit. The children will is it a game and do not have enough background or maturity to under stand what is really happening and that it is wrong to do that. For just watching a tv show with hit or punch the child will think it is ok to do it.     Over all there will be CAPS4, cursing and smut novels out there. The thing it depends on the parents and maturity level of the personchild. There is a wrong and right way to do it but for CAPS1 it not right to let some underage read a curse, voilents, or smut",0

In CAPS4 opinion, I feel that this invention MONTH1 be is taking a negetive toll on society. I say this because now-a-days there are inappropriate websites that children should veiw, and it takes away time with family. But mainly because of the recent CAPS3 issue. Without a doubt, youngsters such as are expertly and a website, we'll just do as we were told and on maybe we could find one by an accident. Who knows? All I know is, there too many to count adult websites that children from the ages of DATE1 log on to everyday. This is unacceptable on a person why we should be prohibited in computers. No responsible parent would be caught dead with a NUM1 year old on an adult website and computers make it harder such parents to do so.

Now it's your chance, I hope you will feel the same way as me when it comes to the negetives and positives of computers.

"Have you ever got or check out a book or something that has been racial to you or you think it should have been censored? I haven't but I checked out a book before that had a lot of racism in it and sex. Im not racist but some people are very racist. Some of the book in libraries aren't sutible for some viewers but yet again the can check it out, some books, movies, magazings, and others should be taking in consideration on being removed so some viewers can't read them.     In libraries there are book that have alot of racism in them. Some racism gets to be very bad in the book and it could intrest and provoke the young viewer to go down that road in a later life. Which could be very bad if you think about it. He could talk his friends into becoming what he is. talk them into becoming racist towards others. No mother or father wants their kids to be racist, but there are familys that are racist. Which i don't get because we are all the same to me.      In some books in the library there is sex talk that accores in it. Sometimes the sex talk gets into great detail which isn't sutible for young viewers, because they could get the idea that they want to try that with someone of a different genger. Which is okay if ur older but if ur really young and reading a book with sex talk in it. Well that's wrong because young kids shouldn't be introduced to that kind of life stile till later in life. Some parents wouldn't like their kids to read that kind of book. I know I won't let me kid read a book like that.      Music is something that everyone listens to, no matter is its rap, country, or the blues. Certain people like certain kind of music. Some people think that rap music is offensive and should be removed off the shelves. Well rap music is based on their past and how their life is. It does have some racism in it like certian rappers say bad words that aren't really sutible for young viewers.      Although some of the racism and cencorship that should be cencored are on shelves, I think it should be in a separete room so only older people can check it out or buy it, instead of the young kids getting a hold of it. I believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past",0

"During the construction of the Empire State Building's dirigible dock there were three major obstacles: the wind, the structure, and the safety. The wind was the most obvious flaw in the landing dock because of the rough wind currents at the top of the building. Landing perfectly on the dock was one thing, but staying there was impossible because you would have been whipped around. ""[ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles] feared that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings of the area, which would puncture the shell."" (paragraph NUM1)The problem of structuring the mast to hold the balloon would also become a structural obstical because ""[they] couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph NUM2) To get the structure sound enough to land a dirigible they would have to do sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framework.Lastly, landing a huge metal balloon ontop of the largest skyscraper, over millions of citydwellers, even when they knew the balloons were highly flamable, was one of the reasons the mooring mast didn't work out. Although there were two attempts of landing, neither succeeded, and now the mast is there only for decoration.",0
"There was three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. First, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Since the dock would be above downtown New York, there is a higher risk of the dock blowing up due to the density. Secondly, nature was a great obstacle. There were many winds on top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently, there was a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around and hitting another building. Finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law of airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigible would not be safe, and the entire idea will drop. For these reasons or obstacles, many builders of the Empire state building faced while attempting to allow blimps to dock there.",0

"The invention of the computer has made a great impact on society today. Although many people would look upon computers on a negative note, the computer allows us to do essential task needed in everyday life. Many people feel that the applications on a computer are CAPS1 keeps us away from doing other productive activities, but the applications a computer holds is neccessary for must tasks. Apps suchn as  the calculater saves time from doing all the work on a piece of paper. It allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than NUM1 seconds. Its a great for finding how much a tip is, financial reasons such as now much you have to save, or even dung same basic math or science homework. Another great application is note taking that can easily be typed. This application allows you to take notes by typing, which again eliminates the need to write with a pencil or a paper. Note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz. The most important and must commonly used application on a computer device is the internet. The internet has over millions of websites for many reasons. If you plan to go to the movies tonight, the internet will surely give you movie times, directions, and how long the movie will be. It is also a great way to plan family trip or to book flights and such. Considering this, the apps are very useful. The computer is also a great device to use for learning. It allows you to look online about new subjects such as far away places or people CAPS1 would our country be line if we were not educated on the outside world around us? It is also a great learning technique for research. Our teachers today gives us many projects and assignments to learn about new things, and CAPS1 a great way to research our topic than on the computer.

"I dont believe that it should matter what books are in a library. If you think a book would be offensive to you, dont read it. If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself. Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention.      If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would help a lot, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others. I honestly have not seen a CAPS1 in a school library, but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it. And if there isnt one, its probly because someone complained about it.     If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want. Theres all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it. I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things. Like I said before, if you dont like it, dont read it",0
"Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive? PERSON1 states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of. What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual. Different people find different topics offensive. No two people think the same.     Though certain books or magazines MONTH1 have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgable on why some people think the way they do. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now.     If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out. The library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh. Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not.     People have their own opinions and views on materials. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truely enjoy it. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more sensored rather than tolerated.  If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library?",0
"While building the Empire State building, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The original problem was figuring out how to get the dirigible onto the building. After consulting with the Navy as well as meeting with the president of newly formed ""airship transport company."" After this they thought they were past the rough of it, but there were many obstacles to come. Next, as they began constructing the mass, they realised with the height of the building, dirigibles landing would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The frame of the building would have to be modified to help fix this problems, and it cost over MONEY1 to make these modifications. The prior two obstacles had been resolved, but the next bunch of obstacles caused the attempt, of dirigibles to dock, to stop in its tracks. Many safety problems posed as obstacles for the building team. It could be very dangerous, as some gases used in dirigibles are extremely flameable. Another obstacle is the ability to safely dock, at such high altitudes, with ""constantly shifting"" air currents. All of these problems were amplified because it was even more unsafe for these problems to exist in such a populated area. The build team was able to overcome some obstacles, but some caused too many potential problems to be fixed.",0
"I understand how some people MONTH1 get offended by some things they MONTH1 watch or they might read but that doesn't mean that other people shouldn't be able to know about it because one person doesn't like it. It's kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not.      I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for. On just about every movie or music album that is produced they rate it so that you can know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't. If the movie was made with somekind of offensive parts to it then they put with the rating that yes, their is some rude language and things like that. So just because somebody didn't read close enough to see that their might be something they don't like in the movie shouldn't cause everyone else to not be able to see that particular movie.     Personally I don't find books to be the greatest things but I am sure of that some books or magazines do tend to have something rude or crude in them but it's not always horrible. If someone thinks that the book MONTH1 be inapproiate for some readers then they could tell a person in charge in the library that maybe they should only be letting certain people be reading that book because of the content. You shouldn't have to throw a book off a shelf because one or two people thought bad about it.     If it was me choosing whether or not to take movies, books, magazines, etc off of the shelfs I wouldn't. I say this because PERCENT1 of the time things have been rated or in someway approved to be put on general store shelfs. People can simply read details on the back and see that it's not going to bother them in a way or that it could be offensive and they shouldn't be purchasing. If someone complained about a new cd or movie that I personally wanted to see or listen to and it was taken off shelfs I would be upset about it because it probley wouldn't even offened me at all. So no, i completely disagree with the idea of movies or books and music having to stop sales because two or three people were offended by it's content",0

"Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them. Others do not. For me I dont.     I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves because there are different types for different types of people. If a person took offense from a book or magazine I believe that person should just put it back. If books that offended people couldn't be on the shelves there would be no books on the shelves because I'm sure there's atleast one person in the world that would take offense to each book. There are o lot of people in the world after all.      For music there's different types also. There's rap, country, rock, pop and many more. For example if someone likes rap but not country that person has a choice to listen to rap and not country. If that person doesn't like country though it shouldn't be removed because others MONTH1 like country and want to listen to it.     For movies there are many different types. There's horror, comedy, romance and many more. That's why at the theater there's different rooms for different movies. People always have a choice.     Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them although some don't. Every person is different. People like different things. That is, in my opinion, the beauty of human nature",0
"Computers are good for school uses, skills, and just for fun. Computers are a good source to have, now that is just my opinion. But, I think computers are mostly for pre-teens and teenagers. Adults mostly use them for business. The fun uses that the computer provides are CAPS1, CAPS2, CAPS3, etc. CAPS1 is one of the most popular chat groups on the internet, CAPS2 is another popular chat group. They both have some of the same characteristics like chatting to your friends, updating your status every now and then uploading pictures, songs, etc. There are websites that could be used for free time like music websites where you are allowed to watch music videos or downlosd music onto your ipod. CAPS3 is a website teenagers of kids go on to watch some of their favorite music videos. Itunes is the program where you can download any song, music video, tv show, or movie onto and ipod. Computers also provide microsoft CAPS5, publicher, powerpoint, etc. All these can be used for school purposs. CAPS5 allows you to type up anything you want for school. You can type up a NUM1 page essay if you wish. You can cut and paste pictures for a project you might have due. You can change the colors, font size, and font style on CAPS5. That use could be for a design on the front of a cover page for an essay or project. Publisher can be used for projects as well. In school of you need to make a newspaper, flyers, business cards, etc. publisher alloews you to make them. Powerpoint is a program where you can make different slides in anything. Computers can be put to good use for many different things. If people don't agree with that then they don't understand that computers help children and adults with everyday things. Some kids who have special needs MONTH1 need the computer to comunicate with others. Computer, I think, are a big help in the world.",0

"Censorship in Libraries      I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In DATE1's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things. There are somethings kids just should not see. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive.      Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction. Odds are, if a kid sees his role model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking. This has happened to me before. I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact. If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model.     Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it. A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing. I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head. This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies.      Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then his parents will not have to worry too much about him going off and doing bad things because he sees his peers do it. This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life.      Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. I say this from experience. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. Well I am sort of considered that smart kid. I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used.      In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have.",0

"The builders of the ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the beginning preparation., The builders thought it would be a great idea to let dirigibles (also known as blimps) to dock there. They didn't take into account the obstacles and struggles that they would soon face. The builder's didn't take into account the wind pressure and what the stress of the blimp's load would do to the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundered feet below."" This was a huge problem the architects and over MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. ""Safety was also another big issue."" Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a fire had broken out over a highly populated area such as downtown New York, the results could have been disastrous. The winds also were problem. Even if the blimp was tied down to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around and could result in a dangerous accident. There was also laws against low flying ships. The architects For the Empire State Building should have thought it through.",0

"To CAPS1 CAPS2 MONTH1 CAPS3:     I am writing to you today concerning cencorship in libraries.  I have had a select few instances throughout my life where I have read a book or magazine that to some MONTH1 seem offensive and to others not at all.  However, I do have my own view point on the situation and I feel that CAPS2 is my duty to inform you that I feel offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves.     Everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them. They stand for these values, but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do.  With the world the way CAPS2 is now, violence can errupt from the simplest of things.  Putting books on public shelves for the public to read, can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions.  Offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result.     My suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books.  This will create a safe and happy envioronment for all who visit public libraries,and other public places.  CAPS2 will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents behaviors.  Children follow in their parents' footsteps.  Observing bad behaviors from the parents due to offensive books does not teach the child how to act in a responsible way if they were put in this postion.  When our children grow up, we want them to beahve in a responsible way.  Offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior.     As a student, I want to grow up in a world that has people who are resepectful, happy, and responsible. I want people to get along with each other.  I feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world I would like to live in.  Violence can be created through anything, and I feel that offensive books should be the last thing added to that.  Without offensive books for the public to read, will create a better environment for the people living today.",0

"Do you think computers benifit us? I think they do. There are many way computers do and don't benifit us are a lot more use full then the way they don't. Like kids in school use an online text books. Also a lot of company's have websites so we can see what there about before we choose them for the job. We also use computers to look up directions to places we want to go so we don't get lost. School kids benifit from computers a lot because they would have to carry home tons of books but instead they just go on the computer to get the online book instead of carrying home NUM1 really heavy books. I know I like to go on the computer better then carrying really heavy books home. Also when you look for a home decorator you just go on the computer and look up websites to see some of the work they have done. It helps out a lot becase than you don't have to figure of the hard way that the decorator is not good and end up spending a lot of money on a room you don't like. Also if you are looking for a job you can look up there website on the computer and avail them to see if you can get an interview rather then wasting your nature going there. I also use the computer to look up ways to get some where and it's a lot easier to do that then to start driving and get lost I know they have gps's now but they cost a lot more then some on a computer you can find out. I still think computers benifit us in many ways. Like using an online text book instead of carrying your huge textbooks home.

"The obstacle the builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles or ""blimps"" to dock on the Empire State Building were nature itself. The reason nature is the obstacle for blimps to dock on the building is because the wind currents moving the end of the blimp. If the blimp is moving by the wind while passangers are leaving or getting in, it would be very easy to fall off. Another obstacle the builders had with docking the blimps is the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. Those weights were used to keep the blimp from shifting directions due to the wind currents but it was a concern for the safety of the Street Pedestrians. On CAPS1 NUM1 of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it quotes that ""... that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe"". This quote proves that putting weights on the back of the blimp would be dangerous. If they some how fall off then someone could get really hurt on the streets.",0
"When you think of a book do you think happy kids books, or mysterious dark books? What if I was to say offensive books? Most magazines, music, books, and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you MONTH1 think.      When I think of a movie I want to watch I think of something that im going to injoy; not something im going to shut off in the middle of it.

"We all find things offensive, wether it be in a book, magazine, movie, cd, tv show, or a newspaper article. Libraries hold all of those items and somepeople MONTH1 or MONTH1 not want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right? If everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left.      Maybe writers should just cut down on things that are innapropriate, racist, or things that include foul language. Then not as many people would be offended and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own. Although, it MONTH1 not be the writers at fault here. It MONTH1 be the readers. Some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading.     Yes most adult things now are innapropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies. And parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the childrens section. All types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that. If parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about the reading or watching something they should not be. That is what parents are for, taking care of their children and some people do not do a very good job of that.     If there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age. And maybe then it would be ok of they read it, because they are old enough to realize right from wrong. Parents can not always control what their children do. And if they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they MONTH1 see it in a different way than their mother of father did and they MONTH1 learn a very valuable lesson from it.",0

"Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor",0

How can your music get banned in the land of the free. I think that there should be no way that any thing can banned in a liberary there should be no such thing.

So dont censor it still have it just make it where you got to be a certain age to see that movie from a liberary. There should be no sensorship in the land of free speech. How would we be call the land of the free if we are censoring everything. That is why i dont think we should censor anything in LOCATION1.,0
"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¶NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there.",0

"While building the Empire State Building, workers faced many obstactles while attempting for dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible attached to the mast and building would add extra stress, so builders instead had to over sixty thousand dollars worth of reconstructions to fix the buldings framework. Dirigibles also dock with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast, and while they planned for the blimp to be able to sway in the wind, it was unrealistic that any ship could attach to the building at the high winds.Other obstacles they faced in letting dirigibles dock the building, was because of the safety hazards, the hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. is highly flammable. Builders also did not take into consideration the pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas, so it was illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. The task of having dirigibles attach to the Empire State building was an impossible task to begin with.",0
"Knowledge CAPS1     CAPS2 you ever remove something that be misconstrued as offensive to someone, although you don't believe it is? Neither CAPS2 I, and I dont believe libraries should either. Removing books, movies, magazines, and music from libraries is unconstitutional, and it seems to lean toward controling how people think, known as communism. Also anything can be found offensive by one party of people, and so everything CAPS2 be offensive, and removed. Then libraries CAPS2 cease to exist. What about in the court room? If one side of the story is not told, how will the jury be able to tell if the accused is guilty or innocent? Taking out certain 'offensive' learning materials CAPS2 leave people in a bored mindless state of mind.     Do you want the government controling what you think? I didn't think so. In the LOCATION1, modern day LOCATION2, PERSON1 did just that. He decided exactaly what went in and out of peoples minds. He did this by desiding what they could read, write, and listen to. That sounds like things you can get at the library, right? We can't have the government controling what we think, and mostly all libraries are government run. If we let them deside what we read and listen to, thats the first step in losing our freedom, and nobody wants to lose their freedom.     Lets say a white man goes into a library and looks at a book about racism, and how it has helped the nation. Then, at the same time, an CAPS3 CAPS4 women goes into the same library and gets a book on why women are better than men. Then they see each other, and the woman wants the mans book banned, and the man wants the womans book banned, and both the books are removed. Then neither party is happy, because both of their books are gone. The point is, anything can be found offensive, if you just glance at it, or look at it to much. Plus if everything can be found offensive, and all of the offencive materials get removed, then all the books and learning materials are gone. Noone is left happy.     If you are being tried for murdering someone, and the lawyer of the defendent gets to say their piece to makes it look like you are a murderer, and you don't get to defend yourself, what are you going to do? Your going to go to jail, most likly an innocent person, and your marked as a murderer the rest of your life, all because your side of the story wasn't heard. That is unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional. If we let this happen to our libraries, half the books will be sentinced to 'death,' without a 'fair trial.'     So, if you want to have an un-CAPS4, communist, and unfair library system, that is your choice, but I believe that the way we do things now is just fine. No book should be banned because of its material, because noone, except the writer knows exactally what it means. People get to read what they want to read, and don't have to read what they don't want to read. Thats what the freedom we have is, you have a right to read, watch, and listen to whatever you want, and nobody can stop you. Do you want that to change? I know your awnser; it's a no",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public.",0

"The cyclist in the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to CAPS1 national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with dipleted water, CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again.",0

"The mood created CAPS1 the author in the memoir is a positive and grateful mood for his home, and his parents. One example of the mood created CAPS1 the author is in paragraph NUM1 when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

Another example of the mood of the story, is in paragraph NUM2 when the auther states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" A final example of the mood created CAPS1 the author, is when in paragraph NUM3 he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

"yahoo, ORGANIZATION1 or gmail. For instance we could meet someone from LOCATION1 and learn about his or hers culture or beliveths.

"I firmly believe that people do spend a lot of time on computers, alot of teens spend alot of time on computers, I also think this from my own experience and I surveyed PERSON1's NUM1 grade CAPS4 class. I would first like to expand my idea of teens spend alot of time on the computer, some teens go on the internet and do homework or might check their emails others go on CAPS1 for hours and got addicted, so they're not outside or doing sports. In my own experience I used to have a CAPS1 and I woud be at it for the whole day and I woud miss out on hanging with my family and friends. So I deleted the account. But, I still feel addicted to the computer I'm always listening to music or chating with my friends or checking my emails like most people The things* And lastly else to PERSON1's NUM1 grade CAPS4 class, PERCENT1 of people a day on it, PERCENT2 said that they spend PERCENT3 of people. That they now go on the computer. These that just one NUM1 grade class most students are addicted to it.* no matter what age. This is why I believe that people do spend to much time or the. Many students go on CAPS1 for hours at a time and in my own experience I have been addicted to the comp. and PERSON1's NUM1 grade CAPS4 class when I surveyed them there ans a very high percentage of people that said they were addicted to the computer.

"CAPS1 computers have really change the way people use technology. It has made our society different in many ways. People can look at information faster than ever with this device. People can also talk to friends, especially on popular websites, computers are even used in school, mostly in college. CAPS1 an advantage of using it in school, means so much to the people and there education, computers have changed the human race forever. When my grandparents went to school, they had no idea what a computer was. their guide was priar knowledge, knowledge from a teacher, or a dictionary. We are so fortunate today to have even computers in our school because my grandparents would have loved to have something as quick and as simple as a computer. CAPS1 access to a computer can really help people inso many different ways, mainly about the world. What is the first place you would go to talk to people online: CAPS2. Do you man NUM1 out of NUM2 people have CAPS2. The reason why it is so popular paper want to talk to friends that they enjoy talking too. From my experience out from canada have CAPS2 too, which is surprising. Talking to in country is unbelievable. As you're opportunity for people to make new friend. This can also affect the way people lively. When teenagers attend high school, they have a choice of talking a specific, almost like a helping one classes is because when you are in college, so many in a short amount. I have people who stay up for our their paper. CAPS1 these are an advantage for everyday life, especially college because it is an oppurtunity for someone to get better at typing computer classes can really help someone trying to learn how to type at a fast pace, and get a caple more hours of sleep! In conclusion, I believe CAPS1 computers effect our society in a positive way. Thank your for reading this letter, and I hope you can take this into consideration. CAPS1 computers have dramatically changed lives forever.",0

"Laughter? What is laughter? Well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( CAPS1 speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up. Here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid. My CAPS5 has five days of laughter as I call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, LOCATION2, the DATE1 of DATE1, CAPS2 , and CAPS3. On my birthday the whole CAPS5 gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world. Usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade. Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  When LOCATION2 finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my CAPS5 meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find. Which we always seem to miss at least one every year. While we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again. When we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them. Then watching him try to climb down again. When that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek. Which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot. On the DATE1 every one has their own agenda that they fallow. My dad and me go to LOCATION1, ORGANIZATION1 to light CAPS6 on the third of DATE1 for CAPS4 CAPS5 CAPS6. While waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so. Then on the DATE1 my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.  Then comes my favorite laughing day CAPS2. My dad sets up his house as a haunted house. Which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources. When we go trick or treating I am usually a solider with a CAPS8 gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though I am right beside them. Later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, I usually win because I get to stay out later than my siblings do. Well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays CAPS3! a time of gift giving and receiving. mostly receiving for me. We all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when I am cooking. After every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest. Then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again. Its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. So that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell. That is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. Like a saying my grandparents used to say to us kids when we were sad ""A laugh a day will keep the CAPS10 at LOCATION1"".",0
The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become almost familiar now that is when she starts to see that her new life in the LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.,0
"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is calm and they are happy. I think this because they talk mainly about the good thing in their childhood. They also say how much they loved thier family. If you don't love or have a family as a child you would not be happ and they were. My last reason is they were most grateful for their home and how their parent turned a house into a home. This is why I think the authors mood is happy and calm.",0
"In winter Hibiscus the author uses hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adapting to a new life, and Saeng's home country at the end of the story I think that the author realizes that even though she failed the test, everything is going to be okay. While looking at the hibiscus she remembers her old life, which she loved, and she is reminded of the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower. In life, I think every one should always remember that even though one MONTH1 be disappointed at sometime, we have to keep in mind, the fact that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good.",0
"Libraries are a place for everyone; from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages. When you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it. From personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right? Well some libraries want to take that concept away.      A library has books on nearly all subjects. That is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library. Someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion. If a strict CAPS1 would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended. That situation could go both ways though. Because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature.      Most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections. There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault. The mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area.          With different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things. Some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. One book to one person could mean something totally different to another. It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. Libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area.      Books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people. Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book. Whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs. With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? Taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives.      A library is a place of knowlegde. It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. Wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech? Just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. If people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom?       A library is a place for everyone. It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. A libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books. Taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. A library should be a place of balance. A place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read",0
"CAPS2 would you want people to be on a computer all day doing nothing? How would you feel if no one was out getting excrise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks and beachs. Everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers. When you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing, just sitting around, CAPS2 would a computer solve that problem? It really CAPS4't. This is what I would say to having computers, People spend to much time on computers, excrise is needed, everyday, and it makes your body wear and your eyes strained. When it comes to computers everyone wants to get one, but when we say excrise it seems like peoples mind click off. This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers during a long period of the day, CAPS5 head home to spend more time on the computer, CAPS5 whats that doing to your body? not helping it. I like computers to and I like spending time on them, when i need to get something done sometime that doesn't happen, because I get and I forget what time it is and that's not fun. Sometime this happens to people they are engaged in there computer, when someone is talking to them and your telling them something you need them to do, and there noding there head like they know what you sayed, but the next time you asked if it got done and it didn't, you know they were listening. Excrise is really important for your body and doens't even have to be to got anything, but don't spend your time wasted on computers. This happens to NUM1 to NUM2 or families when they come home from work or school, and jump right on the computers, families are not getting enough excrise or spending time with family because computers get in the way of that. Excrise would help to keep you instead of electronics. Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body, it sucks the life cut of you. It strains your eyes it makes you wrat and you really dont want to do a lot, maybe if people spend less time on computers and more time being more focused on families and nature, they CAPS4't be weak and tired. I know a lot of people who CAPS4't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodys more focused, from my experience computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real life it helps for really no one. i hope you understand CAPS2 I say these sort of things, but if you do care about health and activities CAPS5 you would say that computers are not a lot of help also.",0
"In a pole conducted by the ORGANIZATION2 (CAPS1) PERCENT1 ORGANIZATION1 people agreed that computers are a easier way to research than going to a library.

Today in america over PERCENT2 ORGANIZATION1 all people own a computer, according to the ORGANIZATION1 are most definatly a benifit to today's socity for the reasons that it allows better and easier world comunications, makes text and information, more redily avalible to the public and allows the advancements in technology that are nessesary. Communication is a vital part ORGANIZATION1 america and the world in this day and age. Communication is souly run by the commputer. CAPS3 computers provide better and faster communication.

"I do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive. The way i look at it is, is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights their own opinions. Not everyone is going to think alike.     As an example some people are against blacks and others are not. Everyone thinks different and have their own opinions therefore, they should all be able to listen to whatever.

"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the one obstacle to thier expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, also saw a opportunity for his Empire State Building to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, or to let passengers off and on. Also dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. In conclusion, these are the obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced, to allow dirigibles to be docked.",0

"Laughter is a CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4 have been there, I know CAPS4 have. We all have. CAPS4 have been that kid that just did not feel like helping your nagging parent out. Especially when your dad had been in a huge motorcycle wreck and CAPS4 had been waiting on him hand and foot the entire visit there.CAPS10 had gone through a couple of surgeries and was put on a lot of medications for CAPS2. I had noticed CAPS10 was not really himself on all these pills. His abnormality was taking a toll on the family. Through all these stressful times, we were also worried about CAPS6 stepmother. She was pregnant with her second child. There was also stress of having CAPS6 fathers business being the main income, and him not being able to work. CAPS6 father felt helpless, his leg was to weak for him to be doing anything.CAPS10 would micromanage everything, and tell CAPS4 were doing things all wrong. The was starting to cause a lot of tension within the house.  Today was the day. Isabelle (CAPS6 little sister) and I were left alone with CAPS6 with dad for the first time.I was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we were doing in CAPS6 room. Father asked asked if I could make him some oatmeal, of course with full hands I said ""CAPS5, but I will when I'm done."" CAPS6 father took that as disrespect, and hobbled over to me with his crutches. CAPS10 was yelling at me which was upsetting, so instead of fighting back i headed to CAPS6 room.The anger in his voice was excruciating. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and headed back to CAPS6 room. That's when it happened. CAPS6 father hooked the end of a little kids chair and flung it down the hallway. It bounced off the walls, breaking an outlet shell, putting a hole in the wall, and hitting CAPS6 knee. I didn't say anything, being afraid of what would happen next. Slamming the door luckily I had the phone and I called CAPS6 grandmother. I told her on a voice mail that I wanted her to pick me up and take me to her house. She showed up an hour or so later not knowing I left a voice mail. I explained what happened, and she comforted CAPS6 sister and I telling us it would be okay. CAPS6 grandmother sat us all in the living room to try and resolve the situation. By then CAPS6 dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. CAPS10 used popcorn and candy to make us forgive him, then CAPS10 started making fun, and jokes. Every time there is a fight or disagreeing CAPS6 dad always cracks a few jokes to get us in a better mood. The one thing different this time is after CAPS10 told some jokes, CAPS10 apologized again. This time explaining why CAPS10 was sorry. I liked that which made the rest of the day quite a joy.  "" CAPS7 made laughter to be a CAPS1 CAPS2 medicine, NUM1 minutes of laughter is equal to two hours of CAPS2 CAPS3."" CAPS8 CAPS9 on a DATE1 service talked about this. Laughter can truly mend a broken heart. The CAPS2 that CAPS6 sister an I went through that day was all over after the laughter CAPS6 father gave us. ""Laughter can save us."" CAPS10 also stated. After this day I believe with a little humor CAPS6 father an I's relationship can get through anything. I would never let one mistake control a life time bond. Laughter will always be in our hearts.",0
"CAPS2 CAPS1, CAPS2-CAPS1, CAPS2-CAPS1! The sound ratling through CAPS11 cars. All  I can think about is after CAPS6 and lunch. I grow more impatient as the clock ticks and CAPS11 heart throbs. I do not like the meap for that reason. During the reading selection all I think is, âCAPS7 has to be the most boring story in history âthen I turn the page, CAPS8, CAPS7 one is, âCAPS9 makes me so impatient. All I wanna do is finish the test. Little beams of sweat read CAPS9 slow but I do not want to be the last to turn CAPS9 in. In the writing I think âCAPS10 am I going to write about?â CAPS11 hand starts to ache, and CAPS11 head will pound because of everyones pencil running as if CAPS9 were in a horror film. CAPS2-CAPS1, scribble-scribble, eek-eek, bom, bom, then you have to read over and over, make sure you have a title and read hand writing. The most nerves working of all, is the math segment. There are question I forgot. All the math teachers seem to cram all of CAPS9 in CAPS11 head at once. CAPS9 is absolutely terrifying. Then while your testing, there is someone who can sit still and their desk starts rattleing. Well, if anyone could not tell, one, I am very impatient and two, I do not like the meap. CAPS2-CAPS1 is the most annoying sound. Along with many others, I am trying to get a good score. CAPS2- CAPS1, little, beams of sweat, libom bom, eek, eek scribble- scribble.",0
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to make the reader want more. When an author ends the chapter of a story or an episode of a show it is always a good idea to use a cliffhanger to drag the audience along. In many stories have read this is used. In my CAPS1, the PERSON1 book it always ends with a cliff-hanger. Like in the end of the third book one of the soldiers is killed but you dont find out by who until the next book.",0
I would have to say that the reason that the narrator ended with this is because it is kind of a solution if you think about it. And you dont put the solution any whereelse but the end that is why she put it there.,0

It says, Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. It also says, I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist.",0
I think computers help people out because you can learn about at here thing like CAPS1 you want a job you can look it up in the computers. Also CAPS1 you have a problem they will help you out. CAPS1 you what to go some where you could go and be on the computer and look how it is and CAPS1 you like it you could go CAPS1 not look some where else you what to go. I think it a great thing CAPS1 you look for people in the computer because you could talk to them and see them it realy cool. You can look for coltures in your computer what you want to learn. Like CAPS1 you have a favert person you what to know about you can look it up in the computer and she videos or you can look up different sites it really cool. There games you can play online there alot of game and fun game learning games. Math game science game different games you what. Also you can us othere people that are planing the game game as you. It realy cool. I think the computer isn't bad for people computer help them a lot.,0
"The mood the CAPS1 creats in the memoir is a mixture. In reading the story you feel happy, and greatfull, this is because the CAPS1 is stating how great her family and friends were, along with how great her life was. She also states that you dont need alot of money or a big house to be happy. In paragraph NUM1 she says ""I will always be greatfull to my parets for their love and sacrifice."" This says to me, that very happy and she very greatfull to have parents like she does and that she would never want to loose them. She also states in paragraph NUM1 ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity..."" To me, everyone should be this gratfull to their family and loved ones because you never know when you're going to loose one",0
"I believe that people should not be able to remove books, movies, magazines, etc. from shelfs of the libraires. If someone takes a movie, book or magazine offensive they should contact the auother of the pieace and can complain or give their thoughts. Even if someone does find someones work in a wrong way, people have their own opionons and thoughts about everthing in life and are allowed to voice their bellifs and disbeilfs. Also, people can read on the front or back of other peoples work which summarize what the work is going to be about or what the work is talking about. People can decide then if the would like to read or watch further into it. Everyone in this country is allowed to say what they think and if someone takes the time to get their voice published then others might want to hear what others think. People can disagree, no one has to agree with anything anyone says. It is alright to not agree with another person says but everyone does have the right to stand up and say what they think about the situation. For example if my coaches were to tell me that they think im doing something wrong in gymnastics or they think something doesn't look good when I do, I let them speak. I let them tell me what they think would look better or would give more points. Then after they're done talking I give my thoughts and say 'CAPS1 I think this because this' I try to reason with them. For one its more respectful and for two everyone can have their own thought about something. And who knows they actually might be right if you give them a chance to speak. But, if you really don't like what another pieace of work might say you can always not read what they wrote, or watch what they produced. There is no need to be rude. If you strongly diagree you can always write your own book or publish an article voicing your own thoughts, that way someone can diagree or agree with how you feel about a certain subject. That is why I feel that they should keep all books, magaiznes, movies on shelfs. Everyone is allowed to express themselves and explain their actions toward a certain matter.                                                                      Sincerly,                                                                         PERSON1",0
"To whom it MONTH1 concern: I think computers have a great effect on people. Computers are useful for homework, it allows you to keep in touch with out of state family, you can also look up direction and information to a place. Computers are good for last minute situations. Computers are very useful for homework because when you type a report it looks more professial. While you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time. In some cases there are people who write very slappy to a paint where he or she cannot read his own writing nor can a teacher. A sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat. If a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home. If you are a parent at home busy with kids and need to do work; there's no need to go anywhere stay home and use your computer. If a child is absent from school you can go to the school's website and find out the homework. Do you have out of state family you wish to talk to? If so wouldn't you want to be a able to talk to them without a expensive phonebill? A majority of people would say yes. Using the computer to keep touch with family is not so expensive at all! Some examples are aim, emails, and other networks and they don't cast money at all its free. When there's a day you have nothing to do, don't you just want to go somewhere for fun? Don't you want to do something just to get out of the house? Well if there's a last minute decision or situation the computers there to help. Before you go somewhere and you want know a little more go on the computers. Not only will you get information on the place you can also get directions. Now you can go somewhere instead of staying home bored. In conclusion, computers do have a great effect on people. It can be useful to both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students averages easier and faster and children can do their homework efficiently. You can also keep in touch with friends. Overall computers are useful.",0

"Saeng vowed to herself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again she will take the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes hope to saeng that things can work out a second try. She concludes the story with the vow because, it expresses her last bit of hope. For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, with new surroundings but it also explains how she feels. She vows to show she won't give up despite of falling the first time. For example, Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense , it was almost visceral (Ho). This quote explains what the plant meant to her. This is why she concluded the story with a vow.",0
"Newspaper, I feel that the use of computers is no big deal. it is a convienient way to communicate, it teaches young adults and adults social and life skills, and is no different than other addictions. These three reasons are why I feel the ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated. My firsty reason why I feel that the ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated is that some people think that less time is spend with family, but I talk to family, and friends everytime on the ORGANIZATION1. It is a conveinient, fast, and for the most part safe way of communicating. When I need help with something, I sit at the ORGANIZATION1 and fb chat someone, or if their not on, I e-mail them. I get my answer within a day. Also you can look up the answer online, the internet is a beautifully smart device. Also if you call someone versus chating on the ORGANIZATION1 you MONTH1 have no idea who they are, it is also much easier to trace a call then trace a ORGANIZATION1 to a certain location. Communication is faster, safer, and more conveinient over the ORGANIZATION1. My second reason for being NUM1 is that it can help teach said and life skills. For example, did you know that on average, an adult will make MONEY1 more if they know how to type good, and fast? The ORGANIZATION1 serves many functions. Facebook, for example, is a social network, amny young adults can learn basic social skills by having a facebook. Social skills play a very important role when you are finding a job for the first time. If you have good social skills, your boss MONTH1 like, and apreciate you more. Which can only lead to a promotion! Computers are very nifly to have around! my third, and final reason, for believing, with all respect, that NUM2 people are blinded, is that people don't easily get addicted to the ORGANIZATION1. It is very hard to become addicted to the ORGANIZATION1. Only about PERCENT3 of facebook users are addicted. Compared to an alcohol addiction, about PERCENT1, or drug addiction, PERCENT2, ORGANIZATION1 addiction is microscopic, and not to mention, not deadly. The only similarity between the ORGANIZATION1, and other deadlier addictions is that they are addicted, and MONTH1 become grumpy if asked to stop. ""ORGANIZATION1 addiction can be cured with a speedy recovery, and as long as you are on for an hour or less a day, there is nothing to worry about"" says PERSON1, at the NUM3.) CAPS1 there you have it, computers use is not a major problem. It is a conveinent communication device, an effective way to learn social, and life skills, and is no huge major source of addiction. CAPS1 there is nothing to worry about. Sit back and look it up on the internet if you don't believe me.",0
"All things in the world are not strictly black and white. Every person is different, with varying ideas. So when some people are certain that a specific word or topic should be restricted, there will always be another person to say the exact opposite. Sometimes, what's found as 'vulgar' can only be introduced with the intent of education. Also, this ties in with something our country was founded on, which is freedom of the speech, and the press.      Magazines, music, books and movies are mainly for entertainment. Everyone who reads or watches something will take it in differently, and it will have a varying effect. Let's say there is a NUM1-year-old girl who just had her first day of high school. While at lunch, she slipped and dropped her tray of food. Later that day while she's alone reading her favorite magazine, she's reading an article about embarrassing stories, where one girl accidentally walked into a boys' restroom. Some parents MONTH1 deem this inappropriate, but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation.      It's human to mess up and act crazy; we aren't perfect by nature. So when we see errors made into comedies and dramas by any form of media, it's human to realize that we aren't the only ones who undergo these events. To censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens. Not to say that a novel written about brutal murder that contains sexual references should be given to a little kid, but it should not be pulled from the shelf all together.      The topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one, especially with younger kids. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to remove a book that they thought was not suitable, then eventually there would be nothing left. Many parents are uneasy with the thought of their child being taught things like sexual education, but on the other hand, there are also the parents who appreciate it. They do so not because it saves them time, but because certain explicit topics - to an extent - can help someone mature if it's done in a controlled environment.      Years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media. It could range from saying 'intercourse' to replace 'sex' or it could be something like extreme propoganda. There's a reason that our consitution protects freedom of speech. No matter how appauling someone MONTH1 find a topic, it usually has some type of informative purpose. Otherwise, it probably wouldn't have gotten issued.      Choosing what is and isn't offensive is a matter of opinion. As previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and their opinions won't be either. So this means that if one person out of a group is allowed to dispose of or censor whatever they find necessary, it must be recognized that some portion of the remaining people will be unsatisfied. This is usually where people will claim that the law protects their freedom of speech. In the end, the media is largely for entertainment. It provides numerous shows and articles, with a huge array of topics. This goes to show that if one should find something offensive, it doesn't mean they have to rip it off the shelves and complain; it simply means they have the opportunity look elsewhere",0
"Libraries are very educational. They provide books, movies, magazines, music, and computers for you to locate something you are looking for. I dont think that libraries include anything offensive. If anyone finds anything that a library has that is offensive to them, then they should talk to someone who works there and see if they can come to a solution. It shouldnt be removed because not everyone MONTH1 find it offensive.          I've been to many libraries in my life and personally, it's amazing all the books, and things for you do there. I've actually gained alot of knowledge at the libraries i've been to because i found so many books that were just amazing. Never, have i ran into something that was offensive to me or anyone else. Everyone is different though, we have all have a different view on things and we all are unique. If a library does have something that's offensive to everyone then maybe it should be removed but like i said earlier if it's not offensive to everyone then it shouldnt be removed.           I personally, think libraries hold so many unique things that if somethings were offensive to people then i'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed. If someone came up to me and said 'hey, i find this music to be very inappropriate for young children to listen to' i would say, 'well, that MONTH1 be true, but some children do listen to that music, it wouldnt be fair to remove it, just because one person doesn't like it. Now, from my experience theres alot of things that people find offensive but personally, i think it would be outside of a library",0
"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez was happy and thankful. His parents taught him many things about their cuban back ground, like cooking and music. His parents gave up many things to comfort Narciso and make him at home. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents turned their house into a home for other People as well. ""My parents always kept their Arms and door open to the many people we considered family."" Narciso's parents would take in anybody that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Narciso's parents were very loving to the community and help out as much as the could in making that place at home.",0
"Computers are they a good benifit for society or a bad benifit for society? What do you think would you enjoy always being on the computer? I wouldn't, so this is why I believe that computers have a negative impact on society. First reason why I think computers have a negative impact is because you can become addicted to always having to be on the computer. Becoming addicted to the computer leads to serious consequences. For example you spend less time exercising and that isn't healthy for your body physically. Not exercising leads to many things like being over weight, health problems, diseases like dieabeties, and many other things, but usually these are the main problems. You can aviode this by turning of the computer and just go for a small walk, but because of what computers have to offer now these day people want do this. Thats one reason why computers have a negative impact on the society. Another reason for why computers have a negative impact on society is because you won't spend as much time with your friends and family. Even if you don't know this if you spend more time on the computer than with your family and friends this affects them in many ways. They can feel dissapointed worried about you, even concerned. When you are always on the computer you're ignoring your family and this hurts them emotionally. Think about how would you feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with. You two did everthing together, and the all of a sudden your best friend suddenly stops calling you; or visiting you and hanging out with you. You would feel dissapointed because you loss your best friend over a computer. These things can happen if you go overboard when using the computer. This is why is think computers don't do good they do more harm in my personal opinion. The final reason why I say that computers aren't way good is for a main reason safty. Those days computers have all the websites like CAPS1, CAPS2, twitter, and others. There are so many kids who chat with people they don't even know. Also they're posting pictures of themselves without even thinking that this is a dangerous thing to do. Once you post those pictures they will always be there no matter if you even try to delete them. Another thing when you're on the computer people don't even think about their safty and thats how things happen. For example you can think you're talking to a friend but as it turns out you were talking to some stranger. Then you go meet up with your friend when it really wasn't. So you see safty is a real big problem with these computers. That's why I believe computers have a really negative impact on society. As a result, do you still believe that computers are a good beifit for society or bad beifit? My opinion stillis the same and I'm sure that there are others who believe the same. So this is why I think that computers are a bad benifit for society, and that computers can lead to more harm than do any good for people who use the computer.",0
"The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was it would have to be really safe. To hold the aircraft down they would have to use lead weights. I weights fell from the top of the building in such a dense, populated area it would be very dangerous. Also when the owners of the Empire State got notice of the hindenburg blowing up they felt uneasy. Even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building the wind would whip it around making it even more unsafe. The idea was good but not probable to be safe.",0
"While they were attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith thought if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, then the dirigibles would be able to anchor there to refuel and let passengers off and on.Another obstacle that was faced was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium which was extremely flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building felt that it wouldn't be safe if the dirigible set on fire with a densely populated area right below it.The greatest obstacle that was faced was the use of the mooring mast with nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The owners of the Empire State building believed that if something went wrong then the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. This was very unsafe.",0

"ORGANIZATION1 on the excerpt from The Mooring mast by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted there were many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obsticle the builders faced was safety. Paragraph NUM1 states, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how horrible an accident could be if it takes place in a highly populated area.         The greatest obsticle the builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents"" paragraph NUM2 states. They could have weighted it down with lead weights, but using these where they would be hanging above pedestrians was not safe.     The last obsticle the builder faced was the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for any ship to dock at the ORGANIZATION1 on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there were many obsticles builders faced to allow dirigibles to dock there""",0

There are books that talk about black people in a bad manner, but they still need to be out there so that people will know. Libraries are out to make money thats all. Let them make money, they can sell whatever they want.      If I had a library I would sell just about anything i could. people will: watch, listen, read anything. So why not sell it or rent it out.

"CAPS3 are you? As for me I am fine. I am writing this letter to explain to you why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons why I am writing this letter is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places, computers helps you leran more about different parts of the world and also computers helps people understand and learn more about life. That's why I believe you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. First of all why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places. An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families different places. And they cannot have a good contack with them. But if they go on the internet they could their friends and families and chat with them. This shows that if you live in the LOCATION2 and you have a friends that live in LOCATION1 you could have a with I have families that lives and LOCATION1 and it is hard to them. But when I am on the computer I can chat with them and have a fun time. This shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world. An example is that if you don't know anything about a country or a place you could go on the internet a research and learn more about that place. This shows that computers is important to have. Another example is that when I have a project or a essay and I don't know about it. I could go on the computer and look it up. And by doing this it will help me on my project or essay. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Finally why I believe so is that computers helps you understand and learn more about life. An example is that if you don't know if something is right or wrong you could look it up and it MONTH1 help you. This shows that computers can give advices. Another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do. If you are trying a new resipie and you are not sure on CAPS3 to make it. And it will give you the inderigant and direction to make that food or snack you want. That's why I believe that you and all others should believe that computers have a positive effects. In conclusion why you should believe that computers have a positive effect is that people could contack with friends and families, computers helps you learn about different parts of the world, and also computers helps you learn and understand more about life. I would hope you read and reread this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people. That's why you should believe that computers have positive effect on people.",0

Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town. The unplanned that the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph since he barely had any water he was going 12 mph. This tells me, hes troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because it all desert seem light it became the author is slowly loosing hope on the travels further and further.

He was riding in??? the and then the sun started beating down on him and he said it felt like the desert, considering it was so hot. The road was fine at first and than he get a while down the had and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on. The part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time. All are reasons why the cyclist shouldnt have taken directions in the first place.",0
"Im not a very patient person. I always whine and complain. If patient means you stay somewhere for a whole without complaining, then I guess there are some times when Ive been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me busy. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about NUM1 hours. My friend PERSON1 was there, and we hung out together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didnt complaine once. Then we got yelled at and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasnt too bad. that was one of the few times Ive been  patient, and dont know if it counts since I was with somebody.",0
"The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists.",0

This shows his love for his kitchen. PERSON2 shows his love for cooking when he writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and un wittingly passed on to me their rich culinory skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today.""

"In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. Not two miles into the next section. He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It get harder and harder to continue his ride.",0

She didnt want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that author is trying to adapt.",0
"Computers our town are very important for instance. For all of the banks we have computers and for almost every job. We need computers for life, and that doesn'CAPS1 make use lazy and forget full it makes us busy. The only situation with someone who is online being lazy is with a teenager playing games. But the only reason some kids do that is because they all dont want to go and exercise or run around with their family who they see everyday. But because they want to talk to their friends make plans and just talk while they play togeather. If someone is ignoring their family or becomeing more lazy, it is because that is their choice to sit around and do nothing. And I do agree that people are becomeing over weight but I think that is because some people consider a workout to be an hour of lifting and running once a week. And that isn'CAPS1 right. I think that this news paper should post up adds about gyms and maybe that will lower the faty meter in our town. or if they think people are neglecting their families have people work less so they can go home and see their families. As for teens I think you parents out there need to set some rules like NUM1 hours of play a day, NUM2 hours on a DATE1, and if they don'CAPS1 listen take the game away for a day of two, but that might not get them to spend time with you because they MONTH1 be mad, but it will get them outside or atleast doing somehting more active and not watching CAPS1.V. or playing video games all day. Also I know this from expieriance becouse I am a teanager and I always go outside and run around when my parents take my games away, and it's PERSON1 that of homeworld. Please take my advise and your happy caring family will always stay togeather and active and not always sitting on the computer stressing over work and playing videos games.",0
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable, if it caught fire above a city, the results would be diasastrous. Another obstacle was that at such a hieght,  the winds would blow the back of the dirigible around. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that airships could not fly below a certain hieght over cities. All of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible",0
"The mood is shown and explained in several ways throughout the memoir. The mood of this short story is happiness and of a sense of family. The first example of this mood is in paragraph NUM1 when the CAPS1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" PERSON1 is showing that just because someone is not related to another person they cannot be family. Another example of the mood of the excerpt is when is when Narciso says ""My parents always kept to their arms and door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The CAPS1 is showing that people who love each other like family have each other's backs, no matter what. A final example is when the CAPS1 states ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned about how to love."" The CAPS1 is saying he is greatful for the people who showed him what ""family"" really is. In closing this story shows true family and how a house becomes a home.",0
"The setting really afeted the cyclist alot.The sun and hot weather dehidrated him. He also had pretty much ran out of water. In the story he says ""The bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water. Then it says ""the growing relization that I could drop from a leaf stroke"" shows the heat was affecting him.",0
The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is going to start over and do better the second time around because she doesnt want to disappoint herself. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.,0
"The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much.",0
"The builders faced so many obstacles to dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One of the greatest obstacle's was nature itself, like winds on top of the building was shifting due to dangerious air currents. The back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The dirigibles would be dangling high above pedetrians on the streets, was neither practical nor safe. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There were so many obstacles to moor dirigibles on the Empire State Building.",0
"Do I think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries? Of course not, there supprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country. Just because some people MONTH1 find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody.     Think of some authors that wrote books like PERSON1, although there were alot of racist remarks in literature of that time period. That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absoulutely nothing is what, racist people arent going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now.     Music and movies are forms of expression aswell, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it. You do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature.     People just take everything so literally these days, they got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should reallize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all. That they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news.",0
"Computers are intresting peices of technology to work with at home or at work. Some people might think that computers are a waste of time. Also might not be useful. Or that the computers dont have anyway of helping you. Other people think that the computer is very helpful. People should be happy about the computer invention. What do you think about it? Your wasting your time on the computers! Thats what you hear your parents say all the time right. Well, kids dont really wastes their time if they are on the compter because they could be writing up a paper for a class. They might be playing on educational game on the computers. Even if they arent playing a game or writing up a paper. It is still making them learn some thing. Some people might say that computers are useless, but that is not true. When you are writing a paper for an CAPS1 class. You would want a computer to help. It has a keyborad so it gose faster when you type. Instead of writing the word out. It also has a grammer check. That is to help you spell the words out correctly. This is why a computer is a useful thing to use. Computers dont make things go faster. But yet they do. They help you find information about many things on the internet. Also if you had to look up a person for a school project. I think you would find more things about that person that you would in books. It really close make things go faster. Computers do help you. There not a waste of time. They are useful to every one. They also help things go faster.",0
"The author used ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because its resembling that her mother is refreshing, waking, and restoring its self. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happens. She was really sad she failed. I  I failed the test She seemed to be embarrassed + sad. So that last paragraph does a good job describing what Saeng is going to do. She is going to look on the bright side of things and restore her self to come back and pass the test",0
Almost all of the cyclists surroundings are old and barren. Hot CAPS1 like weather. The road is hard to ride on. Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills. So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one.,0
The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.,0
"The mood created by the author in the memoir are pretty good. The author shows that he really does appreciate his parents and thanks them for everything they've done. He calls his home a warm home. He remembers the inocence of childhood, congregation of family, friends, and endless celebrations. He states that he had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.

Well I'm someone who does because they can talk to there family and friends on sites like facebook, myspace, & aim. They can also exercise on the internet because if they go to youtube, then they can find different types of positions that they can do. Today, over NUM1 people use computers and it is like PERCENT1 adults anfd PERCENT2 children use computers which means that more kids today are doing athletic sports. The adults use computers for there work ability and in schools. At newspaper places, they need to have a computer just to type the daily papers and if there's no compers, then how ill the type there work. As people get home from wherever, and they didn't get the daily paper, the you can go online and look at it. For students, computers are so important to us because we get to talk to our friends and when we need to look up something, we just go to the internet. In some schools, they have really big books for different classes that they need to bring home. And that's bad for your back, so then schools came out with the books online. For those people who love sports, you can look up you favorite team and see if they won that weeks game. There is also vertual sport games that you can play for that is on the computer.

This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.",0
The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map.

"Computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people. Computers can teach people about things that are forien to them. Computers keep people intouch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are asigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definately a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for comunication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as CAPS1, facebook, myspace, and twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see whats to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it werent for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer. Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shaped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper. Why bother to go aginst them when they benafit society so much? Computers are helping the world become a better educated, connected, and informed world.",0
"Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book? Many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas. When people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries. I think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it.     Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books would go against what our country stands for. How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read?      Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book. I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing ,and offensive but that doesnt give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves. Censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem.     I believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society. There are many people who MONTH1 actually want to read a book but never get chance just because it is censored from library. Books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination. Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity?",0
"The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because its a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life.",0

They also said that on being on the computer has taking more teens ORGANIZATION1 the streets and in their homes. Dr. ORGANIZATION1 has done extensive research and has proven that being on the computer teaches you hand-eye cordination. Another thing he has proven is since computers has been invented the violence rate has gone down because more people spend time at home on their computers rather than out on the streets. He also proven that since people have started schools the success in school grades has gone way up. He thinks they have gone up because, instead ORGANIZATION1 students reading long boring article on someone or something they can just search it on the internet. He said using the internet also saves more time. My mother syas when she was younger the computer gave her the ability to learn about far away places.

"To me I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. To explain it could mean new begining or starting over.

"In the excerpt ""The Mooring CAPS1"", by: Marcia Amidon CAPS2 the builders of the empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose due to many reasons and many obstacles. One of those many reason was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Furthermore the biggest obstacle to the sucessful use of morning mast was nature itself. Due to the reason that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe. The other obstacles was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building for the entire idea was dropped. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hard obstacles.",0
"Should certain materials be removed from our library shelves just because it has uncensored materials inside of it? My opinion is no, actually heck no! Now don't get me wrong, but I'm not the type of person that likes reading materials like that all the time, but every once in a while there is a really good book or magazine I would like to read that is uncensored. The bad thing is that  I am told I cannot just because it says something or shows a picture of something a teenager supposidly shouldn't be seeing.      One of my main questions on this material is why are they allowed to show statues of the early roman times in our history books but not materials we hear and see on a daily bases? Half of the time the statues are of a naked person. I don't see why that is allowed but other materials about our times are not. We are in the time period were people are open that it doesn't bother them to see that stuff. Yes, some materials are not suited for teenagers my age, but honestly I hear offensive things all the time when I walk through the halls in my high school.      Someone MONTH1 have an opinion about how the material is offensive, but if its so offisive why do they bother even complaining or thinking about it. Yes, everyone has a right to their own opinion, but thats there opinion and that doesn't make them always right. That person can have there opinion but other people have opinions that might oppose the other persons opinion. Does that make them wrong? You will never know because everyone has there own and who knows whose opinion is right.      Another statement I would like to just throw out there is that we teenagers are learning to make our own decisions because in the near future we are going to be adults and have to make those choices on our own. So, just let us choose if we would like to read material with uncensored things in it. It is our choice, why can't we just choose it without people telling us we cannot.      I still do not see why it is such a big deal of reading uncensored material. Why can't they just allow the materials in our libraries. Don't make any decisions for us because we can do it ourselves, we are learning how to be more adult like, right?",0
"Alot of things can be found offensive now days, but that does not mean you take it away from others who enjoy it. Everyone has their own view, and opinon on things. For the things people find offensive I believe they should just simply stay away from it.     No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves. Somethings people MONTH1 find offensive others might enjoy. Its simple, if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries. Yes, there MONTH1 be alot of things that people take offensive, but that dose not mean take away the things others MONTH1 enjoy. I have been to many libraries in my life. I have not really seen anything offensive, but I have seen some books and movies for adults only. Honestly in my eyes its simple, if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it, because others MONTH1 enjoy it.     Its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves. Although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it. You have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions.",0

Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and esier. That way he wouldn't have to life a hard depressed life.

After that ride we sold my four wheeler and got a NUM2 ORGANIZATION1. Its the first time going to the dunes with my new four wheeler and I can't wait. We get to the dunes unload everything get our riding gear on and our helmets with our goggles on. It was thirty minutes of riding and my brother was jumping his four wheeler when some people showed up and was video taping him, which made him show off a little bit. So he was jumping in front of those people going further and further every time. My family couldn't stop smiling and laughing because he was showing up everybody there who was trying to out jump him. So when he got don't jumping the guys who were video taping him came up to us and they told us that he is really good and that we should follow them to another jump.So my brother trying to be cool whipped his bike around and wrecked it was funny my dad and I were laughing so hard our eyes were tearing up but lucky for him my dad and I were the only ones to see his little crash. So we went to go see if hes okay and he said yea so we took off. My brother and I were right behind them and our parents were no where in sight. I turned my head to look and see if they were behind us and when I look ahead of me all I see is a roost of sand in my face, which made me turn my handle bars so I hit a grass mound and the bike flew up in the air rolled off a little little hill and landed on my leg, my brother didn't knew he did that to me so I was stranded until my parents came. I don't know why but i couldn't stop laughing because believe it or not that wreck was actually kinda fun and funny because no matter what I did I couldn't seem to get that four wheeler off my leg.  About ten minutes passed by with my four wheeler on my leg and I finally heard a loud noise it was my dad and he came to save me so I told him what happened and he couldn't stop laughing at me. He told me he would get my brother back. So when we were on our way back to the truck my brother was behind my dad and my dad roosted him with sand so bad it made his goggles fall off! My parents and I couldn't stop laughing and we ended up pulling over so we could stop laughing at my brother. After that my brother doesn't roost me anymore.  It's been a year since we have started riding and still my brother has not yet roosted me. He still tends to show off. This one time my moms friends came out and my brother was trying to be cool and ride really fast from coming out of the dunes and he slid on the concrete and he wrecked in front of us and maybe like seven people, it was hilarious everybody was laughing besides my mom. He looked at his arm and he had road rash all down his arm. Well I guess that's what he gets for trying to show off. It's like every time he tries to show off he wrecks, so why does he keep doing it? I don't know why but maybe he should stop sometime so he doesn't wreck every time we go out there. Just kidding it doesn't bother me when he wrecks because they are usually funny. I thinks that's why we have so much fun out there because of him.",0
"If they are offensive they sholud be taken off the shelves becuase the little kids would'nt get they. And i think that they should not be and there and the frist place because almost every body goes to the lidraries. If i found the offensive they would promble get shut down or who ever put they would be fired. the kids should not see them or know about them at all. the offensive books, music,movies, magazines are not most to be found in a lidraries that kids go to.    I think that most people would be mad at the schools or the libraries because they got them. And most pairnts would go talk to the people that did that. But if that happen to me if my kid came home with one of the offensive magazineas or any thing i would ask them where you get it and then go to talk to the poelpe that runs it. And most of the people that founds those things would be mad at the kids and its not their promble that someone did that.    And the frist thing they should do is have a NUM1 or older on the books, movies, magazines, and music if they are in the libraries. They should not be where the kids go and read books or nothing like that. They should be where the people that are NUM1 or older get them but i still thing that they should not be and there. But if the offensive are in libraries people should take them to court offensive books, movies, magazines, and music",0
"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes his loving family and creates a appreiative, loving, and homey, comforting mood for the reader. The author thanks his parents for their kind and loving actions. It makes the reader feel admiration towards his parents and the author is trying to create a sense of appreciation and gratitude towards his parents. In paragraph NUM1, the author explains his appreciation for his parents; ""But in reality, there's no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such an early age and demonstration of how Important friends and family really are."" The author is also trying to create a comforting mood. When he explains the atmosphere of his home, he is trying to create a homey mood; ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (CAPS1 NUM2). This quote is comforting and adds to the homey mood. The author is also trying to create a loving mood in the sense that he is explaining the caring acts of his parents. In paragraph NUM3, the author describes his generous parents, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to... many people...

"I think we should have computers for great purposes. One reason is because there is a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on many different websites. My last reason is because you can send messages to a faraway place by using e-mail. My frist reason states that there is a lot more information on the internet. For example, if youn don't have the newspaper with you, but you have you laptop, you can get information that way. Did you know, over NUM1, NUM2 people use their laptops for information and not games. Another example is if we get the newspaper everyday but it doesn't have the article that we are looking for, we use the internet. When we look for information on the internet, you would use yahoo, google, and other informational websites that you need. My second reason states that there is some history on many different websites. For instance, you can go on a websites and learn about history everyday, insted of going to a museum about history everyday! One day, I had to make a project about the CAPS4 and I had four days to do it, you know what I did, I went on a historical website about the CAPS4. I got an A+ for my project. When people need history, it's always all around them on the internet. My very last reason states that insted of texting people from faraway places, why not just use an e-mail address. For example, you don't have to pay for an e-mail address. It's actually free and did you know, more than NUM3 million people around the world use an e-mail address insted of texting other people. When you don't have an e-mail address, it's very quick to make one. You don't have to waste money to text someone halfway around the globe. In conclusion, I think that we should have computers. One reason is that we have a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on some websites. And my last reason is because you can send messages to a far away place by using e-mail. Thank you for reading this article.",0

"The author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over. She uses geese as a symbol for spring, when she would start preparing for this test once again. The hibiscus budding in this paragraph shows hope, because it is once again, a start of a cycle as well as an object of reminiscence in the story. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices in order to convey hope, good memories, and fresh start.",0
"Patience is a virtue. You might hear that phrase a lot if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Heres a question for my audience what is patience? Do you know? Well in my essay, Im going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, its very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the ``CAPS1 services and goods such as pizza delivery NUM1 minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I cant deal with anyone younger than NUM1 years old. That will affect me in very negative way. Those are the pros and cons of having patience thank you for reading my essay.",0
"The Empire State Building was to be the tallest building ever made. At the top, was to be an accesable docking station for dirigibles called mooring masts. The idea of haveing a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building caused the whole building to be modified. It costed over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the mooring mast. This project was the first of its kind and had many obsticles like the modifications. Some of those obsticles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land. Although the bricks keep the tail from moveing around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not save. In the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise.",0
A time I was patient was when my mom was take me to my friends house to play foot ball. It is a long story but I will tell you anyways. It all started when my friend PERSON1 called me over to come play football. So I asked my mom for a ride she said yes. So when we were driving my ???? she had to get after things from the grocery store. She took in hule hour in there.

"Laughter play's an important role in relationships, CAPS1 also supports enjoyment and can be a persuit of happinees. Whenever i am laughing its either because i am really enjoying myself or im just having a great time.Many people don't have a very good sense of humor and dont laugh at thing's that are funny, whenever i watch a funny movie's that i like i sit down and wait for the very funny parts, but dont get me wrong, remember not to laugh to hard because you might wet youre pants by accident or who knows if you laugh hard enought you might even pull a ""whotammy ""and trust me that does not look pritty and then you will be embarresed infront of everybody. My favorite comedian is adam sandler because he is very funny and has a good sense of humor, he knows how to keep a person laughting and interested in his comedy shows and movies.when he made the big daddy movie CAPS1 was pritty good not to funny but CAPS1 was good.My secound favorite comedian is PERSON1 because he is funnyer that adam sandler by a lil bit but not quit as good though he also stars on a tv show called wild'n out that show really makes me almost cough out my lungs, especially when they bust out with youre mama jokes CAPS1 keeps you laughting and keeps the blood pumping thru youre body.so we all pritty much under stand what laughing is but most people dont really seem to laugh at things that are funny i cant quit undersatnd CAPS1 but my guess is tha t they dont have a good sene of humor but some people seem to lautgh at thing that dont even make sense i quit dont undestand that either but i guess its better to laugh than to not laugh at all. Some really good comedy movies that i can mention out right off the the bat that will keep you tuned and laughing thru more than half off the movies are grandmas boy, happy gillmore, dont be a menace to south central while siping my juice. Also zombie land CAPS1 is a heck of a good movie, i dont know its not just about making a funny movie just to make the oudience laugh CAPS1 is the way they make CAPS1 and how thery act and how good the backround story to the comedy movies is gonna be thats what i pay atencion to when ever i sit down and inspect what makes the movie funny also if i cant understaand a funny movie i see CAPS1 again and again till i understand what is so hallariouse about CAPS1.That pritty much covers the basics on laughter there are is youre basic information and what you need to knowabout CAPS1 and how to enjoy CAPS1 and use CAPS1 wisely cause remamber dont laught to hard because you dont want to end up pulling a ""whotammy"" in front off every one that around thank you for reading my test.",0

"There are a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another Reason consists of law CAPS1. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is defanitley not the City for this idea just because there is alot of people walking around the CAPS2 and there is many buildings around. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would CAPS3 to be over with the invention of airplanes. The idea CAPS4 disappeared.",0
"In the memoir, the mood seems to be happy, and grateful. To me it seems as if the author is trying to show his great love and respect for his parents and how they have taught him everything he knows and without them he would be nowhere.     ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courages thing thing than I could have ever done."" (CAPS1 NUM1)       This shows me that the author's mood is set to be happy and about love and how he is extremley grateful to have them in his life Also it shows his love for what his parents have taught him.     ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)

The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more. Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.,0

So there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist, when they were on there journey.",0
"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. Its just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. Thats the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.",0
"Libraries are known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about, whether that material is a book, movie, or magazine. Anyone can use the library, and it is a valuable resource to many people. So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves?     In past years, censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports. In almost all cases, library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library. I have to say that I agree with them. People have a right to choose what books they want to read, what movies they want to watch, and what music they want to listen to. People have opinions; people disagree. What one person loves, another person could hate. But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons. I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual, and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource, then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material.      In conclusion, censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong. It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves. Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material, and censorship makes that impossible",0

"Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the empire state. One obstacle the builders faced was the law stating airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. Also, the builders would have to reinforce parts of the building to support the stress the dirigibles would place on the frame.Lastly, nature would not allow the dirigibles to be safely docked due to the fact the violent winds would shift the back of the dirigible making it sway wildly. These obstacles made sure that dirigibles could not be docked at the empire state.",0
"The obstacles that needed to be overcame, to create the idea of a docking platform on top of what was going to be announced as ""The tallest building,"" was going to be tough. The steps taken to make this idea come to life, began with consulting with experts. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the ORGANIZATION1 in New Jersey. When it was time to start constructing, the issue of the stress the building would intake from the mass of the Dirigibles became a problem. They modified the buildings frame to accommodate the new situation. They also designed a stainless steel tower with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to achieve the goal of ""The Mooring Mast""",0

"Why would you ever censor anything in a library? Apparently because things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect. can be found offensive.  If something is considered offensive, why put it in a library anyway if its going to be open to anyone in the public, including children?       First off, censorship is important but we don't need it in libraries of all places.  Libraries is a place where all sorts of literature comes together in one place where it can be seen and read by those who admire literature.  Censorship is stopping this by pulling books off shelfs because they are considered offensive.  If a book is offensive, first decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to.  Then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience.  If it is found to be offensive to an adult audience, then it should be pulled off the shelves of a library.  Otherwise it should be placed in the adult section of the library.     Libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature.  As mentioned before, if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult audience, it should be placed in an adult section.  Books that are suitable for children should be put in the children's section.  You can even have a such section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers.  Sections in a library almost completely defeats the need of censorship.  Sections help correctly place books and other pieces of literature in a library so that onlt readers of certain suitable ages MONTH1 read them.     In conclusion, sections in a library can be used instead of censorship.  If we were to censor what books were on the shelves in a library the eventually there will hardly any books for anybody.  Sections help keep books in a library, but keeps them in a place where the right audience can view them",0
"I think Minfong Ho concluded her story Winter Hibiscus the way she did to show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. Now that she had a moments of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they wouldve wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is why I feel that Winter Hibiscus was concluded in this way.",0

"Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not.     I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive.     In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different point of view. The author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive.",0

"In the story winter hibiscus by minfong Ho, the author is concluding the story with this last sentence because its showing everyone that the seasons over for the growing of the plants but when it comes time for the flowers to start growing again she will be back to take care of the plants because its her favorite & they are what she lives for now that she has to take care of them. Also the author probably put the conclusion of the story like that to get people interested in reading more of the story later on because your getting left in a sense of suspense, because you dont know if she really will go back to the plants or just about them. another reason I think, the auther ended it that is because its still snowing she cares about the plans but she isnt gonna worry about them until it is the right time again. For example she says when they come back then I will take the test again, thats showing she isnt giving up on anythin she loves and she will keep trying until she gets it.",0
"Computers are not something to be afraid of. They help many people in different ways, like the CAPS1, teachers, students, scientists, and locals dealing with their jobs and daily life. Hasn't a computer already helped you today? Because of that, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future. Who has said that by using computers you dont interact with your family as much? Well, I can tell you that I'm staying in contact with my grandma, cousins, and aunts through my e-mail. With e-mail you can check up on news or simply write to friends and family! Also, if you are planning a trip to visit your loving family members, dont bother with a map that gets in your face all the time and you just ""happen"" to get lost, try going on ORGANIZATION1 maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way. Computers can do more than creating a simple map, it can give you precious information! Many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids. The kids can look up LOCATION1 and in NUM1 seconds they have all the information they need! In most school paper you have to type and provide what websites you used to achieve finishing the paper. What is also nice is that you dont need to go through huge books for one small piece of information. It is much easier, looking it up on the computer. Speaking of not using big books for imformation computers don't use paper and will lead us to a healthier tomorrow! Millions of toms of paper land in landfills each day! By using computers we could read online and conserve paper! Another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future. people have already created touch-screen computers and computers will grow even more! Many people think that using computers is a bad thing, but look at the facts! Doesnt the newspaper write the newspaper on computers? If they didnt, they would be having hand cramps all the time! And what about docters dont they have your medical history on the computer, if not all these papers would get lost!

"There are all kinds of computers, but they all do the same thing. Computers help people with anything they need. Such as, you can go online and chat with people, you can buy and sell things, you can go to college, you can learn anything, and it helps you type up your homework neatly. I personally think that computers are very helpful and we are lucky to have them. Going online can give you so many opportunities for anything. From going to college online when you don't have the time to go in person to just talking to your friends. You can learn just about anything on the computer and it's just so much fun. The computer to most people I know is the greatest invention besides the obvious ones. Going to college online is so easy. There isn't alot to it. Alot of people in the country online for college. For instance, parents that want to go back but can't go in person or someone who has alot of work but cant fit in the time to actually go to college. But they can go online and take classes on their free time. Also, talking to friends online is fun too. When you arent at a friends house you can chat with them online. Maybe you can go on CAPS1 or CAPS2 or CAPS3 or even your email. There are many ways to do it on tha fabulous computer. The computer is also jam-packed with loads of information that is helpful to anyone in the world. You can learn about different countries, people, or even the recipe of apple pic. Who knows what you can learn. The computer has things for every person in the world. Since we are all different. Some of us like to buy or sell things on the computer or do our homework. Maybe even just a fun computer game is nice. Every person in the world is different, but we have one thing in common. The world knows we need computers and computers are the smartest thing since the calculator. Buying and selling things on the computer is easier than it looks. All you have to do is put what you want to sell online or look online what you want to buy. Then you buy it or sell it. There is more to the process like the ORGANIZATION1 people bring or take it to or away from you. But that just the basics. You can also do your homework neatly on the computer if you have a messy handwriting. Therefore, the computer has so many things that can benefit you and the world with everything it has to offer.",0
"Libraies should not be able to remove books, movies, and  magizines off the shelves just because some kids might be offended. If the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies, magizines, and books that most kids love to read and watch then the kids that like those books , movies, and magizines would not return to the library any more.           For example, I like to listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and rap. But, the people that go to church just like to listen to church music. If your with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull in the parking lot listening to your rap music some people MONTH1 not like it. This doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them.          Libraries should have a policy stating that if a child should check out a book or magizine or rent a movie, that they should have the childs parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book, magizine, or movie. Libraries should have an age limint to check out books and magizines. If kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned. This permission slip will and can be used for all movies.           Libraries should not remove their books, magizines, or movies. They should make a policy to allow older kids to check them out. So, library material should be a choice",0

"CAPS1 best friend, LOCATION2, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, CAPS2, he started to use a computer and now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but CAPS3 gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. CAPS1 friend wasn't the only person who learn hand-eye coordination. About PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows CAPS3, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people.

"Challenges can be faced when radical ideas are put into action. When faced with task of docking dirigibles, or zeppelins, atop the Empire State Building, the builders ran into challenges that are natural to come along with new thoughts. One challenge included was the fact of the wind from such an altitude as the Empire State Building made situations perilous for blimps and people on the ground. ""Even if the dirigible wer tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". (CAPS1 NUM1). Another obstacle faced by builders was difficulties with the laws of the United States government. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (NUM2) These were some of the difficulties dealt with by builders in the construction of the Empire State Building's mast.",0
"There are many problems with trying to dock dirigibles to the Empire State Building. First, there was a German dirigible called the Hindenburg that caught fire due to the hydrogen. Having a dirigible go up in flames over dense New York would result in many lives lost. Second, the wind 1,250 feet in the air is very strong and unpredictable. There was no way to be sure that the dirigibles could even dock or be controlled once docked. Lastly, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It would almost certainly be against the law for a dirigible to be so close to a building with so many people in it. Since these problems all could result in deaths, the idea was thrown out.",0
"There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because someting is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't  want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove somthing that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch.     First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at whats offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it.     Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that persons first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it; not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community.     Lastly, let's say that in a library, theres at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library.      Thats what I think about cencorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them",0
"It was a cloudy DATE1, but nothing to be sad about when among friends. This circle of friends had just spent the whole weekend together, and they were heading home. I was among this group as a young CAPS6 who had known this group for three years. Three years before, I was shy, but something changed that. The group was called ORGANIZATION2. This ORGANIZATION2 was for teenagers and even some collage students. There were very few of us though. It was our last year as ORGANIZATION2, then we would be kicked out of the church we were meeting at. Together, we made that weekend be are best and last ORGANIZATION1. The boys were very comfortable around the girls, so much in fact, that they were going to make a deal with us. The deal was that during the car ride, if we rubbed their backs, then they would rub our feet. At CAPS2 the girls thought this to be a crazy idea, but as time went on, that foot rub seemed really good. Three pairs were made, with a boy and a CAPS6 in each. The boys sat in the second to last row in the car, and the girls sat in the back. I rubbed PERSON3's back, but it's okay. Out of all the girls there besides his sister, I know PERSON3 the best, so I was perfect for the job. This moment was a very giggly time for the girls, and a very relaxed time for the boys. While the boys were falling asleep, the girls were laughing hysterically. Since we had our feet right beside the boys for them to rub, then the easiest way to wake them up was to kick them. This just caused more laughter, and more alert boys.  After we had enough with the foot and back rubs, then we needed to find something new to laugh about to make the time pass faster. It was the DATE1 before DATE1, so our ORGANIZATION2 leader gave us each a bag of candy hearts. The little messages on those candy hearts could entertain us for about an hour and a half. We would pick one randomly out of the bag and hand it to someone. I ended up giving both PERSON3 and PERSON1 candy hearts that said, ""CAPS1"". They were very confused, but again it caused more laughter. PERSON3 accidentally gave one to PERSON1 that said, ""CAPS2 CAPS3"". Andrew got hearts multiple times that said, ""CAPS4 CAPS5 CAPS6"".  Once that was beginning to become boring, then we found a new way to make the candy hearts entertaining. We would read the heart CAPS2, then give it to someone saying it was from someone else. Kyrene gave one to PERSON4 saying it was from PERSON2 that said, ""CAPS7 NUM1 CAPS4"". Whenever we had one that said, ""CAPS9"", then we would give it to PERSON1 saying it was from LOCATION1. Earlier she had said to him, ""I thought you were CAPS10 for a moment there"", but numerous people thought she said, ""I thought you were CAPS9 for a moment there."" CAPS11, we try to make it up to PERSON1 for PERSON2 by giving him ""CAPS9"" candy hearts.  We ended that DATE1 with hugs, goodbyes, and laughter of retold inside jokes. A few phone numbers were exchanged, and a few that should have been weren't. The trip ended well, and everyone felt just a little bit closer. We could hug this person CAPS11, or we could get this person's phone number. Something in us changed that we could be a little closer.  In my experience, I would say that laughter is only one element, because to get laughter you need to love who your laughing with. If I didn't love the people I was in the car with then I would have not laughed with them. They say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I don't believe this is true. I think it's love that is the shortest distance and laughter is just love being shown. The statement that laughter is the shortest distance is assuming that laughter is the cause, but in truth, it is the effect. Love is the cause of laughter. If laughter was the cause of love, then this world would be doomed to never know either. Without love, there can be no laughter.",0

"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author.",0
"The world that we live in today is full of technology. Everything from check out isles at the grocery store to coffee makers at home are being upgraded all the time. The technology has many great things about it, but theres also a huge down fall. The most common technolgy device is the computer, its a great thing to have but its also very bad. The computer can be used to bully, it can take time from exercising and it even takes from your social and grammer skills. We all know the websites such as facebook, myspace and CAPS1. They sseem harmless but its really just a place for harassment. Their said to keep friends in touch, butkids use them to say hurtful things about each other. Half the kids in my eighth grede class have admitted to either getting bullied or bulling over the computer. If so many kids are getting hurt by the then why do we all keep using computers? Many kids MONTH1 say they don't spend to much time on their computers but NUM1 out of NUM2 kids in my school admit that they do. Checking the computer is the first thing they do when they get home from school and the last thing hey do before going to sleep at night. All the time these kids spend on the computer is taking away from exercising and enjoying life as a child. I've seen many kids gain exessive amount of weight because they don't eat proper food they don't exercise and they shut down from reality all because they are obsessed with their computers. kids are even getting portable computers, thats how addicted they are. Do you want your kids like that? However, all these programs and websites that are on computers have a way to inneract with friends, and socialize. But all of this is taking away from your social skills, even grammer. Most kids and teenagers would rather talk over the internet thant face to face, and half the time they don't even spell word correct or use proper grammer. In the long run all this talking over computers is going to hurt them when it comes to school and getting a job. I know that computers are good for school because you can research stuff for projects and e-mail your job. But the time spent, kids getting bullied, and the now lack of social skills is not worth it. We need to cutback on our societys use of computers because it will help us all when it really counts. Just ask yourself do you want your kids getting bullied? Do you want to gain weight? Do you want to loose your social and grammer skill? Just ask yourself these questions and you just might change your mind.",0

"Some ""experts"" are warned that people should spend too much time on their computers. Yet, look at all of the advantages to a computer. You can develop better hand-eye coordination skills, internet with friendsfamily who could live hundreds of miles away, and you can learn about cultures all around the world, along with the people who live in those countries, without ever leaving home. In my oponion, computers overall benefit society, helping us learn more & more every day. First off, there are many skills you can develop on the computer. For example, when playing interactive high-paced games, kids get a sense of awareness timing, and hand-eye coordination. Not to mention, with new advances in technology, people can now go to college without ever leaving home, and at a much lower price, while still getting a great education. Many people even work from home, thanks to their computers. These are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers. Secondly, why buy a ticket to a far away country that's fairly expensive, trade in all your money for the money they have there, go through the hasslels of baggage, ect. When you could simply go online and look it up on the computer? You can go online, look up some of that countries recipes, language, pictures, people without the hassel of going there. Not to mention, for kids who aren't old enough to LOCATION1, or have to do a report on it, instead of making through countless textbooks, newspapers, libraries in general, they go online, CAPS1 their country, and they have must, if not all the info they need right there. So not only is getting the information then you would've learned in the first place, thereby, extending your knowledge. Finally, the internet helps people connect. Leading experts from the CAPS2.S.A., or Family security agency, says that since people have started using programs like ORGANIZATION1 and facebook, many more families, who live in different countries, have been able to re-coonect and get to know one-another. For example, if you have an uncle who lives in LOCATION1, you could both buy cameras for your computer, install them, and within minutes, be seeing each othertalking face to face. I think this is better then simply writing letters to them, as it's quicker, and you get to connect more. Same goes if a friend or you move away, but want to stay in touch. A quick facebook account or ORGANIZATION1, and you'll still be good friends. So all in all, yes, computers do benefit society, as they help teach people skills, learn about distant culturesfar away countries, and connect people, who might live in different countries. I don't see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society. So yes, computers have a positive effect on people.",0

"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues included safety, nature and an existing law. Safety was the greatest obstacle. These dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" CAPS1 the buildings in downtown New York stand so close together, one building such as the Empire State Building catching on fire could have devastating effects. The hardest problem to overcome would have been nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It would have been impossible to keep the back of a dirigible from swiveling around. Also, the dirigibles would be hanging high above cars and people on the streets below. The last reason the dirigibles should not be moored at the Empire State building was because of a law that prohibited ""airships flying flying too low over urban areas."" This made the entire plan illegal, and although it was a good plan, it was not well thought out.",0

I believe that things shouldn't be taken off the shelfs because a few people are offended. There MONTH1 be a few that don't like something but for every few that don't like it there are some who do. For example there might be a book that makes females look dumb but personally it doesn't affect me but there are some girls who get offended because thier superior knowledge.     I have a friend who gets offended by movies that the black guy always gets in trouble or dies first. So if we removed every movie that offended him what would be left. I feel offensive when a magazine shows girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure about themselves. Even though I feel offended I'm not going to request them to remove it because there are some magazines that give tips and actually helps people feel better about themselves and if I took that away from them it could cause issues.     If there is something that is removed from shelves it should have a good reason. Like if there was a magazine that showed nudity I would understand them removing it so a kid doesn't see it.Some libraries remove things that could potentially cause a great issue. Maybe a newspaper talks about a great disaster and every one swarms the stand attacking each other. Something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued.     Yes I agree that there are some people who would request the  stuff to be removed but you can't always get your way. I know people would say thats not fair but there is a saying that says 'life isn't fair' and thats true. So next time you hear some one wanting something removed tall them this or next time you want some thing removed you refer back to this.     So in conclusion things shouldn't be removed unless nessecary. So when someone is offended thats their problem. You can always walk away you dont have to look or listen.,0

The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength. This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, a lot of stress would be put on the building's frame with a thousand foot dirigible held to it, so the builders would have to make many modifications to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" CAPS1, safety was a paramount reason as to why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there because of the highly flammable gas, Hydrogen that is used in most dirigibles. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" CAPS2, nature was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. Violent air currents caused shifting winds, making the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast, which wasn't safe for the pedestrians on the streets below. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose.",0
"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' CAPS1 quote from PERSON1 voices a strong point on citizenship. Censorship happens everywhere you are. Whether its a book, a magazine article, or even a tv show things are censored. Censoring things doesn'CAPS7 make anything more enjoyable, but infact makes less things enjoyable.     I think that things that are offensive should niot be removed from the shelf. Censorship diasble the viewer and or reader to be able to enjoy the full potential of things. I myself watch tv shows all of the time. When the censor things it makes me angry. I already know what the words are so why censor it. PERSON2 wrote a famous book called ORGANIZATION1. and that books has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term. I have two things to say about it. One if it offends you then you shouldn'CAPS7 watch or read it. Second one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was language used back then. So then one could take in thoght when the book was written, what was the time of when the book had taken place, ect.     There are two books that I read called the CAPS2 and CAPS3 NUM1. Both books have one thing in common. The use of censorship in their society. In CAPS3 NUM1 books are censored. CAPS1 causes one to challenge that concept because he and others felt that it wasn'CAPS7 fair for books to be banned. Also in the CAPS2 a boy challenges his CAPS6 society because they too censored certain things. Censorship also happens in todays' media. Some example are CAPS7.V shows. TV censors vulgar language, and sometimes violence and gore. Now its understandable to censor childrens shows but shows for mature audiences are unacceptable. Considering the freedom of speech one can express. Also mature shows are only ment for mature people to watch them so why censor them?     Katherine Paterson makes a valid point in her quote. I feel that if you find something to be offensive then don'CAPS7 read or watch it. If you feel that something is so offensive to you that you have to compell otheras in to believings what you think then you are wrong. People should have the right to read, watch, or listen to anything they want uncensored.",0
"Computers do not benefit society today. Computers have made technology a necessity, many people don't spend enough time doing other activities, and they do not benefit your health. Do you want a world full ORGANIZATION1 people who have their eyes glued to a computer screen? Computers are very helpful to all people but they are adicting. Computers were made to get your tasks done quicker and easier. For example you can shop online and google things. We live in a generation where computers have become a necessity instead ORGANIZATION1 pleasure. According to PERSON1, a psychologist at the ORGANIZATION1, more than PERCENT1 ORGANIZATION1 people, now-a-days, are inside on their computers. Furthermore, computers are making people lazier. Instead ORGANIZATION1 going to the store to buy things or walking to your friends house to talk, you would typically use the computer to do so. Therefore, people don't spend enough time doing other things. For example, on a sunny and beautiful day you would think that most kids would be outside having fun, but this isn't thet case anymore. For children who are old enough to use  work a computer, they'CAPS1 be inside on that nice day. There are many nice things to do on a computer, like chatting with friends, checking your e-mails, and facebook. Even though these things are pleasurable, you should limit your time on the computer. Most ORGANIZATION1 the time that you spend on the computer could be spent outside or at the movies. Not being on the computer could help small buisnesses too. If you pay money to do an activity, or buy something, watch something it would make a difference in the small buisness's profits. On the other hand, computers don't benefit your health. Mac. magazine says that there are health risks when you use your computer all the time. PERCENT2 ORGANIZATION1 people become obese and have vitamind CAPS1 deficiancy from using their computers so much. When using your computer you could be working out or exercising, and this causes obesity. Also, if you are inside all the time, you wont get the healthy amount ORGANIZATION1 sunlight that you need, thus you have a vitamin CAPS1 deficiancy. Another health risk is having bad eyes. If you spend hours a day on a computer your eyes can get permanently damaged. Do you want your child  children to be put at risk for using a computer too much? In conclusion, it is safe to say, that computers do not benefit society today. Many people have an addiction to technology, you could be using your time more wisely, and computers put your health at risk. Although computers do allow us to have an easier time accomplishing tasks, abusing the privlage will have consiquenses on everyone.",0
"There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing CAPS1 new beginning that she will have to go through the next year.",0

"Laughter, one of life's greatest gifts. Have you ever laughed so hard that you cried? What about laughed so hard you can't breath, or noise no longer escapes from your lips? I am the type of person that can CAPS6 at something so stupid that when I get done laughing, I don't even know why I started laughing in the first place. I can CAPS6 so hard that nothing comes out at all! CAPS1's amazing what laughter can do to a persons heart. The way CAPS1 makes you feel, the way CAPS1 makes you act. CAPS1's so contagious, and CAPS1 happens all around us everyday. You are never too old for laughter, CAPS1 happens to the best of us. young or old, CAPS1 doesn't matter. Laughter has no age limit. One time CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4 and I stayed up until three in the TIME1. We were so delirious, and kooky, we acted like crazy people. Now we have the type of relationship where we can CAPS6 at almost anything. Literally almost anything... As we were staying up, we drank lots of soda and had sugary foods to fuel us for the night. We made up songs, we danced around CAPS2 house, and CAPS1 felt like we laughed for hours! I laughed until tears were flowing out of CAPS2 eyes, and i couldn't get a breath out of CAPS2 heaving lungs. When CAPS1 gets to the silent laughing, CAPS1's even more funny because that person can't control CAPS1, and they look so hilarious because there rocking back and forth, with this silly expression upon their face, not making any noise at all. Have you ever just laughed for what feels like a lifetime? How did you feel after that ""lifetime"" of laughter? CAPS1 almost feels as something as powerful as the sun just warms over your heart and soul. When I CAPS6 I feel all the happiness and emotion just flow all throughout CAPS2 entire body. CAPS1's one of the greatest feelings in the world, I really can't think of a greater feeling than the warmth that laughter brings. CAPS1's so great when you and a CAPS3, or group of friends can sit back and enjoy the laughter you share. Even when your feeling down, maybe need some cheering up. You can always depend on a CAPS6 to pull you through. No matter what mood I'm in, CAPS5 I hear someone laughing, CAPS1 is so hard to not join in. Laughing is so contagious! CAPS1 effects us in our everyday life's. I bet you that, you cannot go one day without hearing someone CAPS6, or you not laughing yourself. I probably CAPS6 about five hundred times a day, CAPS5 not more. I love hearing people CAPS6, CAPS1 brightens CAPS2 mood and also CAPS2 day. I would most definitely say laughter is very important and beneficial for a relationship. I mean imagine the world without laughter. Boring, right? CAPS2 advice, CAPS6 like you heard the funniest thing in the world. CAPS6 like there is no tomorrow. Who cares CAPS5 people thinks its dumb. You'll feel much better after you have that tear-induced, hard to breath, silent but oh-so therapeutic CAPS6. Laughter really is the shortest distance between people!",0

"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest  rason was one of safety Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house. They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people.",0
"The builders of the ORGANIZATION1 thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers. They soon realized that there were some problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph NUM1, most LOCATION3 dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized it just wasn't worth it.",0

"Have you ever been to a library and found a book offensive?In my opinion I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason. The reason being say if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was to expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it. Most libraries that I've gone to have certain sections for adults and children. That means there would be appropiate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given. If children under age were to wander off into the adult section that would be their fault if they saw something unapproiate not the libraries.     If the case was if every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, I belive that the libraries wouldn't have as much of books in their buildinds that grown ups would like to read. Of course I'm not trying to say that there should be extermely unappropriate books wandering around in the library that the small children should see. I'm just saying that the adults do have the right to have books that they would be interested in.When I've gone to the libraries I have found books that I have enjoyed reading and I'm not the type of person that would just grab a book and be interested in right away. There are books, movies, magazines, and music that have strange titles that some people might take offensive to, but those are the ones that get read more or listend to more or watched more.     I believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive. If the person doesn't like the idea of the people in the library not taking the material off; it's the person personal problem I think. For example there is this book called 'CAPS1' and it's about a teenager who got into drugs real bad and got pregnate at a young age. That book was one of the best selling books in the world. If somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then it's their loss.     I mean if there were a book about how to murder somebody then yeah I would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immeditely. Except no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up so why worry about it.If there were ever to be that type of situation then that would be bizzare.But I highly doubt that it would come to a point like in time. So in conclusion that is my opinion on this",0
"In DATE1's world there are so many things around our children that if we tried to take materials away, we would be take most of what is made for entertainment. Many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger. Well, why don't we do something about it? People need to stop complaining about everything and just do something. Adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them.      If you were to walk into any store these days you would find something that you would not want your children to watch, see, or listen to. I believe people are doing the best they can to seperate these materials from the family oriented materials. Sometimes it is just not enough, children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age. These children share what they have with their friends, and these other children start doing the same things.        Many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn. The material that talks about drugs, parties, and drinking does not even need to be on a radio station or a television channel that a young child would listen to. Our adults need to also learn that it is not good for the children to learn and listen to these things, and to keep their children away from it as much as possible.     Like the author said if everyone was able to take something off of the shelves there would not be anything left. We are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see, but we can start to eliminate some of them. The others we can not eliminate we can continue to keep on the shelves and other places, but just kept where children don't go.     I believe that our towns and cities can do a better job of keeping our children away from CAPS1 rated movies, negative songs, and different books that talk about 'adult things.' The children are the future of the world. If that's all they are watching and thinking about then it does not look good for the future. There are many things we can do to stop our children from watching, listening, and learning about these negative things in life. Keep the children away from these materials, it will be a better world if we do.",0

In conclusion, they did face many problems.",0
"Many people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young reads. Many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely. People think that have young people exposed to this offensive material will effect the choices they make, and how they will react in certain situations. At the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves. They say that everyone has the right to read or listen to whatever he or she wants to. Its that persons right to choose weather or not it is age appropriate for them or not. Its not some elses right to take away choices that aren't theirs.     People who belive that they should remove this material from libraries think it will corrupt young minds. They believe that this material will convey a message that it is alright to do what these books and music are saying. This in turn will create a different mind set for the young reader. Which MONTH1 cause the young reader to be more aggresive or more like to make bad decisions about there well being or the well being of those around them. These people want there libraries to be about learning and be a healthy eviornment were young minds can grow naturaly and unharmed by offensive material.     People who believe that they should leave this material on the shelf say its no one elses right to make this decison for you by removing them. Its the readers right to choose weather or not to read the material. The read will most likely learn what the material is saying regaurdless of weather it is in the library or not. They believe that it would be better for a young reader to learn about it in a safe enviornment then to have some one else later in there life show them or tell them. The enviornment maybe alot more dangerous then a library if learn though some one else.     I believe in both in a way. I believe it is not some one elses right to remove these books from libraries. But i also believe that it should not be avalible for young readers to get. These books maybe be offensive to some people but its there choice to read it. They do not have to read these books it does not affect them. I believe the books not suitable for young readers should be placed on either a higher shelf or in a different part of the library where young readers do not have acsess to. If a readers parents want them to learn about it in a safe enviornment then they should sit there children down and explain it to them themselves. In the end we all have our rights and we use those to choice weather to read or listen to certain material. It is no one elses choice besides your own.",0
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said Then I will take that tes again, it means she knows she has another chance.

In the story it says she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time shell do great.",0
"In my opinion I agree that it benefits society. The reasons that support my decision are lots of buisnesses use computers to work, fast food resturants use computers, and schools use computers. Computers are all needed just for those reasons. My first reason is buisneses use computers to work. Workers use computers for designing, filing peoples names, and to type papers, and essays. People in the designing industry don't use paper and pencil anymore, because they use designing softwares to work. Instead of filing in a cabinet people and workers use computers to put their patients, clients, and workers. Computers can hold more information and files than cabinets can. People also type papers and essays for work. For example, news reporters have to write a report and type it for their company in order to get it to publish. If workers in buesness were to need to use computers to file, type, and design clothes and games. My second reason is that fast food resrurants or even resturants use computers, instead of using cash registers. For example ORGANIZATION2 or ORGANIZATION1 use technology to type in peoples orders, and amount they pay. Back then they used to use cash registers, in order to get money out they need to click a button, but now the have all locked up using computers. Every resturant has at least a touch screen computer in it to use. So resturants need computers to survive the world. My third reason is schools need computers for students and teachers to write reports, file the students name and grades into it. Students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work. Teachers need computers to file the students name, grades, and information, instead of using a cabinet. Teachers also use computers to make homework pages and they need to print stuff off of word. So schools use and need computers for students and teachers use. In conclusion I agree that computers benefit society, because buisnesses need them to work, design, and file, and fast food resturants so they can take peoples orders and to use in schools for students and teachers use. So thats why it benefits the society.",0
"Technology is really a fascinating thing in life is it? Take a computer for example, they can check information online, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allow people to communicate. This absolutely benefits society. Well, it makes life a lot easier and faster for people. Don't you agree? Do you ever forget what your homework was or what time does something start and end? Well you can always checks information online, CAPS3 you ever forget! So there, you can be on task and get ready early. For example, you need to know what time a movie starts at the movie theatre so you check online! Also, you can forget the steps of how to do something on your project or homework, so you check online! So whenever a student forgets, he can check online instead of coming tomorrow to school and saying, ""CAPS1 I didn't know what to do,"" or, ""CAPS1, I forgot how to do it."" CAPS2 you ever wanna travel to places but you knew nothing about the place? Or how much would it cost? Or have you ever wanted to learn about a famous person, for example, PERSON1? Instead of going to the library and reading through all these books to learn something, you can just go online! There are millions and millions of websites about places and people. Therefore, it makes it much easier to learn about a certain place, person or thing. The computer can be really helpful and useful. Plus, you can plan vacation, to a place and be sure you will have enough money by checking the price online! So you won't have to worry that you wont have enough money when you got there. CAPS2 you ever want to communicate with your friends all day long without wasting minutes? In fact, you can communicate with multiple friends on the computer. For example, chat rooms can reach up to hundreds of people. Therefore, you won't have as much trouble trying to communicate to all your friends at a time on the computer than on the phone. Also, you communicate with people around the world. This includes your family members or relatives etc. CAPS3 they live on the other side of the LOCATION1. Plus, CAPS3 you have not seen them for awhile or haven't talked to them, you can webcam or video chat with each other. Keeping in contact with important people or your friends is a good thing. The effects that computers have on people are really something you should thank god for. You can check information about something CAPS3 you ever forget. You have the ability to learn about people and places easily and you can communicate with your family and friends!",0
"WHAT DO I THINK?         When I heard about the problems some librares were having; I thought to myself. What is the big issue over censoring movies, disks, books, and magazines. I know that children should not be around volgure language heard or read. Book that have pics MONTH1 not be eseptible for the eyes of our young chidren either.          The librares should come up with a solution. I was thinking that if they want to, they could make rooms of books that are only for certin ages. When people take these books of the shelf to report it or put that book somewhere else away from their children, they make the people that works their jobs much harder. Their should also be an adult with you if entering into the room. The adult must be NUM1 or older. If a child is found in their aloun, the workers of the library will contact the childs parents as a NUM2 offinse. The same thing goes for the second time your caght. The NUM3 time you are caught, you will get a phone call to your parents and baned from the librery for NUM4 mounths.            If you live in a big city, you MONTH1 have bigger better libraries. Some libraries have so many books, that you might have to get a cherrie picker to reach them. I know im a little off topic now but it is part of what im going to talk about. Their are massive libraries and small liebrareis. Its almost like the difference between pre- school and college. Now that is a big difference.          What i think the cities that have a bigger population should consist of two libraries side buy side. The one on the left would be for todlers ranging from NUM5 -NUM6.this library will be buissy alot. The library will consist of a day care so parents can look for a book in complet silence. The cidren at the ages of NUM7- DATE1 will also be in the librarie on the left,but upstars.They will have books made just for their age ranges. The will also be capabull of watch t.v. or playing minor games that dont posses violents on the computer.            The librarie on the right will look like a duplicate of the one on the left but is completly different on the inside. The reason the would do that is so kides would not try to get in because it looks cooler than the other. Our children look up to us in lots of differnt ways. Some MONTH1 inlude coping our every move. So when they see what you watch, listin to, and even read; they might want to do that too.            Know what i think most of you have learned from this is how to keep your children same. I dont mean like they are getting hurt or anything, but helps keep them grouing up and not knowing about things they shoiuldent at age NUM8. So, once again, I would like to let you know that we can fix this. We want to keep your children away from the bad things",0
I think the mood in this storie was mostly happy and grateful. Because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn about his heritage.

"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The mood that the author created was grateful, couragous, and generosity.First in the memoir, The first mood that the auther created is grateful. The author states that ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally gratefull)."" That means he was very excited and happy that his parents Passed down to him unstead of other family members thats why he is gratefull.next, his seconed mood is courageous because of his family. The author states that ""I often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" That means that all the times he had been with his CAPS1 or his dad they help him though life and difficulty of his education and work.lastly, his final mood was generosity because of all the time he was young. The auther states that ""there is no way to express my spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age. That means his mother allways depened on him to do all the work around the house in the yard. All in all in this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blueprints of our lives.

"CAPS1 the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend. And you think about the millions of people who spend their time chating on the computer. You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have, and would they be able to interact with friends and family members. Just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild? When you think about chatting to people do you think communicating in person or communicating by aim? I have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online. This upset me because this half mainly had kids that did not play sports but yet they were very talkative, so in aim a problem I still have yet to find out. I asked question like ""what do you do at home?"", ""are you a computer geek?"". (CAPS2 questions were only used to support my survey) The next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you to become obsessed with the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is. There are some who live on their computers like the CAPS3 CAPS4 (a comcast commercial) and some who don't know what a computer is (not commenting). I am here to teach about the benifits of exercising and not the un natural ways of a computer. Did you know people can loose weight by exercising? If you just pick up that old curling weight one curl is ten times as better then a click of a computer mouse dont believe me try it. Interacting with people is a big part of our life its how we get , give orders and its a lot faster type of communication then sending a email. Without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick for example, my father, when CAPS5 was divorsed the depression effected his body and mind. At the age of NUM1 CAPS5 got a rip in his small intestine that grew infecte and could have ended his life. I believe this was from lacks of communication and this happens everyday to everyone just open your eyes and relise what a computer can do to a man or woman. (CAPS5 was remaried to bonnie and now carrys a scars on his belly). This is a movement that should change the opinion of many, do people spend to much time on computers? Just get outside and talk to your neibor see what they think. I relly hope you consider my argument.",0
"Just CAPS1 walking through ORGANIZATION2 in a banana costume with one of your best friends. We were trying to find the best costumes for a CAPS2 party. When having so much fun by taking many pictures and videos we lost track of time. I can't even remember which one of us was laughing the hardest. CAPS3 is just one example of the crazy things my friend PERSON1 and I have done together. One thing is for certain, whenever we are together we are always laughing. Laughter reduces stress for both PERSON1 and I. We were team members for the past six years. Both of us competed as gymnasts at ORGANIZATION1. We worked out at the gym DATE1 for four hours each day. That gave us no time to hang out with friends and just enough time to do homework. At ORGANIZATION1, PERSON1 and I needed to be focused so we wouldn't get hurt. CAPS3 meant off the floor we needed laughter to reduce stress, as well as fear. In order to do that we would hang out a lot on the weekends and in the DATE2 sun.  Our friendship was strong because of all the laughing and fun times together. When either of us became stressed we would make the other cheer up by remembering the times when we laughed our heads off. Even when we are not together we often think of the memories we have shared together. As mentioned earlier laughter also helps to reduce fear. It helps because if you were not having fun and laughing you would think about all of the bad things at could happen to you; then would you do have laughter involved it makes you want to do whatever it would be with your friend.  The laughter PERSON1 and I shared always attached others to us. Whenever we were together others always wanted to join is because we were having such a great time together. For example, DATE2 we were at LOCATION1's house and we were playing outside on a warm, sunny day. We were laughing and all of a sudden one of her neighbors shows up. After one came, more and more kids and her friends came, after awhile it seemed like we had the whole neighborhood there with us. When we had a big group of people, PERSON1 and I would choose a different game that would be better for a lot of people. It usually was a hide and go seek tagging game. Even though it wasn't just the two of us we were always laughing because we would trick everyone that was playing. It created a good and positive bond for the two of us even though there were more people. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" CAPS3 is how PERSON1 and I became such amazing friends today. Without laughter, I do not think we would have been as close of friends if we didn't have laughter in our friendship. Our laughter brings us closer together every single time we see each other. Laughter really connects the bond between friends and its helps both of you get through hard times.",0
Some obstacles were that there was many sharp rods on surrounding buildings and so if it touched one it could pop. Another is if the wind is blowing it was hardunsafe for the dirigibles to be tied to the building.,0

"The mood I think the author created in the memoir was love.The reason why I say love is because to me he cares about the his family and he also stayed with his family tradition and he care and follows them. He also loved being with his family. For example in paragraph NUM1 in the article it say; ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to LOVE. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home. and to me that shows Love thats why I think the author created Love as his mood in the memoir.",0

In the memoir, he talks about the house he grew up in and the love in his home. Rodriguez describes the warmth of his kitchen and every thing that went on in it. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (paragraph NUM1). Rodriguez also describes the conection between the family and friends around him, ""countless extended family members came and went...My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (paragraph NUM2).With all of the love in this memoir, there is also a serious tone when the author describes the difficulties his parents had to face, to give him the best life that he could have.

"This year I tried out for the NUM1  grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For bragging rigts,we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didnt play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all CAPS2! Pretend like its the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadnt played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, can you do it?I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really tought me a lesson!",0

"In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in a very hot state of California. This affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated. The roads are very hilly so, he has to use alot more energy to get up the hills. Thats why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.",0
"Builders had many promblems with allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First of all in CAPS1 NUM1 the author exsplains that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would only add stress to the buildings frame"". Builders with that would have to construct the building to make it more stable. Also there were cases that outside the United States they use Hydrogen other then helium. Hydrogen is very flamible, and because new york is so populated it would not be safe to podestrions. Seeing this you can tell that builders had to many promblems coming from such an ""easy"" thing.",0

Another reason why i think at affects people CAPS1 there not eatin wat they need to eat there just eatin something quick like junck food so they could on the computer.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ NUM1). Although at first the builders looked past this, there were many other non-legal obstacles that they faced. There was also a safety issue with docking dirigibles, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¶ NUM2). One last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶ NUM3). With all of these obstacles it would not only be improbable, but close to impossible to dock dirigibles on the mast of the Empire State Building.",0
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is pride. I think that the mood created by the author is pride because in paragraph two it says ""...culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).""

Another reason why I think the mood is pride is in paragraph NUM1 it says ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" I also think that is an example of pride because it shows that he was raised with Cuban music and he still loves to listen to it.",0

"Having the empire state building dock and hold dirigibles brought up so hefty problems for the builders. Most of the problems resided among the idea of a mast, Al Smith knew that the mass would put to much pressure on the building frame, another was the baloon it's self, besides the U.S. most dirigibles were made of hydrogen rather than helium. The hydrogen made it much more dangerous to have in the crowded down town New York area, because hydrogen was much more flamable. a third obstacl was the winds as said ""the winds on top of the building were constantley shifting due to violent air currents."" It was also illegal to flyhold or dock a air craft so close to the ground. The docking and holding of the dirigibles at the Empire State building brought many issues and delemas making it hard to carry out such a idea for such a tall building.",0
"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted talks about The Mooring Mast or also known as the Empire State Building of how it was built and the original purposes of the building. During the making of the Empire State Building, builders faced issues in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there such as architectural problems, different gases, and the law. The builders faced a problem with the architect of building. The roof top was a flat as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" That meant the heavy dirigible would add stress to the building's frame Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigible used CAPS1 dirigibles were filled with different gases and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It meant that the building could catch on fire and whole downtown New York. They also faced an issue with the law saying ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". It explains it would be illegal to tie a dirigible on the building",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building is located in the densely populated New York City. Therefore, if the dirigible dangled high in the air above those people, it would surely be unsafe In addition to the safety aspect, one of the greatest obstacles was nature. The violent winds on top of the building are always shifting due to the air currents, therefore, it would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, thus making it illegal for dirigibles to ever fly up to the building.",0
"I think that the bad books, and all the adult books, magazines, and all the other articles should have its own room in the libraries. If you don't want little kids and teenagers in those kinds of books and magazines then put I lock on the door and if you have proof of CAPS1 that shows your NUM1 then you are going to be aloud back there if you don't have proof of CAPS1 then I guess your not going back to the adult section.     I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not aloud to be seen unless your NUM1, but the thing is kids have imaginations that if you read a book you can also see pictures just like a movie. The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be NUM1 or older to go back there and look. I bet its ruff when your kid is reading books and getting bad words out of them and saying them around like an even younger sibling, because then thats just going to cause a bigger problem then what you started out with.     People have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around. Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books and stuff like that up away from kids. I feel like once you become a parent you automatically think your smarter than a kid but yet kids are pretty darn smart. I understand its only a word but its disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inaproperiate things to nice people.       When kids do that then othere parents that don't let their kids do that stuff think ' wow these parents obviously don't care'. I have a feeling that its never going to stop but it would be better if childrens parents did not let them cuss around other people ok at home if your parents don't care then sure but when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train its all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines and the movies.      Im going to close this little description now and im still against kids cussing under the age of being a mature teen",0
"A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trails, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family is, that its much more than blood. It's unity, friendship and laughter, its the tears, pain and heartache. Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it to, I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family.",0

We all went outside and my grandpa had one of the snowmobiles ready for us and behind it was the hood of a truck so he could pull us from behind with it. My grandpa was driving the snowmobile and us kids were in the back. My grandma only went one once with us and than she got off because my grandpa was going way to crazy n we were all getting hit by each other when he was driving.

My grandpa went running inside to get my grandpas camera so she could take some pictures. It took her awhile to take them though because she is not that good or fast at taking pictures. Then when she was done we went back to snowmobiling for the rest of the day. After we got all done for the day I than really looked like a snowman.

"CAPS2 CAPS1      The first time i ever heard about the sport CAPS2 CAPS1 was the beginning of my freshman year. I was interested in doing it but i wasn't really sure about it. Though during eighth grade i had played volleyball just for the fun of it and really enjoyed it. I had decided i wanted to play volleyball once i got into high school. But when i got into high school my opinion of still playing on the high school volleyball team changed. I realized it was much more then i expected, the people, and the attitudes i realized that if i were to play on the high school volleyball team i wouldn't have any fun. So i started to look into joining the CAPS2 CAPS1 team. I had finally decided to sign up and join the team. I had really hope i would like CAPS2 CAPS1 because it was my first year on the team and i had absolutely no idea what to expect of it.          The first day of practice, after school i went into the girls locker room, changed and took everything with me and went out to the track shed. When i got out there, i saw a lot of people i had never seen before, except for the kids in my grade and also my best friend. My coach PERSON1 started to talk to everyone that was new to CAPS2 CAPS1. She told us that it would be a great experience and it was a a great sport and also it was more of a individual sport rather than a team sport. But also we did many things as a team. After she had talked and discussed the basics of CAPS2 CAPS1. We we're to jog our warm up lap and then stretch as a team. Then we were to start our run for the day and everyday was a different work out either a road run or a track work out. I began to really enjoy CAPS2 CAPS1. At first, i was beyond sore and couldn't move at all. But as the season started to really get going i eventually got into shape and looked forward to practice after school every day. We trained and got ready for my first race which made me very nervous i had no idea what to expect my first race ever and i was so scared and nervous. But after, i had ran my first race ever i felt good and was proud of myself. CAPS2 CAPS1 is something i have always loved every since my freshman year when i first started to run.      One of my most favorite races we've ever done was called ""CAPS5 CAPS6"" the first time i ever ran in that race was my freshman year, it was like of our third or fourth races of the season. It also happen to be the first time we had done that race in over a couple years. So i was excited for it because i had heard about it and everyone was telling me how exciting it was going to be and that i would love it, the day of the race i was once again nervous like every other race I've been too and still am every since i first joined CAPS2 CAPS1. When we arrived at the destination we set up a tent, started to warm up for the each of the races that was going to happen a boys race and a girls race. We also went over the course and that's when i realized what everyone was telling me the mud pits and a huge steep hill and we had to CAPS2 a river twice. After the race, i had such a great time my team and i laughed and we all enjoyed ourselves. It was so much fun, our bus rides as a team, all the fun practices. As a team we enjoyed many laughs and all the fun times we've had together. My favorite year of CAPS2 CAPS1 would have to be my freshman year because it was my best season, i loved it. We grew to love each other and bonded as a team. Laughter was a big part of CAPS2 CAPS1 we laughed and enjoyed each others company as we practices and also as we were on bus rides on the way to our meets. We had a lot of fun, and laughed often as a team and that to me was a big part of getting to know my team and being able to bond and build relationships and friendships with everybody on my team. CAPS2 CAPS1 is a sport where laughter is a big part of running and having fun and enjoying everyone's company, without laughter our team would not be as happy,excited, or even ready to practice. Laughter is big in CAPS2 CAPS1 without it our team would not have as much fun as we've had over the years.",0

"I am writing to you today about how more and more people are using computers. I think that this is great. The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand-eye coordination, it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and it also allows people to talk online with other people. Keep reading to find out more. The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand-eye coordination, for example, there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers. You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard. Keep reading for more information. The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country, you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general. You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people. You can look up people like PERSON1 from DATE1's to PERSON2 who is our presiden now. Keep reading for more information. The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people. For example, you could set up and account on facebook, myspace, CAPS1, or CAPS2 and start talking to people. You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew. Keep reading to find out more. Lastly, I think that more and more people are using computers is agreat thing. They can learn hand-eye coordination, have the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to other people online. I talked to the people who have just started to use computers and NUM1 out of NUM2 people said that they had liked what they had seen. So, I want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it. Thank you.",0

Second, they didn't finish the building because the building couldn't hold all the weight that they wanted to put on top of it. Third, hydrogen is highly flammable and could catch on fire easily.

Well if you have a computer you do not have to deal with these all you have to do is go to sarch and put these person or place name and you will see that in less than a min you have information that will take hours to find in a library. I know this because it happen to me looking for a book that talks about the CAPS2 caladers. I could not find I had to go on a computer for the information. Secound reason why because computers are a good sorce of entertainment. You know if you got bord and you have computer you can easily just go on it and play so many fun games like CAPS3 CAPS4, dragonwars, or any fun game that you can find on a computer. There are so many games to chosse from that you will never get borad. Third reason is the computer is a fun way of talking to friends or family. Like are so many sites that you can chosse to talk to friend or family like CAPS5, CAPS6 or even ORGANIZATION2. Also did you know you can send videos or even pictures of stuff to friends or family. So go on a computers and talk to your friend even that person a picture or something. My cunclision is I hope you take want I said to heart and chosse want the newspaper have as a dision.",0
"Censorship being as touchy a subject it is in my belief should be very rarely upheld, yes I believe there should be exceptions such as censoring materials in a childrens library or a childrens section of a bigger library, but to censor is to take ones freedom of speech, and expression away from them and is by my standards nothing more than unamerican.     Censorship acceptions should definetley be held in certain circumstances such as on a children's television network or a school library. Growing up my parents have not set any regulations for me regarding censorship, ever since I can remember I have been able to watch, read, and listen to anything I have ever wanted so my opinion is obviously going to slide toward uncensorship right? Wrong, although I do believe that nothing should be censored from the general public except for in special cases, I believe that it is the parents choice and full responsibility regarding their childrens censorship needs. I myself when I am a parent are going to censor my children away from what I seem unfit for their age whatever it MONTH1 be.     The main reason that I am writing is to explain the moral issue that censorship is offering, yes the reason we consor is because we believe that the material is offensive or has ill moral, but these are the opinions and beliefs of the creators and being in a society that claims to be tolerant of one's beliefs we should respect the creator's beliefs even though it is not the belief of ourselves. To censor is to force an artist or in essence a creator to change they're very reflections of themselves, after all that is what a work of art is whether it be a painting, a musical piece, or a television show it shows a distinct look into the creators mind and beliefs to censor is to cut off or warp this communication between the audience and the creator thus violating the freedom of speech, and freedom of expression that our country holds so dear.     I call this a touchy subject because when there is childrens welfare involved it is always a touchy subject, to prevent children from being exposed to what their parents seem inapropriate I believe that we should retain a censorship in such places as childrens library or childrens television networks, but as a country we are putting too much responsibility and reliability on the hope that the government will censor what we seem unfit when in reality it should be the job and choice of the parents to censor what their children are exposed to. to solve this growing debate I believe the solution lies in the question, 'should we censor material' well yes and no I generally think that for every book, song, or creation that some seem unfit for society should be released as censored and uncensored, this would open up oppurtunities for children to read more advanced literature, will not take away from the personel expression of the creators, and will not deny the public what they are looking for because a censored material is a loss for the creator as well as the audience who enjoy it",0

"The books in the libraries that I have read so far dont seem like they would be offensive to anyone and I havn't really listen to the music in the libraries or watch the movies and the magazines seem fine to.  That doesnt mean that there isn't any of those that can be offensive to other people but if there is then I think that they should take them out of the libraries but I think if someone found something like that they would probably just put it back and not go there again.     If they took out every book, music, movies, and magazines that people thought were offensive then I bet alot of them would be out and that wouldnt be fair to other people because maybe they want or listen or read or watch them and they would be really mad if they found out they was taken out because other peoplr thought they were offensive.  Some people would probably understand that some of those could hurt someones feelings or be offensive to other people but then theres other ones that dont care.     I think that some of them should be taken out if they are really bad and I wouldn't want other little kids reading them and gettin their feelings hurt or anything but if there not that bad then I don't they should be gone and I don't think people would really care if those stayed in them.  If thiers ones that are really bad and if they stayed in the libraries then probably no one would want to come back to the libraries and sooner or later less and less people would stop going.      So the best thing to probably do is just take them out and keep the people that keep going in the libraries because alot of people enjoy reading and thats what they do for fun and they would be really upset if they couldnt go no more over something that stupid",0
"An obstacle the builders of the Empire State building CAPS1 was weight. If the story it says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly NUM1 feet below."" Another obstacle was nature. The story says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""",0
"Should certain materials be removed from your public library? Not everyone has the same views as eachother. What might be offenses to you, MONTH1 be enjoyable to someone else.      I personally don't believe that anything should be removed from a library, just because something you might not like someone could really enjoy. If you don't want to learn about something you shouldn't take that away from others who do.      I think that if they do start removing things from library shelves they should still be allowed to be viewed to those who want to. Even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely.      More and more books are banned everyday, and I personally don't think that's fair to the growing generation who don't get to enjoy the things the old generation have.      So I believe that no books should be removed from library's. If you don't believe or enjoy something doesn't mean someone else wont",0
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do.",0
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the violent air currents that were at the top of the building. Even if the dirigibles successfully docked at the top of the building the back end of it would be thrashing around from the wind. If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown New CAPS1 walk. Putting weights on the end of the blimp would help that situation but as CAPS2 says, ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. They learned their lesson and got it into their heads that their idea might not be so good after when the German blimp, the Hindenburg, was destroyed.",0
"CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like CAPS3 and CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right",0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem was designing the building to be able to withstand the stress from a thousand-foot dirigible swinging around it in the wind. The builders needed to find a way to distribute the wind pressure all the way to the foundation. Another problem was the strong winds surrounding the building; when the navy tried to dock a dirigible on it, it kept being tossed about by the strong winds, this problem was never solved. A third problem was finding a way to actually dock the dirigible, this was quickly solved with a winch. A final problem was the fact that the dirigibles were so dangerous, and couldnt safly dock, as well as a law that prevented dirigibles from flying close to buildings, which was created for that reason.",0
"She feels very connected  to this hibiscus plant because it renind her of her homeland.I think she is trying to say when the hibiscus plant shows its inner budding she will to.

"If someone is looking for an offensive book, they are going to find it, whether it's collecting dust on a library shelf or is brand new in a book store. The same goes for an offensive CAPS1, magazine, or movie. Removing the offensive items from library shelves will only cause the people searching for these items to look elsewhere.      Different people have different opinions on what is offensive and what is not offensive. The CAPS2 CAPS3 is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs. While many people found The CAPS2 CAPS3 offensive, others enjoyed the story. If the book had been removed from libraries because some people found it offensive, then others who really enjoyed the book would not have been able to read it.     Another reason libraries should not remove offensive items from their shelves is that, most likely, the entire book, magazine, movie, etc. is not offensive the whole way through. Even if a movie has one offensive scene in it, the rest of the movie could be a great story that many people would benefit from seeing. It is the same idea with a book or magazine. There MONTH1 be a few offensive chapters or one or two offensive articles, but very rarely will you find a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive the whole way through.      Of course, there are still offensive items that would be bad for younger kids to see even with the one or two offensive scenes, chapters, or article. There are easier solutions to this problem than having to remove the items from the shelves completely. One solution to this problem could be for libraries to put age limits on certain items, so that younger kids can't check out materials that are too innapropriate. But more importantly, this would be the job of the parents to monitor what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to.      Removing offensive books, magazines, music, and movies from the shelves of libraries would just cause more problems and complaints. I think it is a good idea to leave the material on the library shelves and caution library users to 'read at their own risk.'",0
"Last year, DATE1 it was my birthday, so I told my CAPS1 what I wanted for my DATE3 and out of everything I said CAPS1 I want a CAPS2 (CAPS3 station CAPS4).

So we walk over to the game. I she and their was two text and their was five people in the section so we grabed one of the two. But when we got in line half of the people in the store were already in line. Then we waited in that stupid line forever it literally to us like hours to get through to the front of the line. We got home at TIME1. This story is not about what I wanted its about patience. So I was patient for two and a half hours waiting to buy my CAPS2, werever you go use patience you will get thought about and treated nicer than you expect.",0
"Freedom to chose is something every person can have, such as what type of clothes you wear.  Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because everyone should have that right to chose.  Plus, there are other ways to avoid children getting inappropriate books besides taking the books completely out of the library.  Censorship in libraries should not happen because if someone is eighteen, they should have the right to chose what they want to watch anyways, the parents can censor what books and movies they want there kids to read and see, and there are offensive things and inappropriate things on television that everyone has access to as well.     First of all, if a person is eighteen they should have a right to read whatever books they chose because they are grown adults.  Eighteen year olds can go into rated CAPS1 movies which would be about as bad as a book most likely.  In our society, people that are eighteen can do almost whatever they chose because they have freedom.  For example, adults can look up whatever they chose on the internet, and so can everyone else of all ages.  So, if they wanted to read a book like that, they could probably get it off the internet, even if they can not in libraries.  Therefore with today's technologies, censorship would not make a difference.     Next, there are ways to avoid children reading inappropriate books besides taking the books off the shelves completely.  For instance, if parents are so worried about their children reading inappropriate books, then they should take their kids to the library themselves and tell their kid what they can and can not read.  If parents do not censor what their child reads, then those parents MONTH1 want the child to read whatever heshe choses to.  If their parents chose to let their kid read the book, then that is their choice, not anybody elses.  The choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child.     Lastly, there are so many things in the world that could be offensive to other people besides a book.  For example, people offend other people all the time by words they say.  People hear about all of the fighting because the person probably was offended by something someone else said.  Also there is the television.  The television has inappropriate shows on it all the time, yet everyone can have access to it if they chose to.  Plus there are shows on television that could have to do with racism, or someone being overweight.  These things offend people every day.  Therefore, we should not take books off the shelves just because there is a possiblity of offending someone, when a person could be offended by so many other things in the world rather than a book.     In conclusion, the books, magazines, and movies of the library should not be taken off the shelves away from the public just because they are not appropriate for some children.  Eighteen year olds are adults who should be able to chose whatever they want.  Plus if parents are worried about their child reading inappropriate books, then they can monitor that themselves.  Also, people are offended every day by other people, so books, magazines, and movies are not the only things in the world that could be offensive.  If the person thinks a movie or book is offensive to them, then do not check it out!  Not everything in our lives has to be controlled by someone, so people should lighten up and give some freedom of choice.",0
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems when tempting to let dirigbles dock there. There were NUM1 major problems of why it was so hard to dock them at the Empire State building. These obstacles were what was in the dirigbles, the ""nature"" of winds around New York, and a new law passed on restrictions of airships.     Dirigbles unlike balloons, which are made up of Helium, dirigbles are made up of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamible. This coud have resulted in terrible way if anything caught on fire since New York is so highly densed.     Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. They were constantly shifting, so they thought to tie the dirigibles down with lead but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell it would injure many people.     Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict than the dirigibles wouldnt be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to the city.     In, conclusion there were many obstacles that the archtects dont think about before constructing.",0
"THE CAPS1  A couple of weekends ago me and my cusin were at my grandmas house. She lives up in the woods and has a bunch of quads and motorcycles. All me and my cusin did was ride,have airsoft gun wars, and build giant forts. We planned on only staying one night but ended up staying three.   So the first night we were there we built a fort out in the woods. The fort seemed really good at the time, but the next morning we had other ideas. So the next morning we were getting ready to go outside and work on the fort. He got done before me so he went down there first. By the time I got half way down there I heard him scream and come running out of the fort. He was yelling CAPS2 .....MICCCCEEEEE! So i figued we must have a little CAPS2 problem and laughed to myself. So I walked in there to see for myself and sure enough there was a bunch of little CAPS2 running around in there. That was the end of forts on the ground for us.  The next day we decided to have airsoft wars(guns that shoot little plastic bb's). We were having alot of fun shooting eachother mainly because it hurt. Like I said we were having alot of fun until I decided to try and hid up in a little tree. He found me and shot me I fell out of the tree and broke my gun. That was the end of the wars plus I almost broke my leg. I guess that was payback for laughing about the mouse thing.  After the wars ending we decided to go ride quads for a while. There are alot of trails around her house to ride on. He road a dirtbike and I rode a quad, I road a quad so I could make new trails. We made some really good trails up there. It was really muddy up there and very wet. While we were way out in the woods on a long ride I ran out of gas. So I had to walk all the way back to the house for gas then walk all the was back up there.  The last day we were up there we got up early. We wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort. This time we were going to make a tree fort so we didnt have to worry about critters. We spent from the time we got up till the time we went home on this awsome tree for. My granndpa has alot of wood that he dosn't use because he really to old to build anything so we never ran out of wood.",0
"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I think this, is because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic. They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want in to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. I would have never been able to learn evrything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of LOCATION4. Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. For example, my grandparents live in LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today.",0

"There are numerous books and movies which are deemed not appropriate for younger audiences. By marking movies with a rating, and marking books with a specific age group, it helps categorize them.      In our public libraries, all books and movies are settled into one place for everyone to have the ability to check out. There is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone. If a child were to check out a book, and it happened to be rated CAPS1, the parents would most likey become upset with the library for giving the right to the child to check out a rated CAPS1 movie. There is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a CAPS1 rating. In which the library would be harrassed for not letting the child check it out. Furthurmore, should public libraries let certain age groups check out moviesbooks which are not appropriate? The logical answer concludes to no, they shouldn't. If a child can not see a rated CAPS1 movie at the theatre, why should they be able to check them out freely at the library? Public libraries should invest in a way to keep underage kids from checking out inapropriate materials. By simply having their age on their library card, there would be a lot of misunderstandings taken care of.      Our public libraries should take it into their own hands, by changing their censorship. It would give them a better name, and give our children a secure place to gain access to these matirials.",0

"One time I was patient was in CAPS1 CAPS2. Guess NUM1s CAPS3!) CAPS4 was the DATE1. When we pulled up to the tickit booth the man in the little booth said tickit please. CAPS5 we pulled up to get a parking spot. I hen we got out & ran for the gates. But just then CAPS8 sister forgot her towel. CAPS5 I ran back to the truck & got CAPS4. Then we got into our bathing sutes. Then we went to the water. The first ride I did was the CAPS6 of CAPS7! MONTH1 I mind you CAPS4 was very scary. But I said, dose any one want to go with me? CAPS8 dad& CAPS8 moms friend from work said yes! CAPS5 we got in the line. The line was like NUM2 to NUM3 people in the line. CAPS5 the wait was around NUM4 hours! But I did not complain one bit. But then we heard a blood curtling scream from the ride. Then a man, women & NUM4 young kids got spit out into the pool. Then we got their tube & went up the stairs. We got up to the huge opening to where you could see the NUM6 foot dropoff then the brite pink & yellow funnle. About NUM7 minutes later we were at the port where you get on your tube. CAPS5 we went down. CAPS8 moms friend (PERSON1) went down backwards. I said yes, you go to go down backwards. Halla! CAPS5 we started going down & then we just dropped (well we freefalled) but we were going like NUM8 mph. CAPS4 was scary. Then we got sit out. Then I fell into the pool &got out. I scean CAPS8 mom & was two sisters. They laughed at PERSON1 because she was crying. Then she said she didnt feel good. CAPS5 she went to the truck & took a nap. Then I rode rides the rest of the TIME1. That is a time I was patient.",0
What l think the author was talking abount snow and it was add outside for the bays matter and snow started to melted.,0
A time when I was patient was yesterday when I finished the CAPS1 before a lot of people and was drawing for the next NUM1 minutes. I was patient throuout this time because if wasnt I mightve been very loud and disrupted my fellow classmates. I started to draw or color as some might say because instead of drawing a smiley face I colored in boxes on math graphing paper to make a sort of lime green and purple checker board. It took the entire time and I am still not done with it. That is a time I remember when I was quite patient.,0
"A  time that i was patient was when i had to train my dog. sit boy, I command to my puppy. My dog instead of sitting runs at me jump and grabs the treat out of my hand. I go and try to grab the treat back from him and he gulps it down. While CAPS1 walking  to grab his collar and take him for a walk he bolts away. After chasing him for hours he finally stops and looks at me waiting  to run again. CAPS2 here Im done chasing you lets just go for a walk, please, I say as i slowly loose my patience. I begin to walk toward him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolts again just leaving a bunch of dust behind. CAPS1 done ! I scream and walk away with anger. I begin to leave and go up the hill to my house. I go to my room ready to sleep. The next morning CAPS4 up and go outside to try and train dog.  I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off but today CAPS1 ready to work hard and keep my patience. CAPS6! I yell waiting  for my dog to CAPS2 running and he does.With my first command i tell the dog to sit and he does not so I dont give him the treat. I say it again and he sits! Finally some progress after that waiting. I give him the treat and he starts waging his tail. To see if he understood i say it again. He sat again and got another treat. After that work with my dog I begin to  ask him to do more things,sometimes he doesnt listen and some times he does. That was a  time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him and it definently paid off.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for it to be the tallest building in existance, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new top onto the building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building. The also needed to finds safe ways to dock the blimps. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a safety hazard in a big city. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to way down the ship. These problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite alot, so the mooring was never used to its full potential.",0
The authors purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return she will have to again take care of the plant. Thats clear because taking a test is a big responsibility therefore taking care of that plant is also a huge task refering  to taking the test again. this is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant.,0
"The author concludes the story with the main character vowing to take the drivers test again to symbolize moving forward.  Saeng felt a shock of recognition so inffuse, it was almost visceral. A  pone stumbling to a florist shop the main character sees a flower that reminded her of her home land, Vietnam. Here, let me help, mother. In relieving  her mother in the task of planting the seed that she had bought she began to mature. After reflecting on the memories of her past and coming to peace with there   there   was nothing left stoping   her from moving  forward. when   they come back  I will take that test again. As she sees   geese migrating south for the winter in a v formation she sets a goal for herself and uses that goal as a tool to help herself grow and move foward in the new country shes in. The main character vowing in Winter Hibiscus symbolizes moving   foward.",0
I think the author used that response because she was showing that she had to go through another DATE1 or hard work in planting flowers.,0
"While building the Empire State Building, Al Smith believed he had solved the problems of dirigibles having no where to land. However, having the building as a place for dirigibles to dock proved to be much harder than it seemed. First, the balloon would cause too much stress to the building's frame. The author states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (CAPS1 NUM1). Also, because this frame would need to be modified, a lot of money would need to be spent. The author states, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (CAPS1 NUM1). It was too risky to invest on such an unsure project. Also, they realized how dangerous any accidents could be over such a populated area. The author explains, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (CAPS1 NUM3). If anything had happened, a very large part of New York could have suffered. Although the plan of creating a mast for dirigibles was impressive, it was neither logical financially, or logical for saftey reasons.",0
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" at the end of the story the author writes ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again."" The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time In conclusion the author write the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life.",0
A time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when I was in NUM1 grade. When I was in NUM1 grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient. So once apon a time their was a girl named PERSON1 who was not patient so the hole world new her as the un patient. PERSON1 hated that name so she though to let self and she said CAPS1 CAPS2 I make them CAPS3 calling me that. So PERSON1 went around her street and asked everyone CAPS1 CAPS2 I CAPS3 being called the unpatient. NO body would tell her the answer so PERSON1 sceawed out loud CAPS1 CAPS2 I CAPS3 being called The unpatient.  Then PERSON1 heard a vocie it was an old man his name was CAPS4 and he's said I no CAPS1 you CAPS2 CAPS3 being called that way PERSON1 said CAPS1 please tell me. All you need to do is be patient. Then PERSON1 though to herself I got to be patient. So what PERSON1 did was she went to the store and you no what she did she got in line and she was patient so when everybody went they said good job PERSON1 and everybody stopped calling her unpatient.,0
"In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, This sight was troubling, he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, It didnt really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die.",0
"In this memoir about PERSON1 the reader learns alot about the CAPS1 by the mood (or tone) of the memoir. The mood of this memoir is greatful, because he is thinking of all the opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless.     In the memor the reader learns that parent makes so many sacrifices for their children that helping around the house and thanking them is the least they can do.      In conclusion the mood in the memoir Home: The CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is, happy, and greatful because of the sacrifices made by his parents. A good citation for this is ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""",0
"Cooling the CAPS1: CAPS2 and CAPS3 From Book PERSON1 _________     Censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution. A library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey. One point of a library, the destination of researchers, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety. Books are incapable of judgment.     To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress. A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the CAPS5, precludes the idea of this censorship.     If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same? To value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works.     From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life. Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless. When I visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little aid. Around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did I find a fairy tale of two princes. It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted. More insulting than finding books of CAPS4 issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately.     Here lies the problem. Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. Such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction. But books cannot shout their values. They cannot shove information down our throats. Books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge. Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance.     If my library had done its job and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown so much more easily. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well.     In the past few years, with the effects of CAPS5 CAPS6 CAPS7 reaching the newest generation, LOCATION1 has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of CAPS8 and of the CAPS9. What the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies. In trying construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of. The products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void. As such, architects have created what MONTH1 be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost. One of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows. Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning. We cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished. We must ask, what are we missing? What views, what prose, what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it?     This is the effect of library censorship. To remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame. Once it is gone, it will be forgotten. To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new. Let the reader decide its value. Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. Give the book a chance for it MONTH1 have a power that is unrealized. Leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom.",0
The mood of the author i think is caring; but then I also think it's calm. I think it is caring because of the way he talks about the neighbor-hood. I also think it's caring because he understood what was going on. But I think it is calm because the way the way that he speaks it's in a calm tone.,0
"These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody.",0
"I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that there can be both good and bad effects. Computers make things easier for people, but they are also too dependent on. Man-kind should use books for research also not just computers. Computers are very helpful for people. For example, if you really wanted to see a certain movie but you don't want to stand in line, people can go to movie tickets.com and purchase their tickets. Then, once you get to the movie theater, all that's left to do is walk over to the kiosk and redeem your tickets. Another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes. There is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer. Once the software has been installed, it will usually lead you, step by step, through the process of paying your bills. It's much faster and much easier than paying ""manually"". These are some really good effects that computers have on people. Computers also have their flaws. Over time, computers have caused most people to be lazy. Some people have become too dependant on their computers. Business owners, or businessmen and women in general, are CAPS2 on their laplops or blackberries. Everywhere you look there is another adult on the internet or e-mail. Not only adult's do this though. Students are becoming more dependant on the internet. For every assignment practically, students use google or bing. Sometimes they use or wikipedia. Students should just take the time to use their extbooks. The student body would rather watch CAPS3, play video games, or text than do homework. This is understandds because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end. Taking the extra NUM1 minutes to use a textbook won't kill anyone. No one has died yet from using a book instead of google. Also, in using a textbook, you will understand how to do whatever you're doing. That isn't so bad, is it? Computers, as you can see, have both good and bad effects. It's easy to use the internet for homework but that doesn't really help you. Making purchases is fun though. It saves gas money and time. I hope you and the readers of this paper see my point of view.",0
"In the short story, Rough Road Ahead, the cyclist faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of setting. I believe it has a big affect. The setting is in a dessert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a dessert. CAPS1 thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. CAPS1 setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a dessert traveling many miles.",0
"Personally I don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should be selling any of the items just mentioned. If they are found offensive to the public. I think it offends lots of people. Citizens such as senior citizens and children shouldn't have to be exposed to inaproppriate material. I think in order to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines you should have to be at least eight-teen years of age. The economy is bad enough the way it is. There is a new generation of people who are being raised at the moment, and they should't have to look back at their childhood and have memories of seeing offensive movies, or reading offensive books and magazines.      I think music is what influences a person the most. If they are constantly listening to foul language and what not, that is going to just stay into a persons mind. I know this from experience. I also believe that movies influence a peron lot too. For example, a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it. Well after he is done watching the movie he thinks to himself, 'well it must be okay to kill someone because i saw someone kill another person because they got away with it and never got into trouble.' That is just one example of how the humans mind can change.     In conclusion I do believe that humans have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want. I just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though. Also, I think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library. So that  just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending",0
"Censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact of so many opinions being conveyed through all the new medias in the modern world. When a person has a veiw they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it againts those who opose their opinion. Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented, thus causing the government, or any authority, to remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public. This is censorship and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media.     I believe censorship is wrong. It violates the CAPS1 peoples' rights of free speach. When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it anyway they want. The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in anyway. Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts.     Who is to say what can and can't be said? Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal? Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate? No. We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media. If a person does not like what they see then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way; but they do not have the right to opress. They should write back, convey their message and try to win support, not control.     Censorship is not good for any society. People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to. Censorship is not a solution to discrimation or anger, it is only a fuel. If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it then do not take it from them, then they should tell them how it is 'wrong' and give them their opinion and reasons so the child MONTH1 descide what they believe in on their own. An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities.",0
I believe he used this as the ending to ensure that she was strong and she would do whatever it took to perservere.,0
The reason the author of Winter hibiscus ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end  of a moderatly depressing story. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving foreward.  And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end.,0
I think she concluded with this statement because she doesnt know if she will pass but she isnt giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad and the plant helped to cheer her up so when she sees the plant next year she wants to take the test.The plant is like a sign of good luck. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves you with the idea not to give up when times are hard keep trying.,0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how she will start over by retaking the test, just as the hibiscus will start over by budding new flowers. Saeng shows us how she will try to overcome the obstacles she must face, just like the hibiscus flower and geese will overcome the winter. In the story, the author makes the hibiscus represent the way to adjust to the changes in life. In a way, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng because the flower is adapting to circumstances, the circumstance being winter. Just like the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome her obstacles of being in a new country, and retaking her drivers exam.",0
"The mood that was created by the author was respect. For example it told the boy that you don't have to be a blood realative. For instance, the author states ""CAPS1 up in this environment in stilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". Another reason, was that you should always help your family s during bad times. For example the book reads ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporilily until they were able to get back on their feet"". Thirdly, the boy will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. For instance the auother quotes ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.",0
"In the essay, Rough Road A head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First of all, he was traveling in the CAPS1 which means it was very dry. This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was biking in the heat. This meant that he was continuesly sweating which also depleted his water from his body and played tricks on his mind. Finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the setting affected him emotionally. Overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him.",0
I think the author is just trying to show that you never give up. I think the author is trying to show the beautie of nature. The author used that because in the story Saeng failed the test but at the end it says that she will take the test again. In the story it talks about the winter hibiscus that she planted and that is concluded in the conclusion. The conclusion basiclly saying is there will be a new beginning.,0
Builders of the empire state building faced many different things while trying to build a dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to make sure it was safe to walk on the platform to get off the blimps. Also the dock had to be high so the owner could still keep the world's highest building record. But with a little hat added wasn't going to do much so building a dock was a better idea.,0
"The architects of the Empire State building ran into many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One of the main causes was nature. Windsair current was a big risk. ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shall..."" (CAPS1 NUM1). This was a problem that no one could fix, no one can controll wind. Another big impact in the bunch of the mooring mast was law. ""The other practical reason why the dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (CAPS1 NUM1). This law would make it impossible to ever make it a full use of transportation. These obstacles architects couldn't overcome, and the original idea for the project was soon forgotten.",0
I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasnt it for the little girl and she wasnt going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didnt work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesnt work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.,0
"I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclists state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it is summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early DATE1. And third he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together. He was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These NUM1 things all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough.",0

"The Benefits of Laughter Laughter has always been a major part of my life. Most of the relationships that I have with my friends are great , because i can make them laugh and cheer them up when they feel down. When a person laughs it makes them completely forget about anything that brought them down, and now they just focus on what made them laugh and feel that joy and happiness. When you laugh , the only thing on your mind is the thing that made you laugh, nothing else. laughter in many cases has brought people from an absolute low self-esteem to a high self-esteem in a very short amount of time. An example in where laughter was very beneficial to a person happened with one of my friends. One of my good friends seemed to be really down and didn't want to talk about what was going on with anyone. With him not telling anyone what was wrong it kind of leaves you guessing, what could have happened? After about a week of pretty much isolating himself from others, he was ready to talk and hang out with some of his close friends, which included me. Me, and two other people that were friends with me and him, decided to go golfing which was a new hobby of ours. It was that day that he told us how his mom was cheating on his dad for over a year, and how she was also hiding alcohol in all different kinds of places. and was over-drinking.  By him just being around his friends, laughing and having a good time, he found himself focusing on other things other than what was going wrong in his life. Even laughing at yourself can be a good way of coping with your problems. even when there seems that nothing will go right in your life, something always will, you just have to give it time. The moral of the story that i have just told is that no matter how sad you feel, laughter can always help ease the pain. Even laughing about a bad situation could help you to feel better.",0
"When I was adopted, I didn't know what to expect. Thoughts ran through my mind of what the CAPS1 and CAPS2 were like, what the home was like, and if they would like me or not. I was told I was going to have two new sisters named PERSON2 and CAPS3. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black ORGANIZATION3 CAPS4 my heart began to pound harder and harder at the passing of every street, coming closer each second to the home that I would soon be able to call my own. Approaching the driveway I saw a well laid out, one story blue house. The door was opened by a really tall well built man, who appeared to just have gotten off of work. He was very welcoming and said his name was CAPS5, as he invited me in I was greeted by a white pit bull whose name was CAPS6. To the right was a girl with short hair who was a little bit taller than little five foot three inch me, whose name was CAPS3. I was a year older than her though, so I saw it as a fun thing to have a little sister. At first I didn't notice she was observing me and then finally when I did notice, she gave me a really big smile exposing her beautiful straight teeth. When I met CAPS1 who said her name was PERSON1, I automatically felt this warm feeling of acceptance right away. She was also a little bit taller than me, and was very pretty. They told me that I would be meeting PERSON2, my older sister the following DATE1 because she was attending college in LOCATION1 at ORGANIZATION1. We stood in the kitchen and talked a little bit trying to get to know the basics about each other. I became very talkative as little electric currents of anxiety drifted through my body. We talked about our interests for a while, and then I finally asked them what the rules were. The response I got was quite different than what I thought I was going to get. I learned that they have never had to ground any of the girls, the only thing that I should make sure to do is simply respect everyone in the household. Finally CAPS2 decided it was time for the grand tour of the home. My room was a bed room that at the moment was being used as a storage room, so I had to stay with CAPS3 in her room for a few weeks until CAPS2 could get all of the things taken out into a shed he was going to built outside in the back yard. The continuous rain kept him from being able to do anything outside, so instead he built a desk for the computer that would fit in the bay window next to the kitchen. Since plan A didn't work out for my room, CAPS1 ended up having the office be converted into my room and the bay window area was converted into an office space for CAPS2 to be able to run his business. Each week that passed I began to feel more comfortable, my favorite part of the day was dinner because CAPS1 was a really great cook. CAPS1 would take me to counseling sessions to make the transition into the family an easy one. I have never had any one put my needs first before, and it made me feel loved for once in my life. It was always really easy to talk to CAPS1 and CAPS2, but I would always find it a little bit harder to talk to CAPS3. I was always worrying about saying too much or not saying enough, even not being able to say the right thing at the right time. Trying to connect with my sister was a challenge for me. I wanted to get to know what her interests were, but she would constantly be with her friends or be doing her homework.  It wasn't until my ORGANIZATION1 was having a CAPS18 CAPS19 fundraiser that we decided to go. She invited her friend PERSON3 and I went along to pay for their ice cream. When we arrived and got our ice creams we all sat down at a table when all of a sudden, ORGANIZATION2's ORGANIZATION1 friends show up and decide to leave CAPS3. I see the hurt in CAPS3's stare right away, so I began to tell her a funny story of something that had happened to me. After I was done we laughed and then she replied with a story of her own. We kept talking back and forth in a reciprocal conversation, and without realizing it we were really enjoying ourselves. It wasn't until later that week when I went to see the counselor that I learned laughter brings people together and connects them in ways one cannot imagine. To this day CAPS3 and I are really close, and we even prank each other now. I love my little sister CAPS3.",0
"Someone once told me that laughter is the key element of comfort. I believe that CAPS7 is one of the most important part of any relationship. CAPS7's what brings people together. A perfect example; about two years ago in the middle of fall, I was crying about my dog passing away. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better but nothing was working. I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoonSpongebob CAPS1, when ORGANIZATION1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help CAPS7. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a promblem, we could always laugh CAPS7 off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie calledStep-CAPS2. There was this one seen where one of the characters said, ""CAPS3 CAPS3 that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur,"" then other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend PERSON1 suggested that we go back to his house. When we got there, CAPS4 was waiting on the steps for PERSON1. PERSON1 stood back a second then said, ""aw were you waiting for me little one."" CAPS4 replied with, ""CAPS3 CAPS3 that was so funny , last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur."" I laughed so hard I almost went the bathroom on myself. CAPS4 and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him. I love laughter. I believe CAPS7's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions.",0
"I believe that censorship should be allowed when it comes to certain things but I don't believe censorship belongs in public libraries.  Books are wrote to stimulate the imagination of a persons mind and if they cannot read books that are the slightest offensive, then they will never know what it is like to open some of the greatest books ever wrote until that person has grown up.  And there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics.     For example, a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature.  So heshe goes to the public library to find a good book, but when that student gets the heshe finds out that all pieces of classical literature have been removed from the library due to being overly offensive.  What would that person do?  Should heshe just give up because every single piece of classical literature has been taken out of every library in the country, I say no!       This is a problem because almost every great book ever wrote has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader.  From personal experience I can back this statement up with books I have read going through my school career.  For example, when I was in the NUM1 grade  was assigned a book report over PERSON1, so I went to our library in the school to look for this book and it was nowhere to be found.  I asked the librarian where this book was and she said that it had been removed due to being offensive to the black population for having the word negro inprinted on its pages.  So I asked her if I could go tot the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well.  I did not know what to do, I was completely clueless and I had no book to write my report over.  So eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not on student was able to find PERSON1.  But if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves then we would not have had this problem.     Another example was when my friend PERSON2 wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from.  But when he got to the library he could not find any books over the arabic world.  So he asked the librarian 'where are all the books covering LOCATION3, LOCATION2, and LOCATION1?'  And the librarian said that they were all removed because after NUM2 CAPS1 saw arabs as very offensive people and that no books were left unchecked.  I'm sure that he found this comment to be very offensive but there was nothing that he could do about it because the white people found arabs to be offensive and unequal to the white race.     These are only a few things that have already happened becaue of people finding certain books to be offensive, which is why I believe that the government should leave all the books on the shelves and let the people decide to pick up that book or pass it by.  Sure people have a freedom of speech but it should not effect what books belong on the shelf.  Which is why I believe that censorship should not be allowed to effect libraries of the public.",0
"Over time, libraries have been used as a big resource when doing reports, researching, renting movies and simply trying to find something new to read. They have been used as a gate way for an extensive world of reading and learning. All libraries should have the right to have the content they please to have on thier shelves. No book, music, movie, magazine , etc., should ever be denied a place on the shelve because of it's content.         Sex, drugs, violence. There are many books over these topics that many people MONTH1 find offensive or just completely oblivious. Every mind is diffrent when it comes down to what it likes to read, watch or hear. No mind is the same, so no mind will ever like exactly the same thing. When ever someone wants to go buy a book about safe sex, it should not be denied to them because the library does not allow it. It should be placed on a different section of the library.           Many books that people find as explicit content to them, MONTH1 not be to others. When i was in middle school, i heard alot about sex, and drugs. I never knew what it felt like or how did it feel. What i did know was that I could get accesible information from my local library. What happens when a child wants to know more than she does? She looks, and researches it. If i would have been denied the access to books about sex or drugs, I would have probabaly never been warned about the out comes or the seriousness of them both. When you walk into a libraby and observe. Not everyone is reading a book about rainbows, and unicorns. Many people read books about the real life, books that they can relate to. Many of those books that many people read are those that others calls explicit. The purpose of a library is to have access to books, magazines, music, and movies of all kind of content, reguardless of others concerns.            Also, Libraries can do many things so that certain contents MONTH1 not be near others. They can organize there topics and genres. Explicit, or eighteen or older books, movies, magazines or music MONTH1 be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library. Far from the reach where kids and children are able to access.            In conclusion I believe with my strongly supportive ideas that books, magazines,  music or movies should not be removed if found offensive because every book has a right on the shelve no matter what. No book should be removed because someone MONTH1 find it offensive. If a person finds something offensive they should take it up with the author or publishers not the library for they only let people borrow the conten",0
"Those eyes, it was like I was looking out into a warm carribean sunset with a flash of green while relaxing on the beach without a care in the world. Her skin was kissed by the sun and flawless in every way. Those lushes ruby red lips looed about as juicy and refreshing as the taste of a freshly picked pink lady apple. From the moment she sat down across from me i couldve sworn i was dreamin. How can any woman look so perfect and exist outside of a movie or game? Thats all i could think of, thats all i wanted to imagine. Just me and her together, but the thought of it was to great to come true I couldnt find a way to bridge this gap i felt between us. Neither of us had ever met or seen each other before and yet still i couldnt resist. it was like when adam was presented with the golden apple from eve. That smile, perfectly straight teeth with that sparkling shine that could blind anyone without sunglasses. Thats when she inally spoke and said ""CAPS1 you know the answer to number three?"". I was stunned by her voice. It reminded me of a thousend violins played by angels. my mouth droped and all I could say was ""nope"". I was a complete mook nothing more then a hoser, but then i noticed she was wearing a cross to match her outfit. So I attempted to redeem myself with ""thats an amzing cross ur wearing, what kind of gem is that in the cnter?"". She smiled and batted her eyelashes and told me ""thank you, I like your cross too. mine has a ruby in it"". I smiled back then i got a text message from my friend wth a new joke he wanted me to hear. As I read it I started to burst out laughing. The angel in front of me was then curiouse to what I was laughing about. When i finally finished the joke she too bursted out laughing and I finally gave myself a proper intruduction and told her my name. She was smiling fom ear to ear after the laugh we sared and she told me her name was ""CAPS2"". Ah CAPS2 surly it had to be a name given to angels. To this day I still thank my friend who gave me that joke, because if I had not made her laugh then we probably wouldnt have gotten to know each other. If we had not gotten to know each other then she probably wouldnt be my girlfriend. To this day I still feel like the luckiest man in the world and if fate see's fit to split us apart then I will always remember that laughing is the best way to get to know someone.",0

"Laughter brings the world together in a way that cannot be put into words. When two people laugh together over the same thing, a special bond is made that is like no other. There is no way to describe the connection and how it can build a relationship. Every person on this LOCATION2 will hopefully experience the bond that laughter brings. Last DATE2, I was a member of a select lacrosse team and I didn't know any of the girls there. The team had five practices before the tournament and by the third practice, I still hadn't talked to many girls there. I was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team. At the fourth practice, we were all stretching in a circle and I made a comment to one of the girls and she laughed. We began talking and throughout the rest of that practice, we talked and became friends. By making her laugh I had made a friend on the team and was even more excited for the upcoming tournament. The final practice was cut short so that the team could create tie-dye t-shirts to wear at the tournament. I sat down with PERSON2, the girl I had become friends with at the previous practice, and her friend PERSON1 came over to sit with us on the concrete. We all began talking and laughing with each other. Our shirts were tied with rubber bands and we were ready to put the dye onto them. We were laughing and making a mess of the multiple colors, having a good time and enjoying the warm night. As we finished our shirts and put the sopping wet clothing into plastic bags, we walked to the parking lot and said our goodbyes. I now had two friends on the team and could not wait to leave for the tournament that DATE1. On a DATE1 TIME1, I woke up at NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in LOCATION1, OR. We were all meeting there to load our things into the three large white vans and to drive up as a team. I crawled into the van wearing my tie-dye t-shirt to see some of the girls looking tired and also sporting the tie-dyed shirts. PERSON1 and PERSON2 were in the back with another girl in between them so I sat in the row ahead of them. Some more girls from the team crammed into the van and we were on our way. During the NUM2 NUM3 hour car ride we slept, laughed and told stories. After being stuck in the car together for so long, we all bonded with each other over laughter and story telling. We each came from different cities, schools and backgrounds which made for a very entertaining car ride.  At the tournament, PERSON1, PERSON2 and I all stuck together. We walked around the fields, ate meals and laughed together almost the whole time. The only time we were apart was when roomates were assigned and we were not put in a room together. We all worked together as a team towards a common goal, winning games and making it to the championship. All of the girls on that team bonded in some way and even now, most of us are still in contact with each other.  Laughter is what brought PERSON2 and me together and the rest of the team followed. The entire team bonded over laughter and we all became more comfortable with each other through laughing and having a good time. Putting NUM4 girls together from entirely different cities could have been a major disaster, but we connected with each other by making other laugh, making it a positive experience for all involved. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another human through laughter is an experience that everyone should have, it is so unique and powerful that friendships built on laughter can last a lifetime. Laughter makes the world a little better, a little brighter, and united together as one.",0
"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perserverance. Saeng states, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.""

"CAPS1 I believe that people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer because they do less exercising, they don't interact with friends and family, and its bad for their health. People shouldn't spend so much time. They wont enjoy their life outside of their houses. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that its bad for their health. Spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes. Some people with seizures including myself would trigier an attack and cause us to space out. Spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body. To me thats very unhealthy. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends. On the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time. You would forget to say hi and how are you to your family. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ingnore you and think that you don't care about them. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your soical activitys with other people. My final reason why spending to much time on the computer is bad is that your not enjoying nature. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer. Yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself. Being on the computer to much will make you not want to exerise and that won't be good for your body. You would forget to at least go for a jog, discover new thing. You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it. Those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad. Its not health. You don't interact will your friends or family. Also you won't enjoy nature for yourself. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you.",0

He also states, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close  knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants, who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That shows that he is grateful to have friends and family. Also, the mood is caring.

"What should and should'nt be censored in a library really is just a matter of opinion from the people using the library. If everyone were to removed what they didnt like from the shelves of a library then much information would be less acceceble to the general public. Although some people MONTH1 be offended by some forms of literature, this doesnt mean that the literature should be removed from everyone. I beleive a solution must be made to satisfy everyone.     Currently, some people arent happy with some of the books, music, movies, and magazines that are available at many libraries. They believe that the information MONTH1 be unsuitable for some veiwers. Some people just do not want certain information getting in the minds of children.     While that is a very solid reason to censor what goes into our libraries; there are others who dissagree with the thought of censoring our libraries. By allowing the censoring of libraries it would decrease the amount of information available to the public. If parents allow their children to take out certain materials without first checking whats behind the cover, then the parents have noone to blame but themselves.     I believe that this could all be resovled by simply having parents fill out a form before allowing their children to get a library card. This form would include a list of things that they would want to prevent their kids from checking out such as: swearing in books and music, nudity in movies and magazines. This information would be put with the cerial number of the library card. If their child were to checkout something that is restricted on the list, the librarian would tell them to put the book back and pick another book.     I can see how censorship is very useful and important. Although sometimes it can be takin a bit to the extreme. There is a solution out there, but we just need to find it.",0

I would hate to live like that, and I hate to live like that, and I know my peers would agree. This is just one ORGANIZATION3 many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reaasons include, citizens ORGANIZATION3 the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as a ORGANIZATION3 would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First ORGANIZATION3 all, think about the schools that the ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, typing to write as quickly as possible.

Also, students use computers for research; learning about different parts ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you CAPS1 say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think ORGANIZATION3 yourself calling your best friend who lives in LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer.

You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot ORGANIZATION3 my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locatiions makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some ORGANIZATION3 your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When CAPS2 five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part ORGANIZATION3 everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a possible effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens ORGANIZATION3 the world. I'm you, a ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION3, needs a computer to work. Although I CAPS1 see why some people MONTH1 oppose to computer, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People MONTH1 think computers MONTH1 cost too much, but you CAPS1 find them for they almost any price range.

"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon CAPS1 she describies the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obsticles they faced where there was a lack of suitble landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building the obsticles too face were to great for the builders with the lack of a sutible landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law agianst aircrafts flying to low.",0

"How would you feel if you wrote a story about your life, and someone found it offensive, so the took the book off of the shelves? I feel as if the censorship in libraries is becoming a controversial problem for the following reasons: it is wrong to take away freedoms, people have different opinions and views, and some books, magazines, or songs are trying to make people aware of dangers.     One important aspect in why censorship is becoming controversial is; it takes away our freedom of speech. In LOCATION1, we have the right to speak our minds. If everything we read was censored, there would be nothing to read. The liberties and freedoms of CAPS1 citizens should not be taken away because of something that is thought to be inappropriate.     Another reason why I believe censorship is wrong is; different people have completely different opinions on things. One person might feel that a book about a sexual assault victim is offensive, while another person might think the book is informational and helpful. No one can base censorship on one belief or idea, because it will never be the belief or idea that everyone approves of.      A third reason why censorship should not be inforced as much is; it takes away the awarness of the dangers in everyday life. Stories about people who were kidnapped, or were in a car crash because the person who was driving was under the influence of drugs, can be a good thing. Eventhough the story MONTH1 have some accounts that are not appropriate, it could be very influencial, and convince someone to make the right choice. If we censor stories about abduction, drugs, alcohol, or people making the wrong choices, no one will be able to read a story about it and make the right choice instead of making the same mistake as the person.        Although stories or magazine articles that MONTH1 be seen as vulgar are looked down upon, they help to make people aware, give people the freedom of speech, and allow them to have their own opinions. Censorship in libraries and media should be abolished",0
The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. Being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.,0
"CAPS1 you know that more than half the students in the world use the computer to study. I think that people don't spend a lot of time on the computer. And even if they are it's for studying learning of catching up with old friends. Here are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. Most kids use computers to learn about things they are doing in class. And they also use the computer to study about a country or a person they are doing a report on. Also there are games on the computer that can help you with math. Now onto my secod reason. You can also use the computer to send emails to friends that live faraway, and also you could use things like facebook to find friends that had moved away. And you could also use a video camera to video chat with a friend or if you are a business man or woman you could videochat with clients all across the country. Now onto my third and final reason. Computers also have applications like microsoft word which lets you type things such as essays or term papers instead of having to write them out by hand. Also there is an application that lets you make a powerpoint if you need to make one for a project. And there is an application that lets you paint pictures or draw pictures. Those are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. If we didn't have computers the world would be very different like kids wouldn't be able to search things for projects or type essays. And you wouldn't be able to keep contact with someone who moved away. Also you wouldn't be able to make power points for projects. And that is why I think computers have a good effect on people.",0

"The CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter, one of the best feelings an individual can achieve. When you're feeling sad, angry, or in an argument, laughing can turn any negative feelings into good ones. Though you MONTH1 not want to show the turn of emotion, it is very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it be a chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it completely changes one's mood. Laughing with someone is even better still. Having laughter-filled relationships is an important element to someone's well being. Sharing a CAPS3 is a great way to start friendships and keep them thriving. Relationships without laughter soon end. It is almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to CAPS3 together. Laughter is something that needs to be exposed in relationships often. Without it, there is no connection, joy, or excitement. There is no common ground if you're unable to CAPS3 with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter bonds people together at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled ""I CAPS2 to CAPS3."" I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever that video is brought up we have a great time reminiscing about those days. Being able to CAPS3 together has brought my family relationships to the highest point. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, but it is contagious.  Laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is very hard not to CAPS3 when someone else is laughing. Everyone has their own CAPS3 too. Sometimes, it is someone's CAPS3 that provokes laughter within the group. Making others CAPS3 is a wonderful feeling as well. Comedians make a career out of making people CAPS3. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone CAPS3. PERSON1 is one of my personal favorite comedians. I CAPS2 his style and the way he sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people CAPS3. All of one's friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher. However, the laughter shouldn't come from making fun of someone. It should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group MONTH1 be facing. That is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies of how laughter can heal the body. Such things as laughter therapy is a very real treatment for troubled individuals. Norman CAPS4' book, ""Laughter is the best medicine"" explains the powers of laughter in detail. CAPS4 watched The CAPS5 CAPS6 and laughed himself to wellness. He shows how one needs laughter to be well. Laughter is so very important to a person's health. It raises the spirits and lightens moods. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if one doesn't have enough laughter in his life, he MONTH1 not be as healthy as he could be. If your friendships are lacking humor, seek it. Laughter is one of the most important feelings that one needs to surround themselves with throughout their entire life.",0

"During 1929 when Al Smith announced that he was going to make a docking port for blimps at the top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles in the way of the architects building design. Building a dock for blimps at the top of the worlds tallest building is no easy task. They should have realized previous to the project that this was a lost cause, but they tried it anyways.The architects on the project had to devise a plan that would strengthen the main support beams of the building while still being able to control the movements of the back of the dirigibles due to uncontrolable wind conditions. Unfortunatly they never found a way to successfully complete this task and because of that the Empire State Building could never dock blimps.",0

"Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their ""computer-time"". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! How could so much knowledge be named unhealthy, or have a negative effect on people? Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive informatiion. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well-used social networking websites, such as CAPS1 or CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe, you can find long-lost friends or out-of-touch family members and instantly catch up. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you ""report' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. If you know how to use it right, you'll enjoy messages from family or instant messages from friends. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video-sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites where you can purchase music ang movies, or even clothes and furniature. Many stores have online websites wher you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for isntant entetainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your ""computer-time"" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit. Without it, it's just plain weird spending all day on a computer. So have fun! Learn, communicate, entertain youself.",0
"In a library it's censorship should be conrtolled by the people that go to that library. If it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf. The libraries should not take books off the shelf due to the beliefs of one person, no the libraries should take all the books and give them a rateing once they have that only the reader should decide if the book, music, movies, magazines, etc, are offensive to them.     Of course there are some books that adults MONTH1 not wish their child to read and then they should talk to the librarian and set a boundry of what rateing of book their child can check out. Organizing the books this way anbody can read anything they want to though there are the books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf, they need to stop a minute and realize that one of the books they like someone else might not want on the shelf.     In the end the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books. so to prevent a power struggle this way a comittee should be set up to decide what books to purchase. you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book, but those people will just have to deal with it.     The books on the libraries banned book list should be in the libray also, the books are just books weather you read them or not is your choice. The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the schools money purchasing the books the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library.     In short my veiw of book censorship is that, the library will choose the books that go into the library. To make things easier the books should have a rateing system that would be the national standard for all public libraries. Like I stated previously the books are just books its your choice to read them",0

"ORGANIZATION1, In the DATE1 computers have help man kinds. Computers are every where in a schools, homes band business across a CAPS1. They help people in many ways depending on the what the person wants to set done. The ways that I use my computer is by staying in contact with my friends, a family, and it also helps me with my school work. I have been a live for NUM1 DATE1 and have already live in NUM2 different states: LOCATION3, LOCATION1, LOCATION2, and now CAPS2 you would think I would have had lots of friends living in so many places. How do I stay in contact with them you MONTH1 use? I use various and CAPS3. If you get rid of computers I would not be able to stay in contact with tem anymore. Moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me. Another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family, but thank to technology and computers I stay in contact with them. Imagine you haven't seen you family in NUM3 DATE1, well sadly thats my life so many birthday CAPS4 all the family you can see is you parents. School another great example where society benefits from computers students and teachers use them everyday to learn. In my opoion learning is the greatest thing. One of my friends, PERSON1, said this about the dell computers we use in the library CAPS4 ever u don't get something about what we learned in CAPS5 class that day. I use the computers to better understand it. Computers are a great way to research a topic, and thats why they should not be gotten rid of. I use computers every day for two reasons for school, researching or writing a project for any of my classes. Everyday I spend at least NUM4 our writing something up for school. Computers help lessen the time spend writing it because it is fast and easy it is easy to type something, like a CAPS6 paper on the ways to persuassive the readier. In the end computers are something we I need in are life because it makes life simpler. If I was to send a message to some of my friends in LOCATION2 through CAPS7 it would take seconds. Instead if I was to use the ORGANIZATION2 it would take days. A life with out computers is a lot harder to do things, that we cant make simpler with computers""",0
"The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he cant find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find towns nearby. Once he finds them, they are either ghost towns or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the CAPS2. He says At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all.

"The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is very loving, grateful, and warm. Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is very endearing and clearly expresses the love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (CAPS1 NUM1). This definitely shows how much he loved his family, home, and friends, and how they taught him how to care for and love others. It brings a great feeling of lovingness this to the reader. Another large contributor to the mood of the story is the gratefullness Narciso feels to have grown up in such a wonderful home. The memoir states, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (CAPS1 NUM2). You can almost feel how grateful he is for is happy childhood and the selflessness of his parents through the writing. Finally, there is a warmth that contributes heavily to the mood of the memoir. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (CAPS1 NUM3). Narciso has become a better person because of the warmth and involvement in his home and, like the warmth formed the backdrop of his life it also forms the backdrop for the mood of the memoir.",0
"Laughter CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 Laughter I believe can snatch me out of the awful crater which I hide away in. It creates a bubble of joy in the pit of CAPS1 stomach, and it finally bursts joy throughout me. Laughter feels like a DATE1 day hearing the bugs hum with the warm breeze, and knowng I am able to float up into the cotton candy clouds, then not realizing I'm laughing at everything I do. Laughter flips CAPS1 gloomy days upside down, and makes me realize every reason I have to be happy. Sixth grade is a big mile stone in everyone's CAPS2. Getting lockers, having more freedom, being able to be around older kids, and so much more. I always had a dream of laughing with CAPS1 old best friend and giving boys our numbers, except it all changed when she moved away. No one talked to me or hung out with me at school. CAPS1 old best friend never left CAPS1 side no matter what, so it was uncomfortable walking thruogh the crammed hallways of a huge school with just air breezing by me.  School became unpleasent to go to everyday for eight hours. Most sixth graders don't like school because of the homework and would rather social with other classmates, but not me. I felt alone when other sixth graders (mainly girls), made jokes about CAPS1 appearence or how I always got good grades in school. They would steal the projects that I made and worked really hard on. They also took books, papers, and supplies like pencils and pens. I learned new formulas and facts, but never did I learn how to socialize with other peers. Three quarters went by of CAPS1 sixth grade year and I felt alone like suddenly the rest of the world shriveled up and died, or moved far far away. At night, CAPS1 eyes would spew gallons of salt water tears down CAPS1 face splashing CAPS1 pillows. PERSON1 was CAPS1 other best friend and never teased me or talk behind CAPS1 back, but she stuck to the people who did. It overwhelmed me walking near the group of girls who would put other people down, but hid it with their cartain acts around specific people. They would tell other students rumors about innocent people and how gross and weird they were. I didn't want them telling people rude comments about me, so I ignored them the best I could by doing activities on CAPS1 own. A girl from the other elementary school noticed CAPS1 loneliness at school and decided to talk to me. I was shy and felt CAPS1 stomach starting to do flips which was never a good sign. All I could do before I looked like a scared kitten was smile and nod. She told me that next lunch I should come hang out with her and her friends, but those girls were the girls who teased me. The next lunch I went with her feeling sweaty-hand nervous the entire time. Once I started talking to them about myself they just smiled and said I was adorable and a really awesome person, which made me smile from cheek to cheek. It felt good to smile for the first time in a long time. A couple of days later, the girls told other sixth graders I was a goody two-shoes that is so dreadfully boring. CAPS1 smile faded quickly once I heard those rumors that spread through CAPS1 class like a disease. PERSON1 left the group of girls one day at lunch to talk to me about what had happened. I told her how I felt about what those girls did to me and how it felt like the world always would agree with whatever they said. She confessed to me that she truly didn't know why she was hanging out with them in the first place. I was relieved to hear her say those words and for her to not agree with what that group was saying about me.  The girls who talked bad about me behind CAPS1 back were left to do whatever they desired, while PERSON1 filled the breezy air by CAPS1 side with laughter. Together we laughed at everything that amused us. Sometimes we would even laugh at each other during boring assemblies or at a ridiculous person attempting an act that everyone knows they cannot do. When she had a bump in the road in CAPS2 I supported her and did what a true friend would and just laughed at how dumb the other person was being just to make her laugh at the situation. In other words laughter pulled me out of CAPS1 awful pit I hid away in and made me find CAPS1 true friends in CAPS2. Laughing has made me forget bad times and people, and has made me realize when they bring me down I have a million reasons to laugh until I have to gasp for a sip of air. Laughter has been a huge part of any relationship for me because I can have an enjoyable time.",0
"Why should books that some people enjoy to read be removed off of library shelves?  That is ludacris. There are so many alternatives then to just take those certain books off the shelves completely.     We all have seen or heard of books that are inapropriate to certain audiences.  It is understandable that young children should not read or be associated with these kind of materials such as: books, magazines, poems, movies, songs.  It is totally unnecessary for children to be reading such explicit material, but it is possible for us to prevent it.       One way libraries throughout the nation can prevent this is by making a complete different libraries or have the explicit materials be located in the total opposite side of the library from the children's materials.  I know that libraries tend to have opposite corners of the library dedicated to adult materials and childrens materials, but there should be more strict rules of kids being in the adult section.       Another idea is to have parental permission on the child's own library card telling the librarian, when the child checks out a book, where in the library they can get a book.  For example maybe the childs' parents only will allow himher to get materials from the children's section in the library; therefore if that child wants a material from a different area of the library they cannot get it, unless hisher parents are their telling the librarian the child is allowed to get it.       I know when i was a child and i couldn't do something that my parents were doing, it made me feel upset, but now that i look back i realize why they wanted me not to do what they were doing.  They wanted me to be a child as long as possble.  They knew if i was reading or listening inapropriate materials then i was growing up way too fast.  I know that now and understand it now what they wanted for me.     To conclude, lets keep those filthy books and magazines away from the younger kids.  I don't want to see it get banned from the libraries or taken out of libraries; I just want to see parents stepping up to be parents and not letting their young children be exposed to that kind of thing.  It isn't the libraries faults if people's children are being exposed to this explicit material; it's the parent's fault for letting it happen",0

"Would you remove a book from a shelf just because it offends you? If you said yes, how is that any different than a white boy saying i can't learn with this black girl in class with me? Or if two people with different religions yould say he or she offends me because we dont believe in the same god.     Just because someone is offended by book or wrighting does not mean it should by removed form the shelf. In fact if they dont like it they dont have to read or even look at it. That is one freedom we have in america is to read anything we would like to. For someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom.          In conclusion it is not okay for anything to be takin off of a public shelf no matter who in offends. It is a right we have as american's to read or wright anything we would like to, And removing offencive meteral would be taking away our freedom",0
"CAPS1 people think that computers educate people for the future but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wraped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in LOCATION1. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and. CAPS1 children don't know the first thing about nature and. People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives. The best learn about it and help. Computers the time they are, the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearanged his schedual so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the enviornment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely tak a positive affect.",0

"What is a library?  A library is a place you go to that has books, movies, music, magazines, etc.  With these things a person can do research or use for entertainment.  Should there be censorship in libraries?     In my opinion there should be very CAPS2 censorship in a library.  If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left to use in the library.  Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good peace and quiet time and while there at the library they let their minds flow, imaginate, and dream.  They don't worry about being offended by a CAPS1 CAPS2 book.     However censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately.  For example, moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it.  What I'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard.  If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library, it would be an empty room.     If someone is offended by something in the library, depending on how severe they where offended take the appropiate measures.  For instance if something just offended someone unintentionaly leave it where it is, but if something offends someone intentionaly by their race, ethnicity or something like that, it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf.     Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar.  While at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended",0
"ORGANIZATION1, In ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit society these days. Ones opinion about what the effects that computers have or people are that they can benefit us in many ways for example they can communicate with people around the world for example many people MONTH1 have friends or family that live in another state or country computers can help us communicate with them. Commputers alow us to help us learn what we couldn't learn from books. Computers can help us with learning such as learning about or the population. One might think that is good but its slow with computers you can send emails and have the person on the other end reply instantly because of computers. Computers have benefited society in many ways. Computers in ones opinion about them is that they can benefit us in many ways we wouldn't think of being possible. Before computers and printers we had in use type writers and if you messed up you would have start again and it could take hours or work to get the paper perfect but with the worlds modern we would don't have to type whole paragraph over again if we make a mistake we can just hit the back space button on the keyboard so it won't take us hours to type one page or when it take half an how at most so computers have benefited us in more way than we know it. So in ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit us is that they allow us to do things we couldn't have done before the computer was invented. The computer was a great invention and it is benefited mankind as we speak and that it is that hard to set up. So in ones opinion about computers and what they do that can benefit the society that we live in and also benefit mankind as well.",0

If there was shade, a breeze, and NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A ghost town with no good water could have killed him.

Narciso talk about life at home and about his parents cooking. He is greatful for his parents cooking and how he learned from them. In paragraph three it states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that he considered people around him family and not just his blood relatives. He shows this by talking about how his surrogate grandparents lived in the basement and he didn't know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba. He is always grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. The whole memoir is about love, family which sets a positive mood for the reader.",0
I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country.

"give people the ability to learn from faraway places and even allow people to talk with others online. Theese effects are true but there are many other bad effects to that they dont like to say. Computers also effect people's visiion as you are really close to the screen, computers are really addicting for many people all around the world and having them do bearly no excercize moving many people to a big problem now n days which is obesity. Computer's also tend to take a lot of time away from people's lives. The way I see it to is that although computer's have some positive effects on people you can change those positive effects in a better way that can keep you fit to and seeing places with your eyes, like you can get practice with hand-eye coordination by simply getting a friend and pass tennis balls back and forth quick so at the same time your exercizing to. Also a computer can have you talk with your friends online but why not talk to them by phone if there far away n go outside and catch some fresh air n if they live close by why not talk to them in person instead. or if you want to learn about a certain far away place why not visit the place instead. There are many things you can do that a computer can do and better. but yet im not saying a computer is all bad at all. I agree that there are both good and bad effects to computers as well as most things in the world we live in. In my opinion to I honestly think there are more bad effects then good effects for computer's.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem they faced was that the dirigibles moored to the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame, so the stress of the dirigibles load would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation. Another problem they faced was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen so it would be very bad if one was destroyed by fire above densely populated downtown New York. Also there was already a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to even approach the area.",0
"To whom it MONTH1 concern, Computers are beneficial to society. They promote learning, coordination, and even general welfare. It is true that computers MONTH1 be detrimental to a person's health, affecting the amount of exercise and interaction a person gets, but the positive effects of computers more than make up for this. People learn much of what they know from the computer. Among an infinite number of things a person can learn from them are definitions new words, scientific theories, algebraic equations, history, law, any number of languages, and much more. Computers, when used for learning, can teach people things they MONTH1 learn in school, but on their own time, computers exercise the brain, and teach it to think beyond the bounddries of ""NUM1."" They also teach the brain how to better direct the body to face i'ts needs. Coordination can be very hand for some people, and this can be a problem. Without coordination, people wouldn't be able to catch a ball, avoid certain dangers, or even stand. To help improve this people need practice. They can get this practice from exercise catching ball, threading a needle, or using a computer. Using the mouse on a computer can help with hand-eye coordination in that it forces the brain to direct the mouse to a certain place on the screen, in order to accomplish what is needed to be done. At first, this process MONTH1 be excrutiatingly slow, but over time, as the brain gets practice at this coordination improves and the process speeds up CAPS1, the person will be able to use the computer faster and more efficiently. This will help them play games, learn, or even help people when they are in need. Helping people is very important in this day an age. That's why it is important for people to find out news quickly so that they can help. Computers allow this. For example, on the day of the deadly earthquake in LOCATION1, most of the world found out within the hour from computers. News sites broadcast its social networking sites such as CAPS2 talked about it, and people talked to each other online about it. This rapid spread of the news saved many lives in LOCATION1 as people immediately dropped what they were doing and rushed to help. Computers affect people in that they help to send out news and stories causing them to want to help people. Many websites also are adept at donating money while playing a game. For example, www.freenke.org is a site that donates NUM2 grains of rice for every question answered correctly, and they have donated over NUM3 CAPS3 grains of rice. Obviously, computers and sites like these have to have a positive effect on the world. Overall, one would think that computers have a mostly positive effect on the world. Despite limiting exercise, they encourage learning, and the exercise of the brain. Computers also help people with their coordination, which is very important. Finally, computers promote a world where people want to help each other, and a world where people keep up with current events, whether they like it or not. Thank you, editor, for considering my side on the positive effects computers have on the world.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The greatest obsticle was nature itself. With violent changing winds and climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down to the mooring mast. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles. The hydrogen is very flammable so people feared if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, all hell would let loose. These were a few examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building.",0
"'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' CAPS1 is such a strong statement by Katherine Paterson in regards to censorship in libraries. So often today do we hear of books, magazines, and numerous other resources in libraries being banned because of unpopular views. A classic novel, The CAPS2 of CAPS3 CAPS4, has been removed from the shelves of many public and school libraries because of crude language such as the word 'nigger'. Libraries should not take resources off their shelves due to offensiveness because it goes against the library's purpose and because many people have different views.     A library is a place with resources provided for information, interest, and enlightnement. When a book or magazine is taken away because of origin, background, or views that seem obscene or unpopular, then that library isn't serving its purpose. If I wanted to find a book on CAPS5 but the library banned it because another religion found its teachings offensive, then why not ban the other religion's books as well? CAPS1 goes back to what was said by Katherine Paterson earlier. What might be offensive to one person could be a lifestyle or interest to another.      Children, however, should be treated as a special case. No, a child should probably not, in my opinion, be reading about adult things such as sex. However, that child's parent or guardian is the only one who has the right to restrict resources they feel as inapropriate. In most public libraries, young children are not aloud to roam the library without an adult. CAPS1 is a very prominant rule because it sets boudaries for the adolescent so they are not to read about or listen to anything they shouldn't. Also, it is keen that libraries divide up the different resources into separate sections for children, young adults, and adults.      Banning books and such from libraries takes away a part of history and leaves a gap for the future. To find that what our parents were once reading is restricted should not be an issue. Materials should not be censored in libraries beacuse they are found offensive becuase CAPS1 is censorship and it takes away our rights.",0
"Libraries are community centers. Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information. If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never recieve those new experiences. Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library. If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well.       Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love. A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person; futhermore, take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it. One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts.      Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work. The movie industry, for example. The movie industry might second guess the directors or actorsactresses they are hiring. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries.      Music artist might also be affected. Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences. For example, ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper. He curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people.      Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings. It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers. If movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work",0

"I do not beleive that certain materials such as books, music,, movies, magazines and ect. should be remove, unless if it has nudity or a lot of cussing in the books. Because some books and movies are bad to show little kids. But i think we should have anything, that teaches you something in the labrary. plus people have to do reports and homework on some books, and if its about something with a little cussing and kinda graphic it should be ok. i think if the library have these kind of books, movies, music and magazines they should let you if you are a certain age or have a note from a teacher that you need that book, or some kind of rule that lets you choice any kind of book but with permission.     The library's would have more people going if they had more books and better ones. Because most of the things that people like is in the books or movies that the library wont have. So it just depends on the situation. There is a lot of offensive things out there, it doesnt mean you can keep it away from people. They will find out anyways sooner or later. I think its unnessary for the libraries to do that. I always hate when i try to get something when you find out you have to be NUM1 or older or have an adult with you. plus some people dont have computers or enternet excess, so they cant look up things easly. They have to drive down to the library to look something up and if you are lucky they might have the thing you are looking for at the library, but if they dont that sucks. So thats my opinion about have offensives things on the shelves.",0
"The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought in to the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accident before and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (CAPS1 NUM1).The winds at the top of the building would also blow the back end of the blimp around, and it isn't safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians, and the Blimp would be to low. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (¶ NUM2) ""-the back of the ship would swivel around and around-"" (¶ NUM2) ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" (¶ NUM2) the architects should've thought their plan through better.",0
"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast,"" there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One problem was that the dirigible's load and the wind pressure on the building's foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" CAPS1, this was a big obstacle for the landing process of the dirigibles.Another problem they had was that dirigibles use hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If it had caught fire, it would not have been good for a populated city. ""The Mooring Mast  of the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill it's purpose. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If the dirigible caught the building on fire, many people's lives would be in complete danger. In conclusion, the Mooring Mast did not work out for many reasons, but safety and the dirigible's load and wind pressure on the building's foundation were two big obstacles for allowing dirigibles to dock.",0

"The obstacles that the builder faced is making sure that the building was stable enough. The architects knew that they could not just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building.

While, the government is trying to find out a safe way for the mooring airships to mast. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame (NUM1). The obstacles that the builders went through was if a big dirigible was to go on top of the building it was add stress by weighing it down. Also, it would get to the point where it would reach the frame of the building. They had to use a steel frame in order for things to work out. But, at the top of the building the winds cause violent shifting out to air currents. Having a dirigible dangling over pedestrians is very unsafe or even good. The builder of the Empire State building faced many significant challenges to allow the dirigibles to dock there.",0
"I think it's okay for people all over the world to use computers: The reason why I CAPS1 this is because a lot of people us computers for a lot of things.

Lots of us kids go to myspace to talk to friends, family, people who we don't even know, people from all over the world and people that we havn't seen in years. Well then agian people also use computers to sell drugs which is very bad for our enviorment.

"Throughout time, fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive. It MONTH1 be the way they were brought up, or simply what they beleive. I do not beleive that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves. Everyone has one life, and in this one life we create our personal oppinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right. We are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles, and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals, beliefs, and customs of everyone in the world.     If I came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then I should be able to read that as long as I don't influence others by their own will. Let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive, I do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing. There is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part.      I think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child. That is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else, because they have undeniable duties as parents, and they be able to say what is right knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin, the architects were unable to just drop the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was due to the fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add stress to the building's frame. Though this was an obstacle, the architects spent over MONEY1 on modifications to the frame to remedy the problem.Another major problem with the idea of the mooring mast was general safety. First off, most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, as compared to helium, to stay aloft. This problem lay within the fact that hydrogen was highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1937, architects became concerned that the same accident could occur over downtown LOCATION1.In addition, the mast idea proved unsafe due to violent wind currents. To keep from blowing around, dirigibles needed lead weights, which couldn't be allowed to dangle over busy city streets. In conclusion, a final obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban a city. This made it legal for all airships to tie up or ******** this area. Those were the obstacles facing the architects.",0

PERSON1 was the happiest girl in the world that night of DATE1, NUM1 DATE2. The two went everywhere together and did everything together, everyone knew that they were perfect for each other. PERSON1 began to fall in love with ORGANIZATION1 and after four months of being together told him finally. ORGANIZATION1 was so elated that he went out and bought her a ring, and she graciously accepted it. PERSON1 and ORGANIZATION1 moved in together and started a family. A little laughter can go a long way, in anything you do, a job, a family, or even in the hopes of finding your perfect someone. PERSON1 and ORGANIZATION1 found that their love had come from that day many months ago in that park, laughing about even the smallest of things such as a corny joke, or an adventure of another can lead the way to a lifetime of true love. All it takes is a little bit of laughter.",0
"In my opinion, spending too much time online has negative effect on society. People aren't getting a full social experience when they talk on email, facebook and twitter. Being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas, such as family, friends and school. They aren't being able to enjoy the outdoors and being able to exercise. Though online activity can be helpful spending too much time can be harmful. Interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away. But spending too much time online can damage you social activity levels. In person interaction is better than online, because you see how the person you're talking to is reacting to everything you say. Having a good, positive social environment is benificial to you and your friend. Spending too much time on the computer can also damage you social relationship with your family. For family who live far away, and online is the only way to socialize, online interaction is a great thing to have. But for you close family, you could be missing out on their lives and how they are doing. Your relationship with you family could be in jeoporady because you insist on using your computer. When you use the computer, you're probably eating some food too. And spending time online is taking away your time from exercising those calories off. The obesity level in LOCATION1 is increasing, probable cause being over-usage of computers. being outside is another thing missing from our lives because of computers we aren't experiencing the beautiful nature life our ORGANIZATION1 has to offer, online activity is hurting our health, and making us not enjoy our outdoor life. In conclusion, being online too often is abusing our social, health, and taking up too much of our lives. Using the internet is good for adults so they can pay taxes, work at home, and do many other beneficial things for them and their families. But for other, less useful sites are being used to interact. Why not just call or meet up with person, instead of using the computers?",0
"Know you ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries.  Well ok then I will you my not like what I have to say but I really dont care CAPS1 if it was up to your dam goverment to decide what we could say or what we can read or even do. Theyd have us all in our house with our hands tied so we couldent learn more then how to eat, clean, and dress our selfs.      Now the way I see it is that we have every rite to read any book we please when we whant to read it. now if we dont want to read a book then we dont have to read it. but we as a people and they as a goverment do not have the rite to take your books out of the libraries. Now we as a people can press any thing we want CAPS1 no matter what they as in the goverment thinks it is the people who run the stat not the dam goverment.     My point is, is that the books are there to teach us about our lives, our histoy. Books teach us about what wrong and what is rite. Books are here to give sceary story by a camp fire they are here to give kids a bed time story.  If we take thos books off our shelves you think the kids of your generation are bad just wait CAPS1 the next one will be worse than this one i promise you that.      Now it is our rite to save our books, CAPS1 if we do not then us as CAPS3 will be lost. For without book our passed is lost, our fock tales are forgoten, our kids will not be able to sleep at night without there storys.      Now come guy as a all pull it together. If you see a book on the shevles and you think its offences then by CAPS4 put the dam thing down and walk away from it dont complane about it. No one told you that you had to read it. So don't ruine it for everyone just CAPS1 eather you dont belive in CAPS4 and you think that the bibles not rite then dont touch. its the same way around if you do bleave in CAPS4 and you think that all book that tell about a witch or vampires or that my even have a hore house in just leave it alone. its just a dam book let us read them. See you guy blame us kids that the vido games roten our minds but realy its the parent that dose CAPS1 see there is nothing more a teenanger like myself loves to do more than to do something there mom or dad says not. So gut just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do.",0

"A time when I was patient was NUM1 for CAPS1. My mom told my she was getting me a ORGANIZATION1 fo CAPS1 I was so happy then when CAPS1 come and I was opening my presents there was no ORGANIZATION1. So I asked her about it she said she would get it DATE1 when taxes came so I had to be patient and wait for NUM2 months and a couple of days. I was mad cause I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until DATE1 came. It seemed like the days got longer and longer. I was getting mader and mader that was the longest NUM2 months ever I didnt even know it could feel so long like that I though a year went by. Ater DATE2 went by it was finally DATE1 but I didnt get it to like the end of the month that just crushed my little heart so bodly to wait for some thing that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it was so fuh to play with all the games and apps and the conqurors is it was amazing.If something was to happen to it I would be destroyed. A ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you get it you have to take care of it. Thats why is keeping in a special place away from little kids. I dont even let them play with it at all and if I feel hide they might can play with my supervision thats the only time they can play. That thing cost to much money to get lost or broken. Specially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting some thing like it but its some kind educational one. My little brother is getting, a ds..Im happy they getting some thing they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games to it for my birthday I had one but my little brother or sister lost it I was so angry how they cant play it at all. That was defenitly some thing to wait and be patient about. Thats why??? can play it because Im saved of il getting lost or broke. If it does my mom wont get another one.",0
"Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves.  Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists triing to make a name for themselves.  If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding?  Libraries should not have the right to censor material.      One way to appeal to everyones demands would be to divide the library into two major sections childrens and adults and then you could contiue dividing sections.  Doing this would be cost-effective and adding a   age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get into there would be nice.  It would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book.     Censorship is defined as taking out a paticular item, thats either offensive to a certain group or is banned.  If someone took out PERSON2's PERSON3 statue and other peices of work, we wouldnt get where we would be today.  If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone.  Censorship holds back many artists true potential.  Limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world.     I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference. Many things interest different people. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all to well if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf than everyone has a right to remove a material off a shelve and so there would be no books left.  Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else.     Libraries should not censorship any material. Censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something.  As Katherine Paterson's quote goes 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf than everyone else has that right.   Censorship shouldnt be in libraries.",0
"The CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 extreme temperatures occur, the situation becomes very dangerous. In my case, the extreme weather was CAPS1. I lived in LOCATION2, LOCATION1 at this time and was eight years old. It happened in the middle of DATE1, CAPS3 an almost record high temperature occurred LOCATION2. The day had peaked at one hundred twenty five degrees CAPS4, and to make matters much worse, our entire neighborhoods power had gone out. Nobody had air conditioning and many people ended up getting severely sick or injured. We lived in a gated community, and everyone got along great. People from the neighborhood gathered together and put up tents for shade, and provided everyone with cold water. There are important things that you must remember CAPS3 a situation like this happens, you must have a good attitude, because it's no help to be complaining, also to not think about the CAPS1, and to help other people who need it. I don't think that our community would have lasted, if it weren't of everyone's great attitude and spirit, and of course, the laughter. It is so important to have a good attitude during a situation like this. What is the point of complaining and getting mad for no reason? I was told that it would not last forever, and to keep my chin up. I could tell that the many other kids, and even adults who were complaining were have a much harder time coping with this situation. It was very hard for me no not complain, being an eight year-old, but I eventually managed with the help of a lot of water. If you keep your spirits up, and interact with people, the say seems to go by much faster. I remember CAPS3 my whole family was under one of the tents, just sitting around telling funny stories, and telling jokes. I would have much rather had a day like that with my family than a normal, boring one. Out of the many important things you could possibly do, is to not think about the CAPS1. If you don't think about it, then you will have a much better time and not be complaining. It is important in many situations to keep your mind off the topic so you won't be stressed out. I saw many people there who just couldn't take it. They would only say how bad it was, and it was very easy to tell that they were all stressed out. If you try to make the situation a good one, and not keep thinking about it, then you will get through it, no matter how bad it is. During this CAPS2 of CAPS1, many people needed assistance. The community was a big help because they set up tents and provided people with water and snacks. However, it started to get bad, people were suffering from CAPS1 exhaustion, and many of them had to be put on CAPS5's. There were several ambulances there to help people out and get them back to normal. Some people did need to go to the hospital and get further attention. The community eventually got through the day with so serious injuries. The power came back on at around six o'clock. Being exhausted the people slowly walked or drove back to their houses. Our whole family walked back to the house and immediately turned on the air conditioning. Everyone was so relieved and happy that we were finally out of that situation. Even at night, the day was at a low of one hundred twelve degrees. We played games and told jokes the rest of the night and were able to get through it all. Our family had stayed strong through the CAPS1, while many others didn't last. It just goes to show that ,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""",0
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination and relief. For example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up.

"According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclists trip and how it affected her.",0
One when I was patient was when we were going of north. We had to pack but I was already done because I had packed the work before my family was packing still & I went to sit in the car because I was already ready I had nothing else to do when I went back inside the house they were almost done packing so I went to the bathroom when I got out they were finished packing. When we got going I had to wait for over NUM1 hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to mackinoc city from nbly. That day I learned a lot on how it is important to be patient.,0
"In todays world, children are exposed to a lot of inappropriate things than in recent times. They hear things from older siblings, see uncensored programs on television, hear words in music, and even learn things from books. An issue at hand is whether or not libraries should or should not dispose of inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines. Children can read whatever they like if their parents give permission, but in today's society some parents do not take the time to care, consumed in their work.     One way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books. There have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that I was not ready to learn about. Although I am lucky that my mother cares about what I read, some parents are not. This is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest. The librarians, or a national book association, could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age. This would take care of children reading about bawdy issues that they should not know about. Also, CAPS1 books should be more readily available. These types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life. In schools across the country, many CAPS1 authors are not in the public school libraries. By putting these types of books into the libraries, students would be more aware of them and would most likely have an interest in them, learning from them.      Another issue libraries have is music and movies. It is nice to be able to go to the library and check out a cd or even a movie. But, some of these have terrible language and scenes not appropriate for children. What can the general public do about this? Well, demand that all music and videos with content not generalized for children be removed from the libraries. This would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy. There are ratings on movies for a reason, so why not use them. Anything above NUM1 should be a definent no in libraries. If the movie has content that any child under thirteen should not see, then the movie should be out.     Magazines also offer a source of learning. Some are very educational, and give the students ideas to go and come up with a new invention or a way to help others. But, some have content that are not suited for children. Thus, like the books, the magazines should also have ratings. The magazine CAPS3, for example, has articles that are to bawdy for students to read. Magazines like this should be put in an adult section where students cannot look at them. Magazines also offer pictures that, in recent times, would have been illegal to put out. But, in today's standards, they are fine to put in magazines. These magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation.     America's standards on what is okay to read, look at, watch, and listen to have changed drastically. Children are learning things they should not know about, until an older age, at a very young age. Society need to put strict restrictions on what is right and what is not for children. I personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch, read, and listen to. My parents were very strict about this and, in the end, I feel this has benefitted my learning process. Also, I feel the libraries should rid of books that, in olden times, would have been a shame to read. Parents today are not as in sync with what their children do as they were in recent years. So, society needs to put a strict rule on what libraries carry and what they do not.",0
"I think that when kids or even adults get computers, then they would not use it for good causes. When people get computers they spend more time inside and on them. They need to get outside get some exercise. Even little things like, if your going to your friends house, then take a jog there instead of your bike. When people spend more time on their computers than talking to your freinds, then they will be low on socializing and, after awile won't know how to communicate with people. All they would have to do is set a time limit on their computer and only use it for work otherwise. Computers could also be used for good things. If you have a project for school and need to type it up on the computer or find pictures on the internet then the computer would be a good resource. If you have a job for working with computers or fixing computers, then you would spend a lot of time on your computer. It also lets you interact with people on the othe side of the world. You can also learn about interesting facts or places. Computers could also be used for bad reasons. When people use it they could just use it to play this cool new video game they got. This can lead them into getting obese. They can also use it for sexual harrasment for stalking people. People can also use it for horrible things like selling or buying drugs or illegal things. So as you can see computers aren't safe in a lot of ways. I hope you can read and understand all the important facts explaining my reasons and consider them. Thank you and have a good day.",0
"PERSON1, this is boring! I want to try my backflip! I whined. CAPS1, you're not ready yet, just wait. If you wait and practice more, it will be easier,"" said PERSON1, as she spotted one of the other gymnasts in their back-hard-spring. We had been working on our back-hard-springs for weeks and I was the best at them, in the class. We had to wait another two weeks until we started  on our back flips, but I really wanted to try it out. I rolled my eyes at ORGANIZATION1's answer, and continued to practice my back-hard-springs. I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called PERSON1 so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and PERSON1 was out of the room, so it was my chance. I took a deep breath and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. ""CAPS2!"" I yelled. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't; my ankle hurt so bad! PERSON1 ran into the gym as I fell, after attempting to stand up. ""CAPS3 happened?"" ""I tried my back flip.""  ""I told you not to! If you were patient, and waited till I showed you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened!""  ""CAPS4â¦"" ""I'll go get an ice pack."" CAPS5 since that day, I have had problems with my ankle. If I had been patient, I wouldn't have gotten hurt, and I would still be in gymnastics, CAPS6 then on, I've known that being patient is the right thing to do.""",0
I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.  But this is what I think is right,0
"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Safety was a huge issue. Foreign derigibles often used hydrogen gas to stay aloft, which is highly flammable. A fire posed a dangerous threat in such a densely populated area as New York City. Another great obstacle was the turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast, which would have prevented the dirigible from staying in one place. This would make it extremely difficult for passengers to safely board or exit the zeppelin. One way to solve this problem would be to weigh down the blimp with lead weights, but this was also a dangerous practice, because the weights could fall to the ground and crush those passing by. Although a mooring mast was in theory, a useful idea, it was neither safe nor practical.",0
"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, NUM1)."" CAPS1 example is This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June (Joe Kurmaskie, NUM2). The hotness and heat had also increased the characters confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, Id be fine (Joe Kurmaskie, NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he MONTH1 survive.",0
"My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to CAPS1 CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in CAPS1 CAPS2 so i just turned on my CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, CAPS6 and CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a ORGANIZATION1 CAPS8 establishment somewhere in CAPS1 CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in CAPS1 CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big CAPS13. We did not know the name of the CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the CAPS13 NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent ORGANIZATION1, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment.",0

"Patience, CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time.

I believe that patience CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a CAPS1 teacher for CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldnt be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on NUM1 and your going to go to LOCATION1. But traffic CAPS5 holding you down because of a NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as CAPS3 CAPS4 CAPS5 CAPS6 CAPS7 PERSON CAPS8 CAPS9. CAPS10 CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as CAPS11.

"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that the architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. There needed to be modifications made to make it safe for a dirigible to land there. The biggest obstacle was nature. Lüsted said it best in paragraph NUM1, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The final problem the builders faced was, even if they did manage to figure out a way to put the mooring mast up, there was still a law stating dirigibles illegal to land there. Lüsted said in paragraph NUM2, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Obviously, from the examples given, the builders of the Empire State building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",0

"Computers are something everyone uses but there is a time when you get off and start expericing life. Computers do teach hand-eye cordination, let you talk to friends and family, and give you the chance to learn about faraway places and people.

CAPS4  CAPS1 lives in ohio. He goes to CAPS2 middle school and day after school he was walking home when CAPS3 his friend asked him to wait in the parking lot for him so that he could call his mother and ask if  CAPS4 could stay at his house for the weekend. CAPS4 had to wait an entire half hour while CAPS3 talked and argued with his mother. But after CAPS3 finished talking thanked CAPS4 for being patient and they all spent the weekend at CAPS8 house.,0

"I believe the author chooses to end the story wit this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represent her home. But she realizes  by the sight of the geese, flying sooth that evenyone has to leave home at some point.

"In a study conducted by ORGANIZATION1, NUM1 out of NUM2 people are spending more that NUM3 hours a day on the computer. ""CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution,"" says PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. First, less people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. ""The more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke. Dr PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people want even turn off the computer the NUM4 hour a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative affect on person because they seeing beauty. Second, computers take up so much time that people are with their families. I used to think that talking with someone. Now, I've realized that talking in real life with people is better. I remember meeting the girl. She woulod always talk with email texting of instant messaging. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. All smart, intelligent people talks about families or just car and around, these sucessful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but NUM5 out NUM2 teens surveyed at ORGANIZATION2 admit getting that exercise. There has been a PERCENT1 increase in a obesity in children from DATE1 when computers weren't big. Now almost NUM42 of boys in NUM8 grade at ORGANIZATION2 agree to spending too much time on computers. In conclusion computers take away some important things line exercise. Come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative offers ? our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of families are seeing occupy their lives most a lot up and sight against computers today! It will be the best choice you ever make.",0

"When people think about computers the first thing they think of is games. Thats not all they are good for. For most people they are very usefull. Computers are great for ORGANIZATION1. At ORGANIZATION1 they help with homework and projects. When we are assigned a project we need to do research on a topic and the fastest and easier way is by computer. The students at ORGANIZATION2, especially NUM1 graded, are able to type up easys because it's faster and alot easier. If we are at home and we forgot our homework we could look it up online. This can be really helpful and convient to students and teachers. Sometimes it's not ORGANIZATION1 but its finding things. Technology and computers have came a long way. Now we can look up directions to places we dont or cant find. People can also finding names, numbers, or address useing websites like yellow pages can be a relieable resource for that. Say your going for vaction and your try to find somewhere to stay it could be tough but there are websites you can go on were if you want something fast or mabye a nice hotel for a low price you can find it. The computer can be very fan and intersting when you go places like the CAPS1 CAPS2 and you want to show picture of the great time you had so you can post them online. Say you havent talked to and old friend in a while, you can look for them on CAPS3 or another website and start talking agian you can also play games and connect with friends or play games with friends while online. Weather its ORGANIZATION1, finding things, or connecting with frends the computer has what ever you need. Maybe it will at one point get damged but they have people who can fix it. Plus if you think about it computers have very reliable resourses that are more updated then books.",0
"I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's facebook, myspace, aim, you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""oh tha's what a phone is for""? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers right""? This is where independnece comes in. Get off or it. it's your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go ourside, enjoy nature. AMybe do a little excercise.",0
"Green is not my favorite colorLaughter is an indulging part of life that a variety of people MONTH1 enjoy or MONTH1 not enjoy. Humor happens to be infectious. The sound of roaring laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When laughter is shared upon one another, it binds people together and increases happiness and intimacy. Having to pick out one of the million laughter memories I have had was nearly impossible for me to decide, because every moment I spend opening my mouth and bursting out my ""ha-ha-ha"" with joy and excitement. I try to indulge the person I spent it with and the exact memory that happened.  It was the DATE1, CAPS1 for many of us DATE1 is one of the most enthusiastic times of our twelve months in the year. I was going to be hosting a pool party with all of my friends, CAPS12 I needed to clean it out because it happened to be awfully disgusting from all the year long seasons that the weather decided to bring down. I didn't think it would be that much of a deal because that was the only way I would be able to host my party with my parents permission. CAPS1 if you know me well enough, I am the average typical teenage girl that probably texts more than NUM1 texts a day. So since I can't keep my white, somewhat sweaty hands off my phone you MONTH1 already have a feeling of what happens next. If you taught I dropped it. Your absolutely wrong. Not surprisingly after cleaning out my pool for about one hour I finally finished, CAPS2 I texted my boyfriend telling him that my pool was no longer green anymore. He replied with "".......?"" I questioned myself if I had sent the wrong message to the wrong person so I checked my history and it turns out that I had wrote to him, "" CAPS3 my poop is no longer green anymore."" I was literally mortified. I didn't know what emotion to feel or what to expect from him later that day. I decided to just pretend it didn't happen anymore. So later that day my pool party started. Everyone showed up and looked at me in a weird way then usual CAPS12 I was to ecstatic and pumped to my favorite song by my favorite singer NUM2. As everyone showed up they all had a present bag in there hand, I wondered to myself why they brought presents if it wasn't anybody's birthday it was just a casual pool party to welcome everyone's favorite season, DATE1. So I asked the question to my best friend and she told me, ""CAPS4 we know its nobody's birthday CAPS12 CAPS5 texted all of us telling us you had green poop, and you were not feeling well so we went to CAPS6 to buy you CAPS7-CAPS8, and CAPS9 CAPS10 ."" I was petrified and to be honest actually laughing insanely hard. So I stood up in front of all my guest and told them what had really happened and we all laughed historically. Without exception we kept the party going, and I eventually saw my boyfriend coming. I walked up to him and all we did was laugh with compassion and didn't mention one word about what had happened.   Once the party was over and it became dawn we decided to have a bonfire and get cozy with our loved one, and just all us friends bond with one another. You can guess what happened next, we began to talk about what had happened earlier and I can honestly say I don't think I have laughed that hard in my fifteen years alive. Rapidly our curfew had almost expired for the day, so all my friends left and they made a nickname for me, ""CAPS11."" CAPS12 the funniest part about this story that I will never forget is, that when all my friends left, my boyfriend decided to take me out and get a burger at our local, also known as the best hamburgers in our town. As we finished eating a mother came along with her baby boy. I had to take a few seconds out of my life to carry it, and make my dummy looking face in order to make it jiggle a bit. CAPS12 little did I know that the baby had just eaten. So you can imagine what happens next, green vomit gets all over me. I was honestly not mad, nor embarrassed. I just laughed so hard that I could feel my abs working out and tears from my eyes coming out. I believe in each and everyone of our lives we all have a special moment we desire to worship forever. It MONTH1 be sad, embarrassing or even a comical quality type of moment we indulge in our memory. So till this day I am still known as ""CAPS11"" to my friends, and there is no doubt that I will ever forget this memory.",0
"Although Al Smith had expected the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to be unique and practical, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, in order for the building to accommodate the stress that the dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to be modified. This cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen-a highly flammable gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would making docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying to low over urban areas; it would be illegal for a ship even to approach the building's area.",0
"Based on a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a specific mood is created. First, the author tells about a love of cooking in the kitchen with his family and the meaningful Cuban dishes prepared there. This creates an atmosphere of passion. Rodriguez describes, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (paragraph NUM1). This quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and traditions. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with this neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the authors loving emotions towards his unofficial family. The author writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph NUM2). Finally, the author shares his gratitude towards his parents and all that they have done for him. His passion for their strength, perseverance, and teachings create a passionate atmosphere.

"Moving CAPS1 The CAPS2 CAPS3 In CAPS4!     When you enter a library or a book store of course you will find CAPS3 that you like and dislike. You're opinion MONTH1 not be the same as someone else. Sometime you can feel a little bit uncomfortable with the situation and the way thing are going. People have diffrernt looks about different CAPS3 in this way of CAPS4. You are going to come across good CAPS3, bad thing, happy CAPS3, sad CAPS3, CAPS3 you agree about, and CAPS3 you disagree about.      I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else should not be removed if they are found offensive to anybody. The reason I state that is because if any of those items offened one person they might not be offensive to another. Different people have different intrest in many different CAPS3. So therefore it should not be any reason that the materials should be removed from the shelves. Especially if they are not hurting anything or anyone physically.     Speaking from personal experience there were many times i felt offened about certain CAPS3. I feel that abortions can come off a bit harmful to a CAPS4 that has not been born yet. Killing a child that has not experince the thing you have is not right. But some sometime the way i can feel can be alot different to other people. So who am I to tell another person what they can and can not do. That comes with voicing your own opinion.     You can not change the way another person is thinking or feeling. If you find a book or anything like that hard to deal with it is crazy. Think about the CAPS2 situation that you might come across and can be offensive to you. It will be alot of times you will disagree or have an opinion but can not change or do anything about it. CAPS3 will be much easier and less CAPS2 if we sometimes deal with the difficullt CAPS3 in CAPS4",0

"It cant be known as, ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well.

Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT.This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the  cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me. CAPS2, this quote show of some of the dangers the  cyclist encountered.

"I'm writting to talk to you about the use of computers. I think computers benifit our comunties a lot. I feel this way because it can warn us about a natural disaster. It teaches us about everything & everything. Last we get to talk to people online In these next paragraphs ill share my thoughts about this topic to you. My first reason is natural disasters. Computers always warn us about them. For example when hurricane katrina hit computers were able to see that on their. Many people was able to flee the city before that happened. States shows PERCENT1 of the natural disasters computer classified them. Computers saves people live eaach & every. Another example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in LOCATION1. Computers informed many people about them. Those were my reasons how computers warn us about natural disasters. My second reason why I say computers benifit us is because it teaches us about everything & anything we learn about faraway places, new word & things that is happening in our own country. For example I had to research a person my project & all I dis was type in his name & pages full of information popped. You will be amazal how much information the computer has. Comuter has everything you need on as person & so much more. this is my second reason why computers are helpful. My last reason we get to talk online. Now the has its pros & cons. Talking online is very fun. I mean you in many website, myspace, facebook, twitter. Its never ending. People can talk to old friends, family anybody really. But many people have to be careful cause their creeps out ther. Like say you can't meet up with you friend you can ORGANIZATION1 or ooVoo (webcame) them. The computer is you friend. So you might as well make good use with it. This is my last reason now the computer can benifit you. In conclusion I think the computer makes the world that much easier. My reason why you ask. It warns us about, natural disaster. It teaches us everything & anything. Last up can talk online.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted shares some of the obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the Empire State Building. Lüsted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction in ""The Mooring Mast"". Nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles. As Lüsted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became issue. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse ""an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field. The laws in affect of the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law makes docking a dirigible impossible in New York City.

"What CAPS1 You Do?     A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive matterial to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the ORGANIZATION1.     What is conciterd offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there CAPS1 be nothing left. You MONTH1 think that the ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the ORGANIZATION2 is false, they MONTH1 think that by having the ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.      There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people MONTH1 not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.     In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the libraries own resonsiblility to be a mother to all of it's cusomers. Let the libraries be!",0

I just CAPS1 a puff of smoke, and waited for hours I sat, shutting out the rest of the world to shield my own thoughts. Would it be picked on? I sat, ignoring the nurses pleading, trying to reassure me. Would it shut life out? I sat, waiting for my newborn child. My silence was broken, by a baby crying.

"Books on shelfs are there for a reason    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson wrote. The quote in short words for me means what should and should not be allowed for children and what they should learn as children. Libraries have non- fiction and fiction books as well as magazines, music and movies. I myself like to learn a little bit of everything but of course there is things that I dont like learning when I am too young. I like discovering things on my own. There is times where I do like discovering new things because I dont know when life ends. In other words I'm surrounded by reality and have to come out of the fantasy world. Magazines also just have a lot of trouble and sometimes, yes it's life but also its just dramatic things about people     A library is a good place to learn lots of things. You can learn about the history of presidents, countries, important people music,etc. Honestly, the only thing I go there for, is to read and to check out books, but from books I have learned a lot. There is some material that shouldnt be read and discovered when your too young.      Theres material that is too strong for some children and they should learn it as they grown not in a bunch. Libraries should have different stickers or labels on books for children and have a warning signs for their age. There is times where it is good to learn about life but you have to becareful because it MONTH1 be to strong. There is books that teach you a lot. I have learned a lot from old books to new books. I don't think that the books should be removed, yes they MONTH1 be strong, but is our owns choice to read it or not. There can be racist books, but they are there for a reason and it's not to make fun of people.     Magazines also are sometimes good because they teach good things and keep you updated about whats going on around the world. There is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people. I dont think its important and to be showing other people's personal lives or criticizing it. That is deffinetly not good for children to learn at that age. Magazines shouldn't be removed because everyone else has a decision at what to read and what to look at.      Music, at the library there is mostly music from like a centuries ago, but they were also great composers. No the music shouldn't be removed because everyone has a different taste in music. There's also new music, everyone has different taste and should choose what they want to listen to or who to listen to.      Movies, are a big part of life, so I think. Theres a lot from them that I learn from. From slavery to the future, there are movies where I have learned a lot. There is also some videos that are rated CAPS1, NUM1, CAPS2, etc. It is our choice to watch the movie without no one telling us if we should or not.      There is different reasons why there are certain books, music, magazines, movies that offend people, but it also has a significance. Books are not racist so other people can be made fun of but to learn what they went through. I'm glad that I as I grow I know what to learn and when I'm to young to read something. I think it should be allowed because it's for everyone. I dont think nothing should be removed from shelves even if the material is offensive",0
"People always believe that technology today such as computers are making more and more people lazy and not going out into the real world such as people who don't spend time with family, become very unfit, and also CAPS1 websites and people you talk to can put you in harms way and you can get hurt. First, who wouldn't want to spend time with family and find out things that happend to them, CAPS1 people because they are to busy being on the computer instead of going camping with the family, going to an amusement park and also some family gatherings. People who thinks that the computers is a helping thing to use but PERSON1 said ""CAPS1 people learn much easier from family of friends then from a computer. Second, CAPS1 people are becoming CAPS2 because of computers intead of going for a walk or nice day they sit in their room and sit on the computer and seeing virtual things instead of seeing things. CAPS1 prove who are sitting on the computer people you might should be joining a sports learns with everyday. Last, CAPS1 CAPS3 that go on the computer and adults are getting because of the of talking to people you have never seen or really know about. When you are on and someone and live where you live they can be lieing and you could take them seriously and meet up with them and that is how you can get killed or go missing. Also, the computer allows you to put pictures and videos online and a lot of teens and adults are posting up on the internet very inapropriate pictures of these bodies and people should't be seeing that. I hope that if you or a family is always on the computer you should say you need to spend time with your family, you can become very unfit, and you can be at risk of getting hurt by people you don't know.",0

"During the construction of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock, there were constant obstacles faced by the builders. Architects could not place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. NUM1 ft dirigibles would add stress the buildings framework, therefore causing the architects to modify the framework. This would cost them an extra MONEY1 for the modifications. The Architects don't know if these modifications will help. Safety is another concern. Foreign dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. For example ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects also had to worry about ORGANIZATION2 and the constant shifting of the winds due to violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" CAPS1 dirigibles land in open fields where they are weighed down so they won't drift away, except it is impossible to weigh down the dirigible in the air. They dangle high above pedestrians walking around on the streets, therefore making it not safe. There is also the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" There were two attempts to dock on the building. NUM2 was in December 1930, the ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles Attempted to dock except it couldn't get close enough to to high velocity winds. ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared."" Airplanes became the future.",0
"The CAPS1 and Benefits of CAPS2 is really an important thing in life. Laughter lightens mood and makes you feel more happy. If people laugh more often their days are more happier, lighter and much more shorter. Little children are the ones who laugh more often. Making adults laugh is not very easy because they are more serious. There are a lot of stories that laughter is the important element. Laughter can connect with many other nice elements, such as being glad or happy. I have once read a story about a little girl named CAPS3 who liked to make people glad. And through gladness, people were made to laugh more often. And through laughter, the sick people became healthier and stopped being sick. Laughter consists of many different factors. For example, being glad leads to laughing more, being happy, and of course smiling more. When you are felling down and some stranger for example smiles to you, you feel happier and maybe your mood is going to lighten. The morning dawned to be gray and rainy. The people of the household woke up irritable and grumpy. Everything was going up-side down. No one was smiling. The breakfast was a very monotonous one, because no one felt like talking. It seemed that the day is going to end like this.  CAPS4 was also very grumpy this day. She didn't want to go to school at all. She was mad at everyone and everything. She was mad at rain. Rain was her worst enemy because then she couldn't go out for a walk with her friends. She was mad at her maid because she has forgotten to fill her pitcher with warm water, as she always did. She was mad at her little sister for taking her blue hair ribbons. To tell the truth, she was mad at everyone, and she has not even thought that if she had been more happier today, then everything will seem okay. Well, so, she still had to go to school, wanted she or not.  At school, the little teacher was merry as usual. She wasn't a bit grumpy, even if it was a rainy and gloomy day. Some of the student had the same mood as the teacher, but there were very few of them. The school work seemed endless to CAPS4, especially her mathematics. But everything changed after the teacher has told everyone that it was story time. The story was about a little orphan girl who had to go live with her mean relatives. But she wasn't at all affected by their moods. She was very simple and always happy. Over a period of time, the people she was visiting (especially the sick and old) begin to be happy, just like her. And when she had to go away from that village, everyone was sad to see her go. With lightness of heart and being happy, the girl has left the most precious gift, being always happy which led to laughter more often. Even when she was gone, a passing stranger might always hear happiness and laughter. And it was even enjoyable to stay in that place a little while before continuing your journey. Because the passer-by's always felt themselves feeling much better in health, because of laughing. After the teacher has finished the story, CAPS4 thought, why wouldn't she try to cheer her family up? Even though it was raining, it didn't mean that everyone should be gloomy. So after the school was finished, CAPS4 ran home to cheer everyone up. In the TIME1, when everyone was finished with their day's tasks and relaxing, there was laughter heard through the windows. Seems like CAPS4 has found a way to lead laughter into her household too. The story she had heard earlier in the day has helped her today, and all through her long life. She has remembered this special rule of home happiness. And always in her home there was happiness and laughter even on really gloomy and dark days. We can see that this small factor, which doesn't seem to big CAPS1 to us has made CAPS4's life more happy. I hope that this little factor can help you too.",0
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety issues, nature itself, and the law.     Safety was a big issue when it came to dirigibles docking over a populated areas such as New York City. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" After an accident in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it were it New York City.     Nature causes lots of obstacles inlife, like wind which made it very hard to dock a big dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of ship would swivil around."" They would be dangling high above people which would not be safe.     There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the law was dropped.     Saftey, nature, and the law kept Al CAPS1 dream from coming true. These obstacles were the ones the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.",0

"The mooring mast seems like a great idea. A landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future. As it turns out, however, architect Al Smith bit off more than he could chew. First of all, the fate of the Hindenburg put worry over the owners heads. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that (Hindenburg) accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The second problem is that there is an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. As stated in paragraph NUM1, ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approch the area"", The final and most problematic part of the mooring mast was actually revealed to be nature itself. As it turns out, the wind on top of the building were too violent and unpredictable. Even if the dirigible was tethered, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". Overall, it seems like this was a great idea gone bad.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships one of the most obveouse reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident accured like a fire, the entire area would be in danger. The modifications made to the building itself were big enough, without needing any more additional work done. The most import reason would be manoverability. The strong winds made it difficult and almost impossable to control the blimp, never less dock it. The ORGANIZATION2 law even banned aircraft of any type flying so low.",0
"In the process of building the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles for the builders. Al Smith, who was the one who designed the building, wanted to make the building taller. He did this by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching 1,250 feet high. There was obstacles in the way of attaining this goal. Safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was used in the dirigibles, which was highly flammable. An accident had already occurred having to do with a dirigible, called Hindenburg, in New Jersey. As popular as New York is they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area. Another problem that occurred to stop this building from being used as a mooring mast was the powerful wind currents that constantly shifted. The dirigible would be dangling high over pedestrians swivelling around because of the wind, this made it very unsafe and not even practical. One last reason the Empire State Building would not be able to have a mooring mast in which dirigibles could land was because there was a law which stated airships were not allowed too low over urban areas. These were some of the obstacles the builders of the ORGANIZATION1.",0

"I think that the computer is not a bad thing becase of three resons one reson is that we can learn a bought a faraway place. Another reson is they teach hand-eye coordination. The last reson is we can talk to frteinds and meet new people. From the computer we can learn a bought a faraway place if we were doing a report on it or just our of curiosity. We can learn wat kind of plantation grow there for food for example tropical places grow bananas and cocanuts. We can learn wat they eat like in LOCATION1 they eat many beans a lot of there food have beans even there salads. We can find out there language as well maybe they talk spanish like in LOCATION2. You can also teach hand-eye coordination becase it involves using your fingers and eyes to see what you are typing. You use ur hands on evry thing while typing wether you are typing or you are using the mouse. But it is not just for learning things it is also for freinds becase of al these sites like myspace, facebook, aim, webchat. The posibilities are endless u can even play games. If you dont know someone on face, book, or myspace thats okay it is a great way to meet new people and new freinds. And another thing if u are having trouble findin freind you can just see if they are online. It is good for getting together somwhere or something. And for those pepole who think it is taking away family time you can always just say okay thats enough and talk to them. So that is it they are good because u can learn of places, hand-eye coordination, and talk to new and old freinds. so they are good",0

"Every fiber of my being was urging me to talk to her, but my gut churned with anxiety every time I gathered up the courage to do CAPS6. Then she glanced at me. Just for a second, but enough to gather information about me. Enough to tell that I wasn't just looking around the room vacantly, but I was focusing on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I sheepishly flickered my eyes away, quickly counseling myself, why did you keep looking at her? You knew that she was going to notice! But somehow I knew I wanted her to. I wanted her to look back at me. I didn't feeling her gaze upon me anymore, even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell into her sight. I didn't know what to do about this, I haven't been in this situation before. CAPS5 girl has ever beaten me to first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, I've noticed you noticing me, I don't see why you need to hide it. I have my eye on you. All I could do was focus on not looking like a moron. I willed myself to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know i saw her smile, and it was at me! There was PERSON1, smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then DATE1 came. The ice rink in LOCATION1 was about NUM1 minutes away, which seemed short because of the NUM2 friends that were howling and talking crap about each other in the back. We drove up and parked next to the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice.Our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn, probably never cleaned, ice skates. Absently we slide on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors. One-by-one each of us stepped cautiously on to the ice, making sure we didn't look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us. When we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink. Every once in a while we'd race each other for a lap around the rink, but besides that we just talked about CAPS1 of CAPS2: CAPS3 CAPS4 and the various other games that held our interest.  But as usual that conversation turned into a debate about ""over powered classes"". One side complaining that they can never win against that class, the other saying that it's very easy to ""destroy"" them with a simple trick. I proceeded to daze off out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothes line out in a DATE2's breeze. Then as she looping around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed, just as beautiful as before.  She wasn't having the hardest time skating, but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, but was able to regain her composure within a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap. ""CAPS5 the sniper is CAPS6 LOCATION2, you don't know what you're talking about!""my friends sneered at one another. I had CAPS5 interest in being pulled into this argument. As I sped up away from my friends, and weaved my way through the crowd, I eased my way towards PERSON2. As i approached her I was running one-liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her.  I noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she began to stumble, I had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her. Right when she was about to fall over I sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards. But she was too far gone. She tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice. As the commotion seized, she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughing. All she could do was laugh along.",0
"CAPS1 personal opinion on computer technology is that it is extreamly bad for you, and we need to take percaution, and worry about eye protection vertual harrasment, and that there are dangerouse people on the CAPS2. Eye protection is important. Although computers are hurting them by, the screen being too bright and hurting your eyes. Also if you look for too long it could make them tierd. I can tell you from personal experence that glasses are un-cool and some people get picked on for it and that could happen if your eyes get hurt so you can see as well as you did befor. It's glasses or even going blind. Vertual harrasment is another thing to be aware of. Over the CAPS2 you could be cyber bullyed by kids you MONTH1 or MONTH1 not know. For example, one day you could be on CAPS3 and be talking on a chat room and kids could make sexual, homophobic, or even just plain remakes. Witch brings me to the, sexual harrasment. Sexual harrasment if extreamly can make people feel usually bad selfs. Kids take pride in calling others bad names regarding there rase, there gender, or even the gender they like. So take extra percaution when seeing sexual harrasment. Sexual preditors are a parents biggest fear to kids. Sexual preditors are everyware, CAPS4, CAPS5, CAPS3, or even your neibors and wile kids are running around town looking and acting the way they do there extreamly un-safe. This is why you CAPS7 put any personal information on the CAPS2 not your adress, not your birthday, not your cell or house numbers, nothing not even your town.

"Computers have been one of technoligy's greatest advances, and yet one of society's downfall. Originally thought to spread ideas and faraway places, computers have been proven to do quick the contrary. Computers are dangerous devices, and are targeting young, wholesome kids.

These devices, the source of this mayhem, must immediately be removes from society because they take away the true benefits of life, have harmful effects on our health, and support some of the country's deadliest predators. Firstly, computers are linked with the crime of stealing the pleasures of childhood. Since DATE1, the amount of adolescent users has shot up PERCENT1. Amazing ly enough, PERCENT2 of parents polled admitted that their children spend at least NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. This takes away the pleasures or reading, exercising, spending time outside and hnging with friends and fmaily. These negative effects have an unhealthy toll on society, especially teenagers, the most frequent users. As a result diet and exercise are curtailed, raising the obesity number by PERCENT3, and lock of ourdoor or family activities have promoted anti-social CAPS1 this alarming rate out fufture generation MONTH1 indeed be balancing on a cracked foundation. In addition to limiting diet and exercise, computers are also the source of yet another act. As long as the computers are plugged, they emit invisible wares of electromagnetic radiation. These waves are linked to diseases and cancers. Use of computers have to cause brain-tumors and leukemia, asw ell as brain disorder and cancers. Leukemia, when caused at a young age, is difficult to cuse and stants the child's development. Children exposed to at least NUM2 hours a day to ORGANIZATION1 compared to the few who spend their time outdoors are NUM3 times as likely to develop such possibilities. The ultimate prevention to such risjs is to to the rest of such causes, computers and it completely. Lastly, computers are harmful because they also a deadly we open. As an adolescent unthinkingly says the web and chtrooms, they are at risk of atteck by thousands of children predators prowling the web. Computers contain extremely valuable and secret information, such as names, birthdates, genders and even social security numbers. With one click, acfepting a strongers inivte, the online predators hack into the child's computer and obation such valuable information. Or the predators MONTH1 be less postive and attack directly-asking questions to the child themselves. In fact, a familiar story tells the unfortunate fare of one local CAPS2 girl, who unknowingly chatted with an online stranger. This online predator smoothly invited her to the mall, where they moved. A couple devastating, weeks later, the girl's reamin in were found, burned, as the last deadly act the predator performed on the teen.

It is amazing to learn that technology's greates advanvcement, the computer, can unleash such harmful effects. Lack of engaging activities such as exercising and reading are stunded by the ever distracting computer its electromagnetic radiation attacks our health and lastly, it supports the acts of the thousands of cruel, sneaky online predators awaiting your child on the web.

CAPS1 also explains how gratefull CAPS1 is to have his parents who did so much for their children to have a better life. They did struggle at times, but the author is still happy for what went right in his childhood, and having all these wonderful people there. All of the people that came and left his house for all those years made him realize that ""family"" is just being around everyone you love and connect with which makes a house a home.",0
"On DATE1, I had a mission trip meeting in LOCATION2, LOCATION1 at NUM1 o'clock in the TIME1. CAPS11 friend PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So I had CAPS11 grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to LOCATION2. When we got to the church I went to CAPS11 meeting till NUM2 o'clock, then went to bible study. I was tired and ready to go home by then.    Come to realize CAPS11 grandpa is know where to be found, he apperently left to go home and CAPS11 mom, grandma and CAPS11 sister CAPS3 had just got there to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting we went to PERSON1 craft store. When we got there me and PERSON2 went over to CAPS1 CAPS2, while CAPS11 mom, grandma, and CAPS3 stayed in LOCATION3. I bought me and CAPS11 mom a pair of comfortable slippers. then we went back into PERSON1 to brag about the slippers to CAPS11 mom and grandma.   That was a bad idea, CAPS11 grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to CAPS1 CAPS2. She was taking forever. I told her that if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to CAPS6, get a sandwhich, and come back. So we did. When we got to CAPS6 PERSON2 was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home.   We ordered our sandwhichs and went back to CAPS1 CAPS2. She finally found herself a pair of slippers, after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think were going home when all of a sudden grandma shouts out ""were going to LOCATION5's, I want a bowl of chili"". Our reaction was ""CAPS10, CAPS11 gosh"". We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says ""I need to go into ORGANIZATION1"", CAPS10 boy was that a mistake. We were in ORGANIZATION1 forever in a day.   After we got back in the car from ORGANIZATION1 I sat in the backseat in the middle of CAPS3 and ORGANIZATION2. I told PERSON2 not to forget to show CAPS11 mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was ""CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home"". All I could do was laugh. I was being video taped by PERSON2 and CAPS11 mom kept looking back at me to see if I was ok. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard I was crying, I lost all CAPS11 breath, and CAPS11 face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from ORGANIZATION1 to LOCATION4 road. When I eventually fell asleep.",0

"CAPS2 the world having a network where people can connect, learn and work efficently. This wonderful network is here in our computers. Computers benefit society because they help CAPS3 connect with far-away places, develop hand-eye coordination and get work done faster. In the days before computers we were isolated in our immediate area. CAPS2 being stuck in our town unaware of the rest of the world, unable to enjoy the beauty of LOCATION3 or send help to the starving people in LOCATION2. PERCENT1 of money donated to ORGANIZATION1 an organization that assists in global disasters comes from online. Without the computer how would our willing people help the rest of the world, or even know about the rest of the world? Give our community the ability to reach out to the farthest parts of the globe, give them computers. Computers produce games and activities more intense than you can find anywhere else. Playing baseball simply doesn't require enough focus. The computer's intricate experience helps future engineers or even pilots develop a focus and hand-eye coordination that could save lives. PERSON1, who trains the CAPS3 air force weighs in on the effects of computers. ""They have made a great deal of positive impact."" he states. ""CAPS4 soldiers have excellent eyes for controls and amazing reflexes, making them natural pilots."" CAPS5't our community have the opportunity to excel as well? The computers we own train CAPS3 as we use them to have reflexes and hand-eye coordination equal to the best of the military. Computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster. Before computers CAPS7 and calculating took PERCENT2 more time but now they get our work done quickly and without error. NUM1 year old author PERSON2 states ""CAPS4 computer helps me type CAPS4 writing a lot faster and it is done right more importantly."" CAPS7 and typing is just more efficent when you are using a computer accountants, students and even the journalists for your own newspaper need the computer to work faster and more efficently. Don't stunt our community's workers, give them what they need computers! Computers are too important and beneficial to lose. Our community benefits from the computers that help CAPS3 connect with far away places, give CAPS3 hand-eye coordination and help CAPS3 work quickly and correctly. So explain in your next article that we need our computers. Computers are necessary in our community and we would be last without them!",0
"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author's mood was very loving and I could the grattitude and respect in his voice, especially when he talked about his parents. He said ""There is no way to express my grattitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how impotont family and friends are"". The author obviously is extremly thankful for the enviroment he had growing up as a child and CAPS1 sure he feels very lucky to have had such a great, loving, childhood. I can tell he is very proud of his parents because they gave up everything to come to LOCATION1 so their children could have better lives. The author reffered to them as selfless, and I would agree. The mood of the entire memoir is mostly shown in the last two sentences where the author says, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That shows the caring, thoughtful tone the author had as he remembered fondly about his past.",0
"Life is a serious matter that should be taken into consideration. Life is what you make it and I have gave my best efforts to achieve this goal; even when it seems senseless. It maybe be hard to not be an effect of the worlds chaos and daily epidemic but doesn't seem easier or less stressful to smile than to frown. To live life in the moment with no worries of what is gonna happen just to be care free, I would consider it exhilarating. To be nothing but the purest form of tranquility.   My memories as a child are faint, but I am glad to say that I have some. Happiness as a child is most pure in my position . I long for that purity I once had, as most do. It was my favorite pair of plastic barbie high heal shoes or my special princess backpack with every princess or CAPS1 CAPS2. It was my parents making funny faces that made me explode in laughter because I could not possible hold it in any longer. All I longed for was a pick-nick under my favorite long green haired willow tree, to feel as free as the birds, to sing their beautiful songs, and to dance around with a never ending smile. It's the fragile youth of a child I longed for. It's a fragile youth of a child. As life goes on my purity has faded and the distance from people, the community, and myself has extended till I felt alone in sol om. I had changed as person when life when life burned me one to many times. I felt god had betray me if not hated me. I then had became a stone cold wall that no one could penetrate. But as I gazed into the mirror I no longer seen a CAPS3 for life just hatred. This moment in time changed my life perspective. My strong hatred for the world was begin to handicap me in various if not most important aspect. If couldn't open up to myself - how could I open up to the world? To CAPS3, to learn, to be free, and to grow was my ultimate goal. Within myself I learned the most important lesson; laughter and wiliness to be optimistic, compassionate, and understanding. Someone once said ,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""I believe this is an honest opinion worth trying to prove. Laughter changed my life, my world, and it's a reoccurring symptom that take pride in everyday. In my most embarrassing moments, most angry of times, and even within my deepest sorrows I still manage to scrap up a smile. Helping people helped me realize and understand this is passion of mine. I want to help the world not hide from their pain but just to realize life can take a twisted turn and still end up being alright. Even within the deepest darkest caves, their is always a rock awaiting to crumb to bring light. To me their is always a light at the end of the tunnel. In my light -- a smile can carry. I want to be that light. I want to be that re-leaving feeling that everything will be all right. so I live me life through a gracious smile. In my perspective if you create a smile and you will receive three more. This is my motto,"" CAPS3 life for what it's new adventures bring, just smile, the world will continuously turn as life rolls on.""",0
"Books, music and movies are all important, specially to kids. If we decide to take one book off of the shelf, then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty. The same idea for movies, magazines, music, ect. Even though, some parents do not accept it for their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' role to supervise their children and choose for them and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch.      Libraries usually require CAPS1 cards. These CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adults' materials depending on the kind of card the person has. Since it is the parents' decision to decide the materials their children have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their chilren have taken something they don't like off of the shelf. Libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society.      If we try to remove every single book, movie, song, or magazine that contain an offensive thing, we would have to remove almost everything. People have different cultures and beliefs. They might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing.      In the current society, a lot of people are more attratced to movies or music that contain some unappropriate materials because these materials have recently taken over in the media. We can't stop publishing them but we can censor them. There are different kinds of channels that view these materials. Internet, ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be under parents' supervision. Thus, parents can not blame anyone other than themselves, if their children read or saw unacceptable materials.      Libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change. Parents need to have full supervision to their children. Libraries enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the persons age",0
"The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What MONTH1 be offensive to one person MONTH1 not be to another. Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said.      The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective.      However, some books MONTH1 not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library MONTH1 not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to.     Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. It hinders expression. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it",0
"My say would be no. becuse all that was history, say you hade like a kkk thing or anything like that. say you had a wighting aport but need the information for that. you would need information for that and that information would have notes,dates and other thing",0
"The mood the author creates inthe memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso CAPS1 from Home: The BluePrints Of Our Lives, is CAPS2 but happy and loving at the same time. Narciso creates a CAPS2 mood because he explains about his familys troubles and his friends and local neighbors. Narcisco explains what they went through, Which makes a person feel CAPS4. Narciso also creates a happy and loving mood because he would say, People came from all over ""Made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants"" would come to this one city, they would unite and help one another. They would also consider each other one big family, which consists of happy and loving. Those are the moods the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates in the memoir.",0
"A kid walks into the library up town. He looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch. He checks it out and goes home to watch the movie. Later on, his parents come home to see their son acting out of the ordinary. He starts to say rude comments, being violent, and using profanidity. Who is to blame? The friend who recommended the movie, or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out?     Today, many libraries have a variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. Some libraries even have computers for kids, teenagers, and adults to use for certain things such as business, personal mail on websites, or games for kids to play.     But are all the libraries meeting their requirements? Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and even websites threatning. Libraries have movies that are rated CAPS1, CAPS2, NUM1, CAPS3, or CAPS4. They MONTH1 also have music that has explicit lyrics on the CAPS5. Some libraries MONTH1 not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others.     In my opinion, I think that if a library has offensive material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves. If the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music, and CAPS4 movies, they should possibly be fired. From my own experience, I have not had trouble with libraries and materials they have to choose from. I have not visited a library that has had explicit music to choose, all of the bad websites are blocked on the computers, and all of the magazines are appropriate for all ages.     In conclusion, libraries should have respect not only for people, but for the materials they have. They need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents. Censorship is required for every library and I think that all the libraries around do meet their requirements.",0
"Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesnt have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he wouldve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out.

"In PERSON1's excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although dirigibles were a modern form of transportation they were highly dangerous. As it states in paragraph NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen in highly flammable."" This along with the ""violent air currents"" as stated in paragraph NUM2, were two of the risks that the builders had to take into consideration. The builders needed to converse the idea of a safe way in which dirigibles could dock there insuring that no one gets hurt. Another obstacle the builders had to take into consideration was the law passed in which was, ""against airships flying to low over urban areas,"" as explained in paragraph NUM3. The excerpt clearly explains the complications the builders had to endure and take into thought when constructing the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building underwent many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",0
"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the frame work so it could be strong enough to with stand the weight of the dirigibles. Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an inccident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedstrians wasn't safe. Builders had troubles attempting to allow blimps to dock there.",0
"Throughout the years, many events have taken place in our history. Throughout these times the events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed. These thoughts, opinions, and facts MONTH1 be offensive to a select few in our CAPS2. The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no. Censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public.      Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect CAPS2. If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books the library would become a place where reality is not present. Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind. People need to get a taste of reality in order to survive in the 'real CAPS2' and one of the greatest ways to abtain this knowledge is through books. Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become. To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' CAPS2.      Certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of. The CAPS1, LOCATION1's genocide, and CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4 are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one and few people. However, history is an important factor in everyones lives; we know history in order to not repeat it. Losing this information is way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society. Without public records of these happenings, it can cause confusion and misconcepted views of important topics. If we censor all the media from libraries across the nation, ordinary people, such as yourself, would be 'living in the dark.'     As people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. Your rights MONTH1 be someone else's wrongs. What MONTH1 be offensive to you, MONTH1 not be offensive to the person sitting next to you. Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left. Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the CAPS2 goes around. We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions, censorship destroys our ability to do so.      Everyone is different. The CAPS2 is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts. By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our CAPS2 becomes an illusion. We need to have these facts available to the general public. By ridding ourselves of 'offensive' media we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful CAPS2. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it is harmul to our growth as a society and is overall the wrong thing to do",0
"The effect that computers have on people is not a positive one. I think people spend way too much time on computers, some information on computers is inaccurate, there are still telephones and cellphones that people can use fir communication. A majority of peoples' time is spent on the computer. Whether its playing games, checking CAPS2-mail, or even working, peoples' valuable time is getting used up. This time could be used by doing more important things such as being with friends and family, being outside with nature or exercising. Being on the computer insteads of exercising has had a huge effect on people. Some people are overweight because they eat and then do not exercise after. My sister works on the all day and she says NUM1 or NUM2 ladies at her work are un healthy because all they do is go on the the computer and eat granola bars, wich are usually healthy. If others spent at least a half an hour being outside to CAPS3 some fresh air instead of using a computer most of them would feel a lot better. My doctor always used to tell me and my brother, ""CAPS3 out and play an hour a day!"" This is true, and I strongly encourage people to go outside and do an activity as opposed to playing on the computer. The computer is used a lot for researching. Some of the information on the computer is very helpful, but you can never really know what information is inaccurate. At least when you research using a book or encyclopedia, you can trust those sources. What if you had to do a report and you could only use the internet, how would you be able to tell if the information is trustworthy? Sure, computers also teach hand-eye coordination by playing video games, but when in real life, will you need to know how to shoot a dragon or dodge candy that's falling from the sky? This is just an example of unneeded information and skills that keeps people wanting to go back on the computer. Another thing you can do on the computer is communicte with others. When computers weren't invented or even that advanced, people were more than happy to give one another a call. Now with computers, people CAPS2-mail, instant message, or even skype; a webcam website.

"The builders of the Empire State Building a great idea. They wanted to be able to tethered dirigibles, or blimps, to the top of the building. However, there were many problems with this idea. First of all, blimps themselves were not very sturdy. Strong winds could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings. Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. The smallest the sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze. The docking system its self was also a problem. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side. One concern was that a way could fall off and fall into the densely populated city below. This could've proved very disastrous!",0

"Censorship in libraries is a very contraversial.  Many people believe that it is the right thing to do while many others strongly disagree with it.  Censorship should not occur in libraries for several reasons.  All people have freedom of speech in the LOCATION1 and when books are taken off the shelf because they are thought to be offensive you are taking away that right.  Authors have the right to express themselves and the right to have their works equally acknowledged by the public.  Censorship is acceptable in some circumstances but what is censored should not be decided by the government.      First of all, freedom of speech is very important to the people of the LOCATION1.  If this freedom were to be taken away, it would definitely not go unnoticed.  When books, music, movies, and magazines are censored, the freedom of speech that the author had is being diminished.  For example, what if an athiest wrote a book saying that CAPS1 wasn't real?  Many CAPS2 would want to take this book off the shelves of all libraries.  Just because one group of people do not like the topic, message, or theme of a book does not mean that it should be taken out of a library.  A library is a place where all books have a chance to be read not a place where people get to pick and choose what they want there because of their beliefs.     Secondly, authors have the right to express their thoughts and to have their works equally acknowleged by the public.  Of course there will be books that are more popular than others, but at the same time there will also be books that are neglected not because the quality of the writing but because of the topic the author chose to right about.  There is no reason to have a whole community ignore an authors work just because a  large group of people do not agree with what it says.  In that small group of people that were not trying to get rid of that book you will find a number of people that would read the book.  Just because a majority does not like the topic of the work does not mean that the minority should have the book taken away from them.  The author has the right to what they wrote and should have the opportunity to have their work acknowledged.     Last of all, censorship can also be a good thing in some circumstances.  It just depends in what ways censoring is used. For example, many parents do not want their children reading, listening or watching certain things.  The parents of the child should be able to decide what a kid can read, listen, or watch, not a large group of people.  Many parents have different standards and what some parents find acceptable for their children MONTH1 appall others.  So, there could never be a set standard for what is acceptable and not acceptable without creating a large amount of contraversy.  Once that child becomes and adult they have all the rights to decide what they want to get from a library.  There should be certain limits though.  For example, a person must be the age of seventeen or older to rent a 'CAPS3' rated movie.  This is the same age a person must be to get into a 'CAPS3' rated movie without parental supervision.  Some of the age limits throughout society should be put in libraries, but other than that, the decisions should be left up to the person.     Censorship in libraries will always be changing.  Sometimes it will be in effect while at other times it will not.  People of the LOCATION1 have the freedom of speech and taking away books from libraries is partially taking away that right.  The author should have the right to have their book equally acknowledged by the public and kept on the shelves.  Censorship should be decided by the person themselves and should not have it decided for them.  Parents should have the say over what their children read and should not have that decision made by others",0
"If you were offinded by a book in the library would you want it took off the shelf? I wouldn't there is no point in removing it there are a lot of books that offend people, that one book isn't just towards you the same goes for movies and music.      Books should be able to be written about any and everything that interests people. Some people MONTH1 not find the same thing offending like you do everyone dont think alike. If books were made towards emotions or about how people would look at them then there wouldn't be that many books in the world today. This is a free country and we have the write to speak and write about whatever we want to get out.          Movies are anoter way of getting you emotions or expressing yourself. People find most movies offending but neither are movies made up of how people feel about it. We are able the express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies. No one or no race is the center of attetion in movies people MONTH1 feel as if they are but thats a personal thing people MONTH1 go through.     Music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people. Music MONTH1 be found most offending now days but, music is also away of getting emotions and freedom of speech out. I've never felt offended because of a song i've heard or anything people are going to say what they feel and want.     Freedom of speech goes a long way in the world people either gotta het used to it or stay offended. Books,music,movies, or magazines wont be pulled because of emotions. I look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things",0
I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.  so CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time.,0
"The features of the setting in Do Not CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" (Kurmaskie NUM1). The flat road that was easy to bike on had changed to many hills that made the cyclist's job alot harder. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope.",0
"In my life time I have been to many libraries. I also seen many diffrent catagories of books suck as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and etc. As we all know there are many topics out thier that is not suitable for minors or suitable for many other ages.     Movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes. For example in cartoons their are sexual content such as kissing .Some parents don't want their child expose to the kind of activity yet. Movies somtimes put false beliefs in peoples mind about the way things are, going to be,or the why you sould see it.Their are also some good movies place in libraries such ass docomentries, history , biography, and etc. Thats gives you good insite on how things was and hoe things are now.     Another topic is magazines. Its strange things going on in the world that CAPS1 sould be aware of the why we put them in magazines but children have easy access to them in libraries. Picture that magzines have are images that sould be places in some magazines. As there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine. Magazines are in some ways just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information.     Music is aslo a big topic thats placed in libraries. Some of the lauguage thats is place on  cd tracks are good BUT  theirs alot of bad material that on them also. So many people out the known as CAPS2 say some very harsh and profaine words that many and children sould just not want to hear. Like I said before as their is bad thier is much good. We have gospel , jazz, CAPS3&CAPS4, and etc that many people enjoy listing to.     In conclusion thier are many things good that belongs in libraries but also many bad. Libraries in my opinion sould take more caution on what people have access to. Very easy a young child (that can read) can pick up a adult book go sit in a corner read and be expose to most things parents are expose to. So in my opinion yes certin things should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive.",0
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the had to be modified and strengthened.

"Al Smith had a great idea. When he thought he was going to have a dirigible station dock on top of the world's tallest building. He had great creativity and wanted to use his building to full potential. Although there were many problems to this idea. One was the urban area below, many people lived in downtown New York City and it would be against the law to have zeppelins flying above the populated area. Another important problem was the intense winds that were harsh and made it very hard to dock on the building. There were many obstacles in the way of fulfilling Al Smith's dream for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on the top of the building.",0

To see that his parent made something out of notthing. The author parent show him with their life, and his teaching have been the basis of his life.

"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memior. First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents. Narciso explains that ""they had to start their lives over entirely."" (CAPS1 NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. He understands that they only left for his benefit, and he appreciates that. Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they kept their Cuban traditions. In Narciso's three room apartment, ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (CAPS1 NUM2). Lastly, Narciso expresses his appreciation, and strengthens the mood by defining what a home is. He claims that he ""will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home"" (CAPS1 NUM3). For these, Narciso is grateful for, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood.",0
"It was once said ""were there is a will there is a way"". How ever they didn't include the part about the obstacles you will have to go through. For instance how the was a will & way for the docking of dirigibles on the Empire state building, the architects just didn't work out all the possible problems of their idea. Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen. Also that the wind currents have a stronger force that high up in the air than to regular life level. Also the un-ideal place they were trying to use. They should've taken heed to the businessman's slogan ""CAPS1, CAPS1, CAPS1.""",0
"The idea of the dirigibles docking on the mooring mast was very smart and could've been great. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems when trying to achieve that goal. One problem was the wind forces were two strong to allow a dirigible to dock at the mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (¶ NUM1). Another reason is the safety of the people. Not all dirigibles were made the same. In other countries, dirigibles had different kinds of gases in them ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¶ NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to take in to consideration how safe people would be flying in a dirigible. Lastly, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to a populated area. ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (¶ NUM3). The docking at the Empire State Building was a great idea but there were too many challenges that faced the builders.",0
"In the memoir, the author doesn't just describe the journey to LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in LOCATION1 and the relationships he made. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place.The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place.If we do as they do, we can all live in unity.",0

wow thats racist. as i said when i saw the movi white men cant jump. yes that movie could have afended me a lot but it didnt personaly i thought it was funny i enjoyed it cuase its true statistics say black people can jump higher then white people. its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that.      everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them. but its your choice to take that to heart or just laugh about it. life is so much easyer when u dont cry over every little thing that someone said to you. see now i have a since of humor. when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself. i didnt care that it singled out white people so what its funny.     to kill a mochinburd was also a book that a lot of people called offensive and i can see why. it had the CAPS1 word in there a lot. but back then it was a different time the people in the book werent saying it to you so why would you be offended by it. he wasnt offending you.      if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life. somethings you just have to let go and roll off your body.     in conclusion yes we have had a lot of offending stuff said to us but you cant let it get you down so much you have to move on. and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run.,0

"""Laughter"" CAPS1 people MONTH1 actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feeling we can have, although it can hurt if its too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves, and forget about the bad in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a bore. But you never want to push laughter, because even laughter has a limit.  There is different ways to bring laughter in someones life, and there is different ways of being funny. There is good ways of being funny and bad ways. A bad way is being the class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can get you on your teachers bad side. A good way would to tell a joke or maybe sometimes embarrassing yourself can work. It seem to be the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think it was. I know that I can be funny at times, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it is never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making another feel bad can make you look bad, and others MONTH1 not think of you as funny. You never want to put another down, people have feelings, and hurting someone only makes you look like the bad guy.   CAPS1 people think that happiness is in fairy tales, also love, but when you really want happiness than turn to your friends and make them laugh. Getting another to laugh feels great, and it helps build up confidence and character. Having confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love, and others MONTH1 think about you in a better way. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just appears for no reason at all.    Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being a bore can make you seem like your not an interesting person or not really all that fun. When people fall in love they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, CAPS2 you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part in life. There is many adventures that life will take you through.  I love to laugh, it makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good on the inside and out. I also love to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend CAPS3. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going right, I knew that she wasn't happy and I didn't want her to feel like that. So as a friend I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Ever since then we've been best friends and she has never felt like that again. Laughter really is a great thing to have, it brings happiness to us all. And getting others to laugh makes you more of an interesting person, being an interesting person makes life easier and more stress free.  Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, along with sadness. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think that laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something that is just as great, is like finding a meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So go out and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good.",0

"CAPS3 CAPS4 all the talk about computers these days I would have to agree with the people who think its taking up alot more of our time. I hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining then being with your friends and family. Why do you think the obesity is so high these days? Well theres one of the reasons and I CAPS5 when my parents were kids that they had no computers and they went outside to enjoy nature. Computers have there ups and downs but I do not think they benifit out society, first reason being, computers are taking away time to be with our friends and family. I rember when facebook and CAPS6 werent created those were the days when people actually did fun things with there friends and family. there was a recent study that snowed since DATE1 to PERCENT1 of all americans use computers more than NUM1 CAPS2 a day for all sorts of diffrent reasons. I think mainiy computers were invented to make reason easier but now adays all we use them for is social networking. My second biggest point as to why computers do not benifit our is because over the past NUM2 years the obesity rate has gone up by PERCENT3 and due to what cause? eating un healthy food and sitting in front of your computers all day not exersiing. I am almost PERCENT2 sure that if people stoped using computers that our world would be a healthier place. dont you feel bad for those people who are stuck being ovwrsized for there whole life because of these habits? I CAPS5 most people would feel bad. My last reason is that we have this ahmazing planet that no one seems to enjoy anymore becaus they use up all there time on computers if only people got out every once and a while they would relize they have been wasting where time. there been a recent study that says PERCENT4 of people are inside doing nothing all day! thats more than half!! I hope this will change somtim soon because computers hace only created a nusence to people and now it seems like no one has any type of a life.. computers hace spread to all sorts ofs societys but please let it not take over this friendly town of CAPS1.",0
"Readers of ""LOCATION2 CAPS1"" should be well informed of the benifets of computers to society. Not only do they teach hand-eye coordination, but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means to easy, online communication. In this day and age, good coordination is esencial to prospering in society. Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand-eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace. Dr. DR1, of ORGANIZATION1 medical center, says that a recent study shows NUM1 out of every NUM2 computers users have better hand-eye coordination than people who do not operate on a computer regularly. In a local primary school, students have begun to ""CAPS2 to learn"", a program that promotes quick typing. School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in DATE1. In this way, the computer provides a secure route to better hand-eye coordination. Even more importantly, the hand-eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand-eye coordination as an adult such as the position of a secretary or grafic designer. While hand-eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more benificial towards all users. Website such as google and yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country. This can be handy when working on school projects as well; instead of having to lug tens of books home to finish an essay on LOCATION1, you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house. When summertime comes around, and the last school bell rings, you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments. All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer. If ""LOCATION2 CAPS1"" readers were aware of this, lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved. The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication. State officials, governers, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email. This is a much easier way to hear goverment statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the CAPS4. Social networking sites are also immensly popular, and on pages like facebook and twitter you can reconnect with people who you don't have the chance to see everyday, or don't lie relative vincinity. If your cousin is going to school abroad, and did not have access to an international phone, you could communicate with them through email on the computer, and it would be as if they never left. It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places, good hand-eye coordination, and the connection ten distant friends and family - a concern to society. They help town in countless ways and ""CAPS5 CAPS1"" readers should be aware of this.",0

"We all have that favorite book, mine is ' OF CAPS1 and CAPS2.' CAPS3 is a book I would recomend to anybody, but there are libraries that have some books that are so bad I would be scared if my mom even picked it up and looked at the cover. My name is PERSON1, and during CAPS3 essay I am going to show you what I am talking about.      I love to read during the day. I like to go out and just pick a book right off the shelf and start then and there reading, but when I see a book or a magazine that holds sexual acts in them I become very anger. I have seen many of my friends get lost in these books and magazines right in front of a adult like there mothers. They can go to a public library where they're children (as young as the age of five) and read and look at these terriable things. I don'CAPS4 know why these books are even needed in a library. Now people can get on the CAPS4.V's and but or rent them.     I have a best friend who lost is father to these sexual acts and pictures. My friends mother had enough and had to kick him out. Now my friend is becoming the same person. He can go out and buy these magazines from friends that steals or rents them from our local library. He doesn'CAPS4 even reconizes that his father did the same thing. He still never wants to see is father, but what he is doing is the same thing that his father also did. I have had varies talks with CAPS3 friend, but he said it isn'CAPS4 hurting anybody, but what he doesn'CAPS4 see is that he is hurting me.     Back in the late NUM1's early NUM2's parents saw some of the books that their children were reading. That tried to put a stop to it, but the plan never worked. Since then CAPS3 problem has grown to a point that we will never be able to control. The libraries do CAPS3 all for money they make. More people go to a library now not to study or to read in peace, but to get a sex high. CAPS3 is where about  half of the libraries money is being made. The goverment tries to stay out of CAPS3, because the money they get through taxes is coming of these people. When will it stop? No one really knows, but we will try to stop it all we can.     The reason for CAPS3 essay was to show why the process needs to be stop. If you go to your local library and really look at what they sell or rent out, you will then know what I am saying. I will try to stop it, but probably will not suceed. That will not stop me with helping my friends in the future. Just be glad that you know about it now",0

"Raded CAPS1 for CAPS2, violance and some nudety. This kind of movie shouldnt be on any kind of shelf. Its to inapprope for kids, see or even read what the movie case says.     There shouldnt be any kind of movie or magazine with nude pictures. Its bad for the kids to see or here because one day a little boygirl is going to do something that they see in a movie or a magazine and get in trouble. Its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me. The only person i want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years. But i dont want to watch a movie and see a lady nude.       The nest thing is violance. Man i just wish guns wernt invented or bombs. Because I have lost alot of friends to guns. I lost about six cousins in the war from where a bomb hit there area. More and more people and going out and buying guns and bombs because, of movies and what people say in books and in magazines. People are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market. People get these ideas because of movies.      Last but not least CAPS2 it the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools. They leard it from movies mainly because the actor say the words. Now the kids know how to say them.

Since the blimp was only held by one cable cord it was appling stress to the build because the blimp was pretty heavy. Another obstacle was nature. Since the Empire State Building was so high up the wind was excrushiating. The last obstacle they had to over come was the gas they used inside the blimps.

"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were harsh. The builders, in theory, thought everything would work perfectly. They had to face that they did not do enough to see if there would be any problems with having the dirigibles dock there. As I read I noticed the building never fulfilled it's purpose. This was because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen, not helium, hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse a fire could have been if it were to happen above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. So in reality this idea was not safe and the builders had to go through building it, having it all done. Then realizing the idea was not pursuable.",0
One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the change in structure and extra cost and time in the completion of the building the building originally was going to have a flat roof but in order to dock blimps they had to construct a rocket-shaped mooring mast.Another problem the builders faced was the building and their idea of docking dirigibles being approved by experts. The ORGANIZATION1 had to take tours of the equipment and mooring operations.

"Computers, More and more people are using them. They are used to talk, for lesieure and many other things. But are computers a good thing? Computers can be a very good thing to have around. Besides practically unlimited information, you can stay in touch with your family using ORGANIZATION1. You can use ORGANIZATION2 word to make documents and powerpoint presentations that organize your ideas. Also you can use ORGANIZATION2 excel to manage your finances! Windows movie maker allow you to contruct your own movies ifl you own a camera. Besides the obvious most helpful features, you can play computer games, watch mores and listen to music on a computer. Like anything, computers have downsides too. Some are small and some can be very big. computers are expensive. You can't see who's really talking to you on a computer. Also, many people have important information on a computer. Peoples computers have been infected and information has been stolen leaving people helpless. Bugs can also seriously damage your computer rendering it imposible to use. Many people can be smeared on the internet as well. Hate sites that encourage terrorism, racial violence and drug use are all over the web. You have to be careful where you go when using the internet. Also, sometimes computers can take over peoples lives. People spend too much time on facebook and not enough time reading or keepng in touch with family. Computers can be great things. Between their great features allowing you to be informed all the time and programs that or be great for managing buisness, it's no wonder almost every CAPS1 household has one. Many people don't like computers. They say that the cons outweigh the pros. I disagree. Yes, the cons can be annoying & sometimes serious. But if your smart enough to stay away from CAPS2-CAPS3, install anti-virus software, and never give away your information to an unamed surce, the pros outweigh the cons. So overall, if your smart enough, a computer can be a fun, convienent edition to your life allowing you to do more than you ever imagined.",0
"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed her home. It was hard for her to say her countrys home without crying. ""Its not like the wind we had at-at-."" She also spent MONEY1 on a plant because it remind her of back at home.

So CAPS2 was very great full and honorable to his parents because of what they did.,0
"I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated. For example if you were in on ????? would have lot of people wait in line to the ??? , if you're patient you would wait but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out. People might you now when you are patient??? Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. Though wait things ??? , which is not nice. Im conclusion I believe that being patient is very important in life.",0
"I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer. I thought to myself ""she is always on that computer, doesn't she work to do?"". I said to my mom ""I think we should have an hour two of the computer each night, or not have one at all."" I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. Also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends. The internetcomputers are very dangerous now a days. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is then or not. I could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you. Steal from you and worse. Now I watch the news and see many kidnapping because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. Like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot trouble. Maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important to most families now a days. I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated to their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends. She is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her. Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends. Even her grades started going up because she spending more time studying with her mom and dad, then being on.... for example CAPS1 or myspace and not getting any work done for school. In other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. People have spent more time having their eyes glue to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go a gym. The rate of obecity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend to much time watching tv and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But does she, ""no""... She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. She keeps asking me how did I get and what age, and I keep telling her, I exercise and play sports so I can't tell you when. I keep saying that to her but she never listens. To this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. I strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all. For kids saftey from bad people out there in the world, spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. I hope people understand what I say and take action to persue them in they own life and convice others too.",0
"I think what ever is offensive should be taken off of the shelf because it is inoproperate. Books do not need to be like that because they are supposed to be fun for you and help you learn, yes you can have a little violence in an actionadventure book to get the mood of the character, setting of the story, and to understand it perhaps.     Offensive books can be okay at times, so if you have a comedy magazine, or book that is making fun of something or someone, it can be taken in a offensive way, or just a joke, and a none offensive way.     To most people they are going to want to take those kinds of books off of the shelf. Offensive books to them, such as parents or maybe even friends, they can teach a child wrong, and that child MONTH1 not learn the right way. Kids when they are little, their brains are like sponges, so they learn, and remember stuff well at that age. A child getting a hold of a book or being tought something from a book like that will most likley remember it.     I think those kinds of books should be taken off of the shelf because, kids dont need to be reading that kind of stuff when its allready on television, and talked about. They need the edicational books that can teach them, and prepare them for their uppcoming higher grade levels, so then they would have a fresh start on new words or grammer.",0
"To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive i believe that they should still remain on the shelves. This book or music MONTH1 be offensive but everyone is intitled to their own opinon. People have all the freedom to read, listen or watch anything that is approperite to them. I believe it should all be up to the individual to chose what they should do with what MONTH1 offend others.      Also from my own exprience i have read a book about CAPS1 CAPS2 in the stadges of our history where they were salves and were hung for their punishment. It MONTH1 offend some that their local library having a book on such a terrible topic but it is found that it is part of history and others MONTH1 find it interesting to go back a learn more information. It does not have to mean that they are rascist or trying to offend you they would just like to learn more about our history. Each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy. If you chose to pick a book, watch a movie, or listen to music that MONTH1 offend someone then it shouldn't be removed, if you would like to read, watch or listen to anything that MONTH1 offend someone then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it.        Therefore, i conclude that if any books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive they should remain on the shelves. Everyone MONTH1 have their own opinon or have their own ideals that offend them but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries. It is for their own benifit, not for yours. It is up to you to decide wheather or not to come about the situation. Libraries should not be held responsable and have to removed anything open to the people that MONTH1 just be part of our background",0
"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that the most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, for example downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.",0

"Local Newspaper I think that it would be better if people get outside to get so exercise and enjoy nature to interacte with there family and friends. If you get out with your family and friends maybe more teens and adults would be in better shape and more healthly. Say we jump out of bed, gets some breakfast and head to the park to gets an excrize with your family and friends. Alot of family and friends i think spend way to much time on the computers or there labtops because if they are on the computer to long then they will not want to go outside and get excrise with there friends. More and more people use the computer. But not everybody agrees on this statement. What I think it would be better to solve the problem and have everybody get outside and get some freshair with family and friends. But some people don't think that is the right thing to go. People that think those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Well I don't think that is the way to go because you need to get outside to get some. Freshair with people. But if you want to go on the computer you can but I think it should be only for a little bit then because some people have a bissness that they have to work on when they are at work. Sometimes people have to work on there computer every day so if that is the case they I think they should be alouded to use the labtop or computer. But if you are a teen you should only go on if you have to f you needing the internent or writeing a paper. But if you going to go on to just go on to just talk to friend then that is a waste of time in somebody life. Well at least my life it is. I think as a teen you shold be to work on studying on doing your homework instead of being on the computer because I think it would be better to make sure your grade are not making you fail in your school carvee in life. So that is why it is best to make sure you aren't on the computer all the time talking to your friends on the computer all day because it could make you fail in life. I would only go on for a little bit to talk to your friends. That is why I think it is not right to spend all your time on the computer. Jump outside and in goal the outside weather with friends and family meabers. I hope teen and adult get outside from now on because it would be better for allof us and everybody would be heathly. If they tri this program. If you tri this program it will really work to all of you tri proise it will work and you will be heathly and not feel bad about yourself.",0

I believe that why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she is telling the reader and herself In my point of view that once again she do work in the garden to see if it catches her interest. I believe that the author is trying to express this because in the beggining of the story the author shows no interest in the garden or any interest of the world around her. For example when she was supposed to buy just seeds for the garden she went and used some of her mothers money to buy herself a big mac. So In conclusion I believe that what I wrote clearly states how the author feels and why she ended they story the way she did.,0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when attempting to put a dock for dirigibles on top. In order to make New York City the most modern city for travel, Al Smith attempted to put a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. They did finish constructing the mooring mast, although the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened. The stress of the people boarding the dirigible could cause damage to the original framework. Once it was finished, there were NUM1 attempts the board passengers onto the blimps. Although, they both ended in failure. The builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws. Winds could blow the blimp strayed into another building. Also, if a dirigible made of hydrogen was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to the high flammability of it. Finally, there was an existing law that airships from flying close to urban areas. The architects of the mooring mast were not able to overcome these challenges.",0

"In my opinion, I believe that if the only purpose of it is to read it then it should be in a library. Magazines, comics, books, music, and movies should be one hundred percent accessible through a library mainly because many people can learn many different things in many different ways such as visual leaners which are people who learn better by looking and observing the topic. The listeners which are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves. And lastly, the readers, who can do all of the above and read!         I know not all people are literate but maybe visiting a library once in awhile would help them with it. but in order for that to happen, that library must have something more than just things to read because many illiterate citizens that have to work their way up to being able to read. I hope understand through my point of view     All I'm trying to do is to make sure everyone has a chance to learn how to read because being able to read opens up many possibilities but some people havent gotten to the reading stage yet. Why not start learning in a nice, calm, relaxing township library",0
"Some materials could be seen as offensive to some people. It could have language, racial slurs, or anything else one might find offensive. In my personal opinion I believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose.     These books or movies are put out there for entertainment or learning purposes. Some things did happen, such as the LOCATION1, that many people would like to forget but no matter which way you take it, it happened and we can't change it. This can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place, so they will not do it.     Language is a big part of today's world and many do not appreciate a bad word. They put these in movies to emphasize somthing big because everyone will remember that word. I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out, but for some movies a certain word could make or break the scene. Some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie. A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count but the stroy line is phenominal. What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing, it's the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time.     As for books in libraries, we should make a seperate section for these offensive materials so that a young, innocent child does not wonder across them. Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a speical sticker on the book to warn parents as well.     In conclusion, offensive materials are not always bad and should not be removed from shelves, just mabye to a different location. Let the people read what they want to read.",0
"My sister PERSON3 and my niece PERSON2 had just came down from LOCATION2. It had been three years since I last seen them. When my brother PERSON1, my sister CAPS1, and I went over to my dads for the weekend we all decided we would go camping over by the beach. That morning we all woke up early and packed everything in the car. My dad and brother did most of the work while us girls got ready. After everything was packed we were off to LOCATION1. LOCATION1 is a small little town surrounded by mountains with absolutely nothing but a couple of houses, a park, a river, and forests all around you. My dad built a small one roomed cabin there a few summers back. It had a wood stove in one corner, bunk beds fulfilling almost half the cabin, and a counter that was always messy with all the food and supplies that we would bring. The whole ride over we were all messing with each other giving one another horse bits, the claw, and pulling on other peoples seat belts so that it would tighten across there chest. We were also telling PERSON3 funny stories about one another trying to embarrass them. When we got on the gravel road my dad started making the car slide back and fourth scarring CAPS1. While everyone else was laughing about it she was screaming. That TIME1 we all decided to go to bed early so we could wake up and get ready to go to the beach before noon. CAPS1 was the only one actually wanting to go to sleep. Everyone but CAPS1 was trying to make fun out of the rest of the TIME1. While everyone else was taking CAPS1 was yelling at them to go to sleep and be quite. PERSON3 and PERSON1 started yelling random stuff just to make her mad. When everything was silent one of them would yell something like, its not to late to sleep like a baby CAPS5 CAPS6. CAPS1 would start yelling while everyone else just busted up laughing. That TIME1 was one of the funnest nights there. Everything was hilarious that TIME1 but when look at it now it wasn't all that funny it was just stupid. I believe we made the most fun out of the TIME1 as we possibly could. It has become one of my most vivid memories. We all look back at it and laugh.",0

"To whom it MONTH1 concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about forein places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about forein places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Aslo, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history calss, I had to do a report on the state of LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Seecond, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using mytexts and running over the phone bill every mont. My dad has a facebook too, he talks to people he hesn't seen since he moved heve from the LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, aol, and myspace. Lastly computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to see that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on tv. When I went to a skate board demo at skate lair I had tons of fun. The other day though, I started thinking about it. I went on youtube and type in""nike sb skate lair demo"" and clicked on it. i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face! i was so exited. Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount.",0

"I feel as we are letting kids these days do as they feel, and do what ever they want. We are making them think that we don't care what they are involved in, but thats not true. We need to set boundries for what kids should and shouldn't be able to do. We need to show them that we know what they doing.     I think that there should be an age policy for libraries. If there are any books that have any types of adult content, they should be in the adult section. If you ever wanted to check out books, movies, or magazines from that section you would have to be eighteen or older. If that was to much to ask for then you should at least have the parents sign a concent form.      Book, movies, and magiznes with any type of adult content can be harzardess to child, whether its through their actions or behaviors. It MONTH1 effect their lives depending on what age they were introduced to such things. We need to show them that we care.     I know from personal experiences that being exposed to this, drasticly changes people, not over time but quickly. Now a days the media is portarying that money, alcohal, fame, and drugs are good things. This is what we are putting into our movies and books and magazines, and putting into the children of CAPS1 heads. We are telling them that its ok, but its most certanly not.      These are all the reasons why we should put cencorships and restrictions on libraries. We are letting the children of CAPS2 grow up to fast and introducing them to things way to early. In a way we are brain washing them on how to live a destructive live, through adult oriented things",0

"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced obsticles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. One obsticle the builders faced was that they had to modify the buildings framework in order to install the mooring mast. The builders had to modify the building because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure wood have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below.""

You can find something else to read that you'll enjoy or your friends and family MONTH1 like,                    CAPS1 second reason is that you can learn from stuff that MONTH1 offen you and any kind of way. Such as this magazine I read about black males sagging there pants many white people that seen there pants below there waist had something negative to say about the young men. They only jugde a book by its cover because they didn't know nothing about the person, that they was talking about and one of the black males was a honor student in high school that was going to attend a white college. And when many whites started to find out they begin to question the young man about how he dress and why. He told them this is a free country I can do what ever I like and whites liked that he spoke up for his self.                               So with CAPS1 reason being said I find it not right to remove certain materials,such as books, music, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. So I hope you enjoyed reading CAPS1 essay. If you have any arguments or questions you can surely contact me",0
"The author concludes Winter Hibiscus with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life. In the story, Saeng has come to the United States from Vietnam and it is quite a change. Also changed are the plants. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, but it is different. The mother in the story says, Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus. The hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes. The final paragraph talks about snow melting, geese returning and the hibiscus budding. These are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme. This adds more understanding to the storys message. Additionally, the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful, which gives the reader a positive feeling. The tone adds to the theme of the story.",0
"I think  the author concluded the story like that is because it was cold outside. I also think that the author is trying to say is that when she wrote this letter it was cold outside and she wouldnt take the test until it was warm again because of the cold. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.",0
"In paragraph NUM1 it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" These reasons are one that is due to flamable gases, a second is due to nature itself, and the last is an already existing law.     As said in paragraph NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium."" CAPS1 how Flammable hydrogen is they didn't want that above a highly populated area.     Paragraph NUM3 now states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" CAPS2 the dirigible would not be stable enough.     Finally I said in paragraph NUM4. ""There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""     CAPS3 there was never a chance of a dirigible being able to dock there, as stated above.",0
"I beileve that using computers is a good idea and will help people. So many people all over the world have computers. Computers are good because they help kids learn, communicate with others, and help teach responsibility. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I beileve that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy the PERSON1 you are still learning by taking care of them. There are so many good websites that you can go on like ORGANIZATION1. People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assingment why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for hearg kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends. There is a thing called CAPS1 or ORGANIZATION2. You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want. There are also websites you can go on too communicate with people from all around the world. It is pretty cool because you don't have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. Peoples language could be different or there personality. So many communicating things make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. Kids who use internet know that poeple need privacy and that comes with responsibility because you should know that. If someone dosen't want to be bothered then don't bother them that has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. That is how you get kicked off of these things. Another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money. Not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have. Don't brag, but just know you are privleged for a computer. These things are the reasons computers are good. So if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad.",0
"the mood created by the author in the memoir is how he was living with his family in the house.     the specific revelant in the story is said ""the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friend and endless celebration,"". and what he want to show how he was living with many people and he is a immigrate",0
Some times when people take a long time my family is patent. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short my family is really patient wether its sitting in the office or deployed to a new country my family is always patient.,0

Computer can help you earn in many ways one way you could learn from computers is students can go online and got information for their school projects by finding this information it can help the students get better grades.

"In Marcia Amidon Lüsted excerpt The Mooring Mast, is about the empire state that was built to being the tallest building. There are copious of ways of the builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt it states, ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium (hydrogen is more flammable)"". This CAPS1 proves how it's likely to destroy the whole entire empire state with Fire. Another CAPS1 that portrays how builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there when it states,... ""Dangling high above pedestrians on the street was practical nor safe"". This CAPS1 CAPS4 the safty of the people walking on the CAPS5 and what if they get hurt. finally another CAPS1 that portrays the obtacles the builders faced when it states, ""... blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings"". This CAPS1 proves if the dirigibles blow the empire it's not the only building in danger others around it too.",0
"There is CAPS28 more fun than going to a friends house after church. It is like a comic relief in life after a r rough message to CAPS10 heart. In CAPS1, going to your friend's house is even better when your friend is, to say lightly, kind of crazy like CAPS10 are. Which for my story, could be interpenetrated as a bad thing, but for me it is CAPS28 but a great thing. My friend and I have had some of the craziest time together, and the funny thing is we CAPS6't have to be doing anything illegal too! Its such a bonus! We get our giggles from cleaning, playing with magnets, and watching theVampire CAPS2, and much more. Strange? Yes. Fun? To much. Let me tell CAPS10 of somethings that have happened to my lovely friend and I . First, like always, there is a DATE1 and I'm heading over to my good friend's house. Its a very short walk, I leave my church by twelve and am there by twelve o' five. I'm up the steps, I'm to her door, I open it. Bark bark bark! ""CAPS3 up, PERSON1,"" CAPS4 yells from another room. The snowzer pup come and greet me. He knows CAPS11 better. The one dog eats rocks for CAPS5 sakes. But DATE2, CAPS15 has her reasons to yell, and be a little grouchy.  ""I didn't realize how many dishes there were! My sister will freak if CAPS15 knows your here and they are not done."" ""CAPS6't worry, I'll help CAPS10, and we'll get them done before your sister notices.""  CAPS7, we are off. CAPS4 wonders the house frantically for dishes and putting them in the sink. CAPS7, I work on putting the clean ones in the dishwasher away. We hear a sound from her sisters room, and we jump. CAPS4's sister sounds like CAPS15 is waking up but CAPS7 snorts and the noise ends. CAPS7 we get back to work. When we got done, we CAPS21 slumped on to the couch looked at each other. We CAPS21 were tired and our hearts were still pounding. CAPS7, her sister snorts again. we laugh hysterically, and her sister tells us to CAPS3 up. CAPS7 another day, I come over and we are CAPS21 really hungry. We CAPS21 haven't eaten all day long and go into her kitchen. ""CAPS8 do CAPS10 wanna eat,"" CAPS15 asked me. ""I CAPS6't know. CAPS8 do CAPS10 wanna eat, "" I replied back. ""I CAPS6't know, "" the endless cycle. But, CAPS7 my eyes cross paths with a bag of chocolate mint chocolate chips. CAPS4 fallows my gaze and see the bag, and smiles. ""CAPS9!!"" I'm delighted, "" CAPS9!!"" we CAPS21 shout in joy of the idea.  We get everything together, and begin making CAPS9. Now, CAPS21 of CAPS16 are really, ""great cooks,"" so when we were faced with ""who should flip the CAPS9"", it was a CAPS11 brain-er.  ""CAPS10 do it!"" ""CAPS11, CAPS10 do it!!"" We argued till I realized the pancake was about to burn, and CAPS7 I did indeed, ""do it,"" for the sake of chocolate mint chocolate chips CAPS9. But, when I flipped it, it didn't really want to end its embrace with the hot pan, and broke into pieces. Many ""stupid pancake's"" were said and spread all over her kitchen. But, eventually we ate and were happily full. CAPS7 came another DATE1, and this time CAPS4 had a surprise. ""I found this really cool show!! Its calledVampire CAPS2!"" I thought for a moment, ""CAPS14."" CAPS15 immediately dragged me to her computer where CAPS15 had them down loaded. I thought to myself, ""are these a cheep knock-off ofTwilight?"" We began watching them and they did seem cool, I liked them a lot.  The vampire brothers were in turmoil with each other, yelling and interrogating each other. ""CAPS16 CAPS19 of how her blood tastes!""  I paused the none existent thought in my head, ""CAPS8 did he say?"" ""CAPS16 CAPS19 of how her blood tastes,"" CAPS15 looked at me. I crack up laughing, ""CAPS20. I thought he said, CAPS16 CAPS19 CAPS8 her butt tastes like, wow I feel bright!""  CAPS21 of us start laughing like crazy at the very stupid thing I had said. We laughed the rest of the night with CAPS16 that. We finish watching a couple episodes and CAPS7 my mom shows up. I get my coat and the rest of my junk, and head out the door. the dog is still barking, but CAPS4 comes out the door with me, we give each other a hug and say our good byes. ""CAPS23 I'll talk to CAPS10 later, CAPS4, "" I say heading down the steps ""CAPS25, see CAPS10 at school tomorrow.""  ""CAPS26. And see CAPS10 next DATE1!"" I yell from the car window. CAPS15 yells back, ""CAPS27!"" CAPS28 is more fun than that, a friends house on a DATE1 TIME1. Especially with a couple of crazies things, like me and my buddy, dirty dishes, a stupid dog, CAPS9 that stick to the pan, andVampire CAPS2 with my poor hearing.",0
"CAPS2 has come to my attention that there is a massive increase in people using computers in society. CAPS2 can have its positive effect on people, but too much of CAPS2 isn't a good thing. This is why I want to tell everyone about negative effects of the computer on people. We all know using computers helps people with all different kinds of things. They can help with business, interacting with family and friends, and you could even just use CAPS2 for entertainment. Some negative effects that some people don't know, or maybe just ignore, are things like they can keep you from exercising, exploring nature, and you could spend so much time on your computer, that you could get addicted. There should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern. So I think that we should try to combine what people like to do on computers, with what they should be doing more often, like exercising. Maybe we could tell people that they can use their computers to contact people like friends and family to go out and make plans to exercise and have fun outside so theyre not stuck on the computer all day. We all know that computers can be a good and bad thing. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places and people in the world, and so much more. They also have bad effects, but that doesn't mean we should take them away from people. And you shouldn't be outside all the time, for the whole day. So I think there should be a limit on how many hours people spend on the computers per day. This way, people get what they want, and they have some time off of CAPS2, too. Obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern. I hope I have persuaded you with my well-thought out thoughts and ideas. And hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society.",0
"A happy, grateful, and proud mood is expressed by the author in this memoir. The author, Narciso, expressed a grateful and happy mood by describing things his parents did for him that he was grateful for, as well as happy to have. ""... a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (CAPS1 NUM1) The author also expressed his pride in the story, by stating and describingwhat his parent's did that he was proud of. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" (CAPS1 NUM2) ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.""

"CAPS2 are very dangerous to the modern day socity and how we are connected to them. So I belive that these atroshish things should bery well be disposed of. There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to menshon the fact that the enviorment is already falling apart. The way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers. First how hamful it today is PERCENT1 of CAPS3 own computers. In america theres only PERCENT2 is nature with nice forest but as people reporduce more will be gone forever due to expantion. So be one of the NUM1 out of NUM2 that instead of staing iside views the great things the earth has to offer. Next these computers our little robots that are really taking over the world and its getting very dangerous with how much it's destroying the ability for humans to breath this happens because theres a hipno disk in all computers making us stay close sufficating us like a deadly drug it's a horrible addiction. Lastly PERCENT3 of deaths are due to CAPS2 overloads imagene all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every NUM3 minets I mean on average NUM4 hours a day your looking at a CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us and knone knows how to talk about it. Secondly, millions on top of millions live in the LOCATION1 NUM6 keep on their computers for ours on a time you would think that their alone in every NUM7 people are done the rest are being killed by chatting on the CAPS2 and letting their life flow right out of the window. Now interaction is harmful as you already know but you forgot NUM8 a day do elligal things on the internet like download music wich they shouldn't be they could be put away for up to NUM9 years for this talk about an iteraction, with the police. Lastly web inter action like myspace they haves satified sexual effenders who could come to your house at only time and take you away would you like that to happen you could never see your family in every NUM10 people PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to myspace alone stand up out of danger. Thats a harmful work it is. Finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up. These people are considered are mad and dangerous with laywars who want to get you. One in every NUM11 people can't keep up with payments. Next did you forget about those other PERCENT3 who dont have computers they are living the life walking with CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Lastly and unfortunatly those PERCENT1 perstent witho computers are likly to die within the next NUM12 years due to a dealy poisin that the compute diliveres to your brain. In conclution this world can be one of the more angerest. So come to gether get a friend go for a run now and then. No friends go talk see your family instead of one of those vertual meaings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the CAPS2 world and how it wants your money. Now what we need to do is attak the robots back. People should go for a run cut of some of the obisity from sitting down all day lose NUM9 pounds or more. Remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie CAPS2 room. Get outside go for a road trip save life humanity your fellow niebor your family.",0
"Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there such as safety, weather, and policies. One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles.",0
"I think that computers have a negative affect on us! How many people have acess to a camputer daily in america.. NUM1 and how many people go on at least an hour a NUM2.

I got up and got all the materials and sit back down. After In done writing have to put all the materials away and then put the letter in the mailbox and walk all the way back. Well this is what I had to do. Now think how you write an email sitdown and move your fingers. Do you see the difference? CAPS2 instead of getting a good walk to your friends house to talk to you just in himer. Did you know that you can literally but from on your computer. Instead of around with this that can add anything you your computer gives away information they information lead to that and then everthing you have wouldbe gone. All this so you can go online. Believe it or not, you can phisically get hurt for being on the computer, to long.

This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plants rebirth and feels she can start over again to and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vowes to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms.",0

"To whom it MONTH1 concern, I feel that computers are a great in most people lives. One you can use them for almost everything. two computers are good for you in many ways. It shouldnt affect dailey schedule or just being with your family. People can use computers for almost everything for one their are hundred of websites on the computer. For example, you can play games all different kinds, you can also chat with people, litsen to music, watch videos, look for places and a whole lot more. Computers are very useful in many different ways. Computers are also good for you. They help with you eye cordination. You can also go online and do practice on math, social studies, etc. The internet also has a lot of eduacting games whiten is good for people who had that extra help. It also helps you with you hand cordinations because on the computer you need to know how to type. you get realy good at it you can type without looking. A computer can not get between you dailey schedule or whay u do with your family. Because a computer is a computer you go on it if you need something or you go on it just for fun for example i havea computer at my house and someone goes on it everyday and it never affect what everybody does us kids still go to school my parents still go to work, we eat dinner together we do what we have to do, and the computer never gets in the way. As my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses. One you can use them for almost everything. Two computers are good for you. Three i shouldnt affect your daily schedule in anyway.",0
"Dry, thirsty, tedious-all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isnt any where near a town that could help him. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time. Secondly, He is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water. He went fourty miles before he reached the first town to stop at. He also is on a bike, So that doesnt leave him much room to carry water along. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55. He hasnt acceded 12 mph. All to gether, the cyclists trip seems to be adventure that takes a lot of heart.",0

"People all judge things differently. Thats why I feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books. What MONTH1 be found as a offenisve book to one person might not to another one. If there are people saying that the certain books are offensive, then they should take them out of the library. You shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive.          What might be offensive to one person MONTH1 interest another. The person that doesn't think it is, should have the right to read the book. That would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive. The person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more. They will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it.           I personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and MONTH1 have some violence in them. If the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter read or waching then it would be wrong. The mother would be taking away what I like to read and watch. Thats not fair at all. A way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group; therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group.          I understand the fact that some people take things offensively. Also that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group. They have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them. It is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening. It wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library.                     All people have different views about things. You can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it. People have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not. Not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way. I like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is",0
"The libraries have to worrie about enough as it is with people not retuning books and stuff in. They do not want to lose there books, music, movies, magazines just because some people find the offensive. Why would we have to talk something out that offens one person but no one else has complainded about it being offensive. I know that you are asking me to thank like you to be able to see why it is offensive but i dont see how a book is going to be offensive.     When someone finds something that looks offensive then they do not have to take. There are people out there would would read something that is offensive to them so that they can lern from it. There is no reason why if you dont like the libary that you can not go to a differnt one. There is no reason for you to have to get so offensive of books because the authors is just trying to get their point accross and expressing their feeling on the subject.     The way that i look at it is that you have two oppions. The frist being deal with it and go to the libary and get books. The second is dont go to the library if your going to be able to find something offensive. But know if you pick the second one then you must realize were ever you go you are going to find some thing the will make you feel offensive so your might as well just get over it and say yea i will go because its all around me. yes i know what you must be thinking why if its not a big deal then why dont you just take them out. Well you want an answer and i will give you one. Those books mayne you don't want to read them. But what if someone eles does its not fair to get reed of something just because afew people find it offensive know is it?     There for i say that no we are not going to take books, music, movies, magazines and anything eles out of the libraries. You will just have to deal with what you dont want in here its not like were going to make you read something that you take offensive to. We will not going to get reed of the books, music, movies, magazines or anything else that we the library has. That is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library",0
I think that the books sould not be removed because people know what they are reading and if they dont like the book they sould leave it. There is no reson that the people would whant to remove any book for any reson because alot of people like different kinds of books     If they would remove any books they would be alot of people mad because those people mighit of really liked that book and wanted someone else to read it. That book might of also been in there family for a really long time and they want everyone in there family to enjoy that book.     It would also not be good to remove a book because if they remove a book they have to get more books and that would cost more money to get more books it will also waste more papper.     Another reson that it would not be a good idea is that if you get another book replace the old one the people might not like the new book and the place where they have the book at will lose money and will not be good for them.     So thays what I think would be my opinion about removeing a book it would not turn out very good and the book store will lose alot of money because they got rid of a good book and broght back a reallty bad book,0
"I think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldnt get to read what they want to. I read world war CAPS1 books, and a wide selectionof others and if they take those away just for being offensive id have nothing to read. If i find a book i think is offinsive I just put it back and dont get it.     I think they should age books like this book is for ages NUM1, and especialy movies and magizines because kids dont need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohole and murder. I dont think music is a big deal because music isnt very influincial but music videos are soometimes bad. Movies sometimes go to far though and i wouldnt want my kids watching them, so i wouldnt mind if they take thos off the shelves if they are offinsive.I dont think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what there kids are reading anyway. I would at least check the book or magazine before geting it for my kids and so should other parents.theres always going to be offinsive books and movies so its the parents job to make sure there kids dont get thos kinds of books or magazines.",0
"The story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit was a rough undergoing story about a cyclist going though rough climate and terrain. In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see. In paragraph NUM1 the text says Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke. is empressed how the climate felt. This explains the heat and how he felt during this experience. This whole trip sounds suffering.",0
"The mood that Narciso Rodriguez created was a very happy and uplifting mood. It makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that. You wish and hope that you could have a life like that where everyone will do anything for you and everyone is so close and they have dinner every night together. He makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live. That even though you left your family, friends, jobs everything is okay because you are with each other. You are with your family but they are not your blood family. They are having so much fun with people you just met because they are so excited that they made it to LOCATION1 and they are just having fun with their culture and tradition. The whole neighborhood is one big family they all call the older people who are living in their basement their grandparents when their real grandparents are in Cuba. It just makes you think about your family and all they do for you.",0
"When the Empire State Building was built, new ideas came into the heads of the architects. Unfortunately, the vision that they had of making it into NUM1 dock for limps proved to be unrealistic.The first challenge that they came across was how to attach a dock for a blimp to the building without creating such stress to the building's framework. The building could potentially collapse with the added weight unless sixty thousand dollars' worth of framework strengthening was made.Another obstacle that the architects faced was nature. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were so strong that the blimps would be swaying too violently to allow for the pilots to dock them safely. The last reason that blimps could not be docked at the Empire State Building was that there were laws against aircraft's flying that low. It was actually consitered illigal to dock the blimp there because it would have to be flying low enough to approach the building. Due to these factors, the Empire State Building was unable to become a dock to support blimps.",0
"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, it patrays the mood of Narciso home and relationship with his parents. The mood created by the author in the story is alive, hopeful and cultural. Narciso said that his parents created a traditional Cuban home alive with Cuban food and music. Thats stating the mood was very cultural. Throughout the story it was hopefull they left Cuba and only lived in a NUM1 room apartment but his parents were hopeful they would succeed. It was also very alive they always had someone other than their family at the table had doors open to family and friends. The Cuban music and food aroma drifted through the small place. Narciso Rodriguez will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home.",0
"A time when I was patient was when me and my cousin family went LOCATION1 and my sister was sick. Me and my other sister sat on my car. For about two and a half hours. My sister was getting mad but I just sat there patiently. My mom and sister were in the doctors office for the longest time! my sister ended up going to the doctors office three times. But I was very patient, when she wasnt at the doctor, all she wanted to do was lay down so we barely gat to do any fun stuff. By the end of the trip she was feeling better so my mom took us to do something fun. That was a time when I was patient.",0

"Some of the most interesting books that I have ever read are offensive in some way. I have even read excellent books that offend me. If we didn't have books and stories that offend us, then we would never really find out what offends us. That is why I don't think books, magazines, music, or anything of that nature that MONTH1 be found offensive in some way should be remover from the shelves.     If you think about, almost all books can be offensive or hurt your feelings. It just depends on how you feel about what has been written. Something that is offensive to one person or a group of people MONTH1 not be found offensive by another person or group of people. If we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them, then there would be no books left.      Writing is something you do when you want to express how you feel, or tell a story about yourself or someone else. Some authors MONTH1 do this in a very offensive manner. Others MONTH1 try to suger-coat how they feel about a person or certain idea. Either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive.     In conclusion, i feel that books that are found offensive or hurtful should be left on the shelves because, if we took all of them off, there would not be a very wide selection of books left",0

"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez. The mood of the reading could be described as grateful. I can sense this mood by some of the things Narciso Rodriguez mentions. The author would constantly say ""thank you"" to his parents for all the sacarfies they had to mak for a suitable living enviroment for Narciso. It also states that ""there was no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Over all, in the memoir of PERSON1 the mood can be mainly described as Grateful towards his parents, heritage and home.",0
The reason why they include the story with the paragraph is because they talk about the same thing. Then they probably included the story with the paragraph might have been to show the good relationship between the mother and daughter and how they can do things together. Then in the story they talk about going to Canada together.,0
I am going to tell you why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does is because it tells you that Saeng is confident. It also tells you she wont give up. And it shows that she is willing to take her ability to the next level. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.,0
"Falling in love, CAPS3 CAPS1 The falling part was easy, I remember the minute I fell in love with you. Everything about you shined, everything about you sparkled. You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We had the most fun that human beings were capable of. Every time we were together there was no thought in my mind that we were not happy together, no worry that you would ever leave. I never wanted to imagine life without you. As a child i had always had the title of the kid who smiles all the time, CAPS4 when i thought of you i got this glow. Everybody saw it. they would ask, ""CAPS2 have you been doing? Your so happy, I've never seen you like this before."" That, CAPS2 they saw in me was the power of love. CAPS4 something they did not see was CAPS2 we had together. When it was just me CAPS3 you CAPS3 one of us would do something CAPS3 neither of us could stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt from CAPS1 so hard. that is CAPS2 I love, I grew to love every part of you. Especially your laugh.  From CAPS2 i hear, they say the laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I would have to agree. Being able to laugh with someone, CAPS3 being able to be yourself CAPS3 not have to hold up this front, its magical. Its something that makes a relationship last. I guess its kinda like glue in sense. My brother CAPS3 i are the closest you can get to best friends, CAPS3 guess CAPS2 we do in our spare time? We laugh. Hes someone that i can be silly CAPS3 dumb CAPS3 goofy with CAPS3 he still laughs, CAPS3 he still loves me. :) CAPS4, although he is my brother it still holds the same respect, CAPS1 is great. It is also a stress reliever. My teacher told me so. My health teacher that is.",0
"Shafts of light escape through fogged windows casting a shadowed glare upon the surface of the table. A tremendous sign hovers on a wide oak shelf that borders the entire dining area. CAPS16 read's ""CAPS1's"" in great letters buried under decades of dust. My eyes dance among the plethora of mismatched antiques and statues strung throughout the room easily filling every crevice. These objects form a family of outliers, each individually unique belonging CAPS15 the restaurant. Huge posters of All-CAPS2 athletes tower among NUM1-inch flat screens while an acrid scent of molded wood and fermented beer lingers. Numerous bras fall from the ceiling of the bar that sits next CAPS15 the entrance. The sound of crunching echoes in my ears as waitresses maneuver over fallen peanut shells. That's CAPS4 sets this place apart from the others. The entire floor is littered with barrels of TIME1's broken shells and mashed peanuts as CAPS16 is custom for the customers CAPS15 throw them on the ground. Of course there's my family; a vivacious group of five squeezing our round frames into a booth that comfortably seats four. We seem CAPS15 mesh quite nicely with the crowd of miscellaneous objects dressed in our 'DATE1 CAPS3' attire of skirts and dress suits.  Distracted, I busy myself in the menu browsing for something with a little zest and a lot of calories. A loud smashing noise breaks my attention and I slide the newspaper style menu below my eyes. Across the table sits my grandmother; a petite old lady standing proudly at NUM2 who devotes her free time in attempting stand up comedy. I study the glass jar of ketchup she's holding and watch her pound the corner on a single peanut. The shell cracks open and ORGANIZATION1 picks out the nuts sweeping its kernels onto the floor. I giggle CAPS15 myself surprised at CAPS4 limits this old lady is willing CAPS15 go CAPS15. She proceeds CAPS15 repeat this process with ten more peanuts until the entire family has stopped in curiosity. Looking up, LOCATION1 pauses with the jar suspended in her hand. ""CAPS4? I'm just trying new ways of cracking open the nut."" LOCATION1 exclaims pausing for a comical response. With no reaction we resume position contemplating our meal choices. Minutes later a hefty waitress reeking of drugstore perfume and TIME1 nights hangover sets down glasses of water and drags off sluggishly. Raising his glass, CAPS5 motions us CAPS15 follow.  ""CAPS6!"" CAPS7 calls clinking each of our glasses in turn.  ""CAPS6! And CAPS6 CAPS15 cherry people!"" LOCATION1 pitches in. ""CAPS9 CAPS10!"" I shout automatically. Immediately my parents chuckle because my grandmother has never been funny. CAPS16's a joke that nobody in the family laughs at LOCATION1's comments but herself and that's how CAPS16 remains. Years ago, my brother deemed her jokes the ""CAPS9 CAPS10"" because she poses as a comedian but truly isn't. From then on, each time LOCATION1 would crack a ""joke"" someone was quick CAPS15 respond with yelling ""CAPS9 CAPS10!"" CAPS15 this day, she has neither improved nor given up daily opportunities CAPS15 attempt CAPS15 win over her audience. In quiet defeat LOCATION1 chuckles CAPS15 herself and focuses down on the menu. Seconds later she's back in the ring for round two.  ""CAPS16's noon. So are we having breakfast or lunch? Or should we have..brunch?! I'm dying here just laugh already,"" she pleads. For a moment we all just stare at her. Innocent eyes gaze back; the predator calmly sits awaiting the move of its prey. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, we eye each-other and the ribbon is cut. Tea party giggles erupt into hoarse cries as rolls of thunderous laughter echo through the room. I hand my mother a napkin which she uses CAPS15 dab jubilant tears. The thick wooden table shutters under the pound of my father's fist slapping the surface in hysteria. I laugh so hard my gut aches and yet I cannot understand why everything is so funny. All the while ORGANIZATION1 sits in pure delight, tickled by the success of finally earning a sincere response CAPS15 her notorious off-the-cut ""jokes."" CAPS16's a wonder we aren't thrown out of the restaurant. Customers in surrounding booths peer over the edge of their bench eying us with distaste. However, this isn't the first and certainly wouldn't be the TIME1 time my family causes a scene. Plain yet obnoxious jokes is a loosely run comradery in our family that always finds its spot in our books of lasting memoirs. The remainder of the meal was spent in bursts of giggles and we were more than kindly shown out the door once our meal was finished.  Its when you break into hysterics for no monumented reason and can't get through retelling CAPS16 someone else who doesn't find CAPS16 nearly as humorous.) CAPS16's those insignificant moments in life when we're reminded of who we are and the bonds we share. Laughter is a connection, a form of love that cultivates within society and in families with grandmothers such as mine, every ""CAPS9 CAPS10"" is worth CAPS16.",0
"CAPS2 MONTH1 be true that computers MONTH1 make people exercise less, enjoy nature less, and spend time with family and friends less but computers do benefit the society in many ways. Computers help students with homework and projects and they help communicate with other people. Besides the telephone, computers do have some bad things about them, too. Students need computers to help them complete homework and class projects. They help students create good presentations and students can use the internet for research. Having computers will help raise a students grades and help them have a more successful life in the future. Parents and kids can communicate long-distance friends andor relatives and they can talk to co-workers, bosses, teachers of their kids, and with their own childrenparents, too. Having computers would create more communication with some people and help keep in touch with family members. Besides all of the good things, computers do have bad qualities, too. They can lead to children seeing inapropriate sites, and maybe even a virus that crashes your computer! Most of the programs to get rid of viruses block children and adults from seeing inapropriate sites (like gambling, pornography, etc). We need a computer that is pre-installed with the best up-to-date virus protection system, that helps protect children, teens, and adults from viruses, inapropriate sites, and cyber-bullies. Having these will make a computer almost perfect! The computers everyone needs should help students learn, keep raising communication between people and be pre-uploaded with programs to protect people from viruses, bad websites, and cyber-bullies. Computers are needed, and without them, our lives would be extremely miserable.",0

"The mood Created by the author is CAPS1. I CAPS5 this because you can tell that the narrator doesn't take anything for granted. I know this because the CAPS2 parents was given a house, and since CAPS8 was part of the family, it was her duty to make that house a home as much as possible with her parents. I Know this because it CAPS7 it in CAPS3 NUM1, and NUM2.The author also gives a CAPS4 mood in this memoir. I CAPS5 this because in CAPS3 NUM1, and NUM4 it CAPS7 that CAPS8 is Cuban and italian, from Newark, New Jersey, and CAPS8 seems to be CAPS4 of who CAPS8 is and where CAPS12 from.

The title of the story is Narciso Rodriguez. The authro is the CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez The mood I think is this story the author gave was pretty good.

So to me I think this was a good story and I like it. The mood went right with it.,0
"There are many books that are not appropriate for childeren or teenagers, though they can still check the books out in the library. They can take them home, read it, and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age. Childeren check out rated NUM1 movies and rated CAPS1 movies and unedited CAPS2's and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at the age their age.     The libraries are supposed to make sure your NUM2 years of age before you check out a rated CAPS1 movie. Also you have to be a certain age to buy CAPS2's and games that are for the elderly teenagers. You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulger language. Today kids aren't as mature as they used to be. Things today are way different.     My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are bad but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either. I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulger things. It should have to be your parents decision to see if your ready or not.       My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think your ready. The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages. Although some people will not agree. There should be boundaries for teenagers and age privelages and they should respect them enough not to do them",0
"I strongly believe that computers are a big benefit to society these days. There is so much to learn on a computer. And it is a lot more fun to learn of off a computer than a book. For intinst, let's say a student had to do a report, but he couldn't get his hands on any book at all. All the student would have to do is type in a few words on the internet and hundreds of websites pop about any topic he wants to learn. Another reason that a computer benefits society is ways to keep in contact with family and friends if they live to far away. Like me for instints, I live far from my friends. And the only I could talk to them outside of school was on a computer. We would be able to talk in a chat room or on a game. The same goes with Family. Lets, say your childre go on vacation and wants to keep in touch. All you would have to do is type as much as you want and click send and its at the other computer instintly. But, if you was to write a letter through the mail, it would take maybe a week or two to reach your child or the other way around. But, most of all, there are so many cool things you can do on a computer. There are a bunch of games, to play, or videos to watch. You can make music and make money off of it. My favorite would have to be the computer programs. Flash macromedia is the best though. You get to make your own animation clips or even a movie. Computers are really fun to play on. a computer has so many advanrages in today society. Which i'm very thank full for computers and all of the great stuff you do. That is why I believe computers benefit society.",0
"Books are important in the life of human beings wheather they are for studies,entertainment, or any other use. On the other hand, are some books offensive to readers. If certain books are offensive should you stay away from that type of book or get rid of the book altogether. With this being said, Should certain material be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Some reasons against this are you are taught to stay away from bad things, some people have different views of 'bad', and even if they are offensive they do not need to be removed.     Some materials are offensive to some people but not to others. This is the case in anything for example movies, books, and daily life. Some people MONTH1 think the type of words used in a book make it bad, but to others that is what makes the book. For example to show the full amount of hatred for a character you have to use some offensive words. Another example is describing how horrible a person was killed, it is not enough to say he got stabbed and beat, you have to describe just how brutal it was to please some readers.       Another reason why books should not be removed is people are taught when to tell that something is offensive. If a reader discovers a book is offensive they should know to stop reading not finish the book then complain about offensive material. Also if a person rents a movie they know they aren't allowed to get an CAPS1-rated movie then they should get another movie. People should know to not get a book read about the offensive stuff without stopping then go complain. If a person was concerned about a certain material they could ask people or go online to see if it is offensive or not.     Even if a certain material is offensive it should not be removed. That is only the opinion of sombody. If the book was needed by somebody they would not be able to get it because it was removed. If material were removed because someone said it was offensive then ther would never be any more books. For the reason that anyone can be offended, so they might just say it was worse than it actually was because they are mad.      For those reasons materials should not be removed. What if everybody started saying things were offensive ther would not be any more books. People should not have the complete say in the removal of books. Otherwise people would complain just out of spite towards certain people's material. So do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.",0
"CAPS1 your computer ever crashed, and you needed to do a presentation? Well if so, that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper, the old fashioned way. Recently, there CAPS1 been a debate going on between experts about computers. Some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors. I believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people. I think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info. around the world, it's efficient for work and helps the environment, and lastly, it let's people stay in touch. Computers have a positive effect on people because it let's family members stay in touch. Emails are an example of this. Instead of mailing a letter, you are electronically sending it. The person recieves it quicker and can answer ina more timely manner. Also, social networking sites help families keep in touch. One example of this is facebook. You can see what the person is doing and chat with them using facebook chat. I relate to this. My cousin lives in LOCATION2, so I don't see him a lot. Through facebook, we can talk and update each other on our lives. Lastly, you can see pictures of your family. Many families have accounts on photo sharing sites. This enables them to see pictures or recent vacations or sporting events. They can comment and every member of the family can see how everyone lookschanges throughout the year. That is how computers let people stay in touch. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information. Computers teach you hand-eye coordination. When you type with a keyboard, you have to know where each letter is. This makes it possible to lok at the screen to recognize my errors. Hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know. Computers update you on world news. Many homepage on the internet have news engines built into them. These news engines keep people updates on major news events. For example, the war in LOCATION5, or more recently, the LOCATION3 and LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would be very behind on important news updates around the world. My last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment. Computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper. Throughout the year, CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters. With computers that number goes down into the thousands. Why you MONTH1 ask? Emails don't recquire paper. They are electronic, which means no paper. They are also environmentally friendly because news paper companies are going out of buisness. Due to online news paper news is becoming less and less popular. Computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations. There are so many programs to use, that making a big presentation could take minutes. That is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time. As you can see, computers have many positive effect on people. They let family members stay in touch, they teach you skills, and they are efficient for work while being environmentally friendly. That is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Let me ask you this question again. CAPS1 your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project? Now you know that computers make life efficient. What would you do without them? So now it's your turn, go out and buy a computer because you will be thankful you did.",0
"There was many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle faced was to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Those were some of the different obstacles they faced which caused the lack of success.",0

"CAPS2 I have learned that some experts say that people spend too much time on computers when they could be excercising or with friends and family. I, on the other hand, think otherwise. Computers are a great way to learn and communicate with others, here's why: CAPS3 of all, I would like to say how much computers help us in school. Most students use them every day. We can study for tests by looking for websites with lots of information and we can also research topics that we don't understand. For example, if you want to find out how planets form, you can just type it into a search engine and a list of websites will pop up. Another way we use computers in school is when we have to make projects. We can use different tools to set up a slide show while also looking up information on the internet. Lastly, the internet is also a way for teachers to communicate with their students. If the teacher sets up a blog, students can always see what the class is doing, what the homework is, and find cool links that will help them understand certain topics better. Another point I would like to mention is that the experts say that computers deprive us of time with family and friends when the truth is, its the opposite, computers actually take communication to a whole new level. For example, if you wanted to have a chat with an old friend, you could log right on to msn or aim and find out what's new in their lives. A second way to communicate with friend is by ORGANIZATION1, a cheap and easy way to contact friends outside the country. Next, you could go a bit more old fashioned and just write an e-mail. It will take longer to get a reply but its still worth the wait in the end. Lastly for parents who kids live far away, video chat is also a good way to communicate because you will be able to see them and hear their voice as well. Lastly, I would like to tell you about just how much we can learn by using a computer. You could just go to a search engine and search any topic in the world and you're bound to finds hundreds of results. It doesn't matter what your interests are because you'll always find great information. The internet also allows you to catch up on recent news such as weather. Next, there are websites that allows you to ask questions and get answers just as fast. You might have to check your sources to make sure they're reliable, but I believe it's still worth it. Lastly, if you are getting ready to go on a trip, you can check flight information with the click of a button. Or maybe you need to find out what the weather will be like, there are many websites for that. There are also websites that can help you learn about the place you'll be staying at as well. Next time, think twice about what you hear about computers because they really aren't all that bad for you. Sometimes it MONTH1 be better to go outside and play but computers do help you learn and communicate with others which are just as important.",0
"Folded In DATE1 it was right around DATE2, two of my friends and I were out riding quads laughing and having a great old time. They were teaching me how to do a wheelie on a quad. Soon after they started teaching me i figured out that what I had to do was hit all of my weight on the back end of the quad and f lore the gas so I could pop the front end up and I was just doing it fairly well from there on out. Well, when we were about ready to to go back up to the house one of my friends thought it would be super cool if we got a picture of one of us up on the front of the quad while the person driving pops a wheelie. To do this one of us sat on the front of the quad, one of us sat on the back of the quad and, one of us was driving. first thing we do when were all situated in the quad is that the driver pulls back a f lore's the quad (the driver doesn't need to slam down on the back of the quad because there is the extra weight from the person on the back)Which in turn pops the front end up. Then the person on the back jumps off and snaps a picture on their phone and then the person driving is supposed to brake and set the quad down. Lucky me I was the one that decided to sit on the front of the quad while my friend does a wheelie. While he was popping the wheelie either he pulled back to far and hard or he flored it for too long. So I was sitting on the front and it stayed up in the air for about five seconds and then the scary thing happened. The quad started leaning back so my friend jumped off and tried to hold it so I had some time to jump off but, I panicked and froze to the bar i was holding on to. Then the whole quad came down on me because my friend couldn't hold me up any longer. It slammed me into the ground, all NUM1 lbs. of it, it caused my shins to hit me in the face( I have a hard time bending my head to my knees let alone my shins)and it super hyper-extended my back so much that I was lucky I didn't break it. When it hit me into the ground it felt like my legs sprung the quad off of myself but, it was really just my friend pushing it off. After the pushed the quad off of me I was laying there for like NUM2 minutes laughing in pain for some reason that I can't remember.  After I was done screaming, yelling, and laughing in pain I got up and they drove me back up to the house. When we got back up there they handed me an ice pack and told me to go sit on the couch, I couldn't bend my back so I could sit down so I had to turn my back to the couch and basically fall onto the couch. While I was sitting there my back started to hurt excruciatingly bad so i thought if I lay flat on the floor it wouldn't hurt as bad and just like I thought it did. So I slept on the floor until morning because that was the only way I could get comfortable. The next day I woke up in really bad pain, it took me like two minutes to get off the floor it hurt so bad. shortly after I woke up I called my parents and had them come and pick me up from the house, I just barely got into the truck and my dad and I drove back to my house and i told my parents the whole story and my mom freaked out and thought I hurt myself extremely bad so she took me to the doctors office and he looked me over and told me I would just have to wait for my back to heal it's self and then i went home.",0

"Censorship has become a major part of the media now-a-days. It is everywhere: books, movies, songs, and television shows. The government is trying to make the children of DATE1 less corrupt, but they will end up learning everything that is censored for their friends and peers anyways. I feel censorship is a waste of time for the government. Children learn mature information sooner than they should in DATE1's society.     Censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to. It should not be put into more mature movies and music, such as movies with adult content and rap. Those are more of items for grown up and teenagers than for children. If parents allow their children to listen to and watch that certain media, then they must feel their children are mature enough and know enough to not be majorly effected by it. Censorship also ruins the quality of books, music, and movies.     Certain words help to better express people and their views. If they can not use the specific word they feel describes them the best, it tends to ruin the quality of their character. People cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language. I, myself, am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things I say. They are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself. There are probably better, more appropriate words to use when I am in public, but then I would not feel like I am being quite myself. I think censorship is corrupting our society.     The government is trying to control us with censorship. I am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them. This just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship. We should get rid of it. It is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others. People have to be careful of what they say, and I feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging. Censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media.",0
"What do you want your child being exposed to?    In my own opinion I believe that CAPS1 shouldn't be taken off the shelfs, because kids know what books are appropriate and innappropriate for them. This CAPS2 why the library has CAPS3 'kids' selction away from the 'adult' selction. They know their boundaries, and I don't think a librarian would let a child check out anything innappropriate. The library CAPS2 a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out.   Also, CAPS3 not just librarys', CAPS1 can be seen or heard from schools, on the radio, t.v. and video games. Any where you go they're more likely going to see innapropriate actions that take place. So as a parent CAPS3 your job to keep your child away from the things you don't want them to see or hear as much as possible.       The only way a child can be exposed to this CAPS2 if their parents are unattended and irresponsible. Someday your kids will ask questions about that that kind of stuff they hear or see at school from other students. Just be open and honest at the right time but in a mature clean matter.      I know alot of young children these days who are being exposed a lot from violent video games, music about drugs, alchol, and sex. CAPS1 really bothers me, because when I was their age I had no idea what CAPS1 even was or meant. CAPS1's wrong for the parents to let them be around that when they know CAPS1 has a label on CAPS1 saying 'CAPS10 CAPS11', 'CAPS12'  or 'NUM1'.      Every time I hear a child say something about this aweseome video game or cool new song they heard on the radio about drugs, violence and etc, the children tend to get younger and younger every time. I don't understand why parents let them be exposed to that unecessary stuff",0

"Katherine Paterson said ' If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. ' In this quote I think she was trying to get across that if someone picks up a book or a magazine and reads it and then puts it back and maybe its not the best book ever to them and they MONTH1 find it offensive, but someone else comes along and wants to read it and they MONTH1 not find it offensive, then you have two different view points on a book that MONTH1 be offensive to one person, but to another it MONTH1 not be. Different view points really effect how to censor books, because of how people are so different, there difference on how they feel about a book could effect what should happen to that book.     I dont believe that books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials such as those should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to someone. If they are found offensive to a bunch of different people then yes they should be removed, but if its only bothering one or two people but there are other people that agree that its not offensive, then dont get rid of it just because of a couple people. Take a vote maybe to see how many people agree and dissagree on keeping or getting rid of it then decide whether or not you should keep or get rid of it off of that vote. I think it would be more fair and satisfactory to take a vote on whether or not it is fair to keep or remove it. If someone has a memory about something they read or remember an experience from it and then someone else reads it and feels offened by something its not fair to the other person to get rid of it. Its especially not fair to the person with the memories and experiences.     So dont  remove books just because a couple people might find it offensive, take a vote to decide. Let more than just a few people deciede on behalf of the book. More than just a few people can make an impact on just one book, and you never know what differnt views you MONTH1 find from different people on just one book. People need to be able to discuss their veiws on the book and then bedate on whether or not to keep it, so dont choose to get rid of them without several view points on the book.",0
"The building of the Empire State building was a project which faced many obstacles. Due to the additional plan of building a mooring mast at the top of the building, A series of challenges and possibilities were forced to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the addition of a mooring mast to the top of the building, would significantly weigh down the building, adding stress to its frame. Because of this, over MONEY1 worth modifications would have to be made to enforc the building's frame and stabilize it is a whole. Laws and regulations about how high airships could hoover over urban areas also restricted the use of the mast as because the building was located in the middle of a city, a densely populated area with thousands of pedestrians below, it was clearly neither practical, nor safe. Furthermore, Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the success of the mast as because many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, this risked a fire hazzard. Lastly, strong winds and violent air currents all in all prevented the construction of the mast, as using the top of the building as a dock for airships maybe just a bit far fetched.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, new friends would have to include more money. Anything done so top of a building so large would have to be balanced by strengthening the foundation. According to paragraph NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the DATE1 ft. building. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring, the back would be left to sway in the wind, Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building outweighed the rewards. When dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was scrapped completely.",0

"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was lack of suitable landing area; ""so were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" Another obstacle was the wieght of a mooring mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which means they would have to modify the whole frame to bare the weight of the mooring mast which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Safety was also an issue. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York than the accident would be much worse. Another issue was the fact that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Because of the wind the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast.",0
"Upon taking up the task of building a mast for dirigibles to dock at, the architects encountered many obstacles which made the idea of a mooring mast unplausable. One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back would be free to swing and sway. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles to low over urban areas. These are the reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. While designing the mast, the architects faced problems including wind pressure, safety, and practicality. The frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. The foundation of the building, which was approximately NUM1 feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground in the words of Marcia Amidon Lüsted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.""",0
"Laughing, laughter.It's every where. Lots of people are laughing right now.Why not laugh though? It's good for you right? It feels good to laugh here an their. Well laughter can make your day great. It can help you get through hard times. It can help you cheer up your best friend to be happy. Well it really don't matter what the reason is, but its good to laugh. Laughing is great for you an it brings fun, joy, an helps you enjoy little more. My mom and I have a great relationship. Every time we are together, or we start talking we will laugh an crack each other up. Laughing has helped us get to having a great relationship were we can tell each other anything. I can go to her any time an ask her for help. I can go an talk to her any time I need to now. Be for we had a great relationship she wasn't doing to good she was involved in not to good of things. She was very depressed too. Ill tell you a little about it.   My day started off as a normal school day, I got up got ready, got on thus to school then be for I new it I was on the bus on my way home. I get off a block or two away from my house and then I walk home. I walk and walk, an about ten minutes later I get up to my house. I go to my room an put my bags down on my bed and go say hi to my mom. I walk into her room an shes sitting their in a chair. I had asked her if she wanted to go on a walk. Well of course she said yes.She gets her shoes on an I do the same.We walk down are drive way an that's where the walk starts.        We started walking down the road after we got to the end of are drive way. We walked straight for about five minutes, then take a right.We walk that way for about ten minutes an turn left. Their is a little store on that coroner. We stopped their to buy some water an some snacks on the walk. After we get done we start walking east on the road. When I looked back at my mom she look like she was having a really bad day. Like anyone i asked her what was wrong. She talked to me about everything and she seemed really sad, and depressed. From that I knew i need to talk to her an make her laugh. We never had the best relationship because she was always gone hanging out with friends. I knew if i could make her laugh, an help her get better, it would help us get along better an help each other out in the long run. I love my mom an I hate seeing people down. I though all this in my head. Being around me makes everyone laugh.  The walk was about three to four miles long. for the rest of the time I got her to laugh an laugh the whole way back. It made her feel a lot better i know that. Later that day she came in my room and we played some bored games and watch a movie or two. We really just talked and hung out for the rest of the day. We went on a couple more walks for the next month or two and we got a good mother an son relationship. We were both happy this had happened. About two months from the first walk w had she came up to me and hugged me and told me thank you for helping her out with what she was going though. I think laughter is a great thing in life. For me it helped me out a lot in life an it helped me save a relationship with my mom. I love laughing, and I love making people laugh it is fun to laugh an fun to make people laugh. Laughter makes great friendships. It can have a lot to do with your life. I hope this helps you laugh more and makes you try to be funny an have people laugh with you.",0
"In the article "" The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it is apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, during the attempt of trying to dock dirigibles. The dirigibles themselves could be a hazard. ""... Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""In likes of what had happened to the German airship Hindenburg, officials didn't want a similar disaster to occur in downtown New York. Also, the dirigibles light mass would make it a target to high, forceful winds."" The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currets."" This reality caused fear that a zeppelin could potentially be blown into a spire of some sort on another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile lining. The law also caused obstacles for docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building ""... dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law thwarted many of the would-be attempts of mooring these. Mooring dirigibles was a dream talked about in, ""The Mooring Mast,"" however that soon never had the chance to come true.",0
"Do you believe libraries should remove items some people find offensive? Do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them? CAPS2 is a major problem that many people don't think about often before acting. Here are some situations many people run into:     If one person finds a CAPS1 offensive but no one else does, should CAPS2 be removed? Many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some peoples' opinions. This is because they know people like CAPS2 and they know people don't; they wonder whether or not they should remove the item because a few people find CAPS2 offensive, (this can range from books, music, movies, magazines, etc.). People often think they do what is best for everyone by asking the library staff to remove something they think is offensive. Honestly, they're only helping the people that want to have CAPS2 removed and don't say anything, that is if the library removes the offensive item.     If the library removes the offensive item, they MONTH1 lose a customer, if they don't remove the item they MONTH1 lose a customer. So they are faced with a dillemma, 'remove the item or don't remove the item?' CAPS2's a tough decision to make especially when they MONTH1 lose more than a few customers based on either choice. So what do they do? They MONTH1 poll the customers and see what they think, they MONTH1 do nothing at all, or they MONTH1 remove the item to keep the person happy. The problem is what happens if CAPS2's a friend who liked the item and you don't want to hurt their feelings because the item has been there forever and they love CAPS2 so much, but can't afford to buy CAPS2 at a store. What do you do then? People often don't want to think of other people's' feelings andor the decisions they would have to face over something as small as 'an offensive' item, and they say things that they wouldn't normally say just to get said item 'out of their sight.' CAPS3 is they just don't want to agknowladge other people's' choices, feelingings, opinions, etc.     So what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library? Would you ask for CAPS2 to be removed? Say nothing? CAPS2 is your choice in the end, but not all people have the same tastes in books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that you do. So think about other people's' possible feelings, thoughts, opinions in mind before making a decision.",0

Another reason is that it helps people learn about different cultures, religions, or traditions. The reason why some peope think that computers have a negative effect on people is because people are spending more time on the computer than spending time with their family.

"Library books offensive? The right to remove a book or not isn't up to us ,people, per our opinions. If someone has an issue with the book; next time don't get it. I know that we shouldn't have the right to remove books from the librarys. It's not up to us to make that choice.     I know people sometimes find somethings wrong or inappropriate in a book at the librarys', but if it wasn't to your liking don't read the rest of it or refer it to a friend. I have had problems with this before. I went to check out a book and my mom said that she didn't like the topic that it was about: honestly its her opinion. A person should have a right to hisher opinions but it shouldn't affect someone elses. One person MONTH1 really like the book and someone else MONTH1 hate it, obviously their are people out there who enjoy that type of book so there isn't a really good reason to get rid of it. The only person who should have a say in getting rid of a book would have to be the librarian. That person knows what is acceptable and what isn't for the library. If it includes something graphic or racist, you can talk to them about it in a clam conversation, because they maybe a librarian but they dont read every single book that is in the library.      Some items can be offensive to some but not others. The library is there for knowledge and entertainment. We can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing a big ordeal  because their could be reasons why things are where they are. You need to leave the choice up to the person who is educated on the matter who is in charge of the library",0
"Offensive much? Thats what multiple people feel towards curtain books. For instence if CAPS5 was the bible and you were an athiest, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible MONTH1 be offensive and hurtfull to you. I feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books then we would have nothing left to read. You see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects. I feel that they are a resourse that is very helpfull, and multiple times knowledgeable on many grasping subjects.      First, besides books, we have magazines. If we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for. Second there would be less gossip. Most magazines are about PERCENT1 gossip about the recent break-ups, and make-ups, of todays modern celebritys. I feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings, also its offensive the way that some famous people act. I strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves.     Lastly there is music. Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. Don't you remember the song, 'We CAPS1't CAPS2 the CAPS3?' CAPS4 if you don't then i'll tell you a little about CAPS5. CAPS5's about america, things that have happened in the past and were a big deal. In the chorus CAPS5 says, '-we CAPS1't CAPS2 the CAPS3,- but we tried to fight CAPS5. CAPS5's always been burning since the worlds been turning.' CAPS5's a song that is about americans saying that they CAPS1't cause panic and such things, but that since the begining of time CAPS5 already was. The song inspired many of the famous singers you CAPS4 know. Elvis CAPS6 is one of the many that you should know. We should keep music out so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others. Music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and give hope to americans. Without mucis there would be chaos.     Last and furthermore is movies, where would we be without movies? We need movies, not just for our intertainment, but some of the best movies are historical events. Events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past. For instince the movie CAPS7, and LOCATION1, even the movie The CAPS8 CAPS9, they all help us picture events that have happened and are very enjoyable but also very educational. We should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind.     In conclusion I hope I have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly. We need books and music to inspire and electrify the world, and magazines we need not. We all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives, and we need education. Not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see. I hope I have made a positive inpact on your thoughts, and feelings.",0

"One of the original purposes of the Empire State Building was to be a loading dock for dirigibles or blimps. This was meant to help New York be a leader in modern traveling. Yet there were many obstacles that eventually put an end to the idea of a mooring mast. A major problem was nature itself. The wind on top of the building was constantly changing because of the air currents. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the mast. The idea of weighting the back was immediately ruled out because of the danger imposed on the pedestrians on the street. Also there was a law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for and dirigible to tie up or even approach the area.",0

Failing a test especially a driving test stinks. Your very excited to get it but then you dont. So the author is trying to show that despite the girls sadness she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. Also the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note you usually dont want to leave a story sad with no solution. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious.",0

"four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the Empire State Building. The first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the Empire State Building, a very different mast than the regular masts found in open field docking areas. When a dirigible would dock on the mast cause great stress to the building's frame, a problem that could be solved by increasing the strength of the steel frame. Another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers saw this would cause large problems over a densly populated area like, New York City. Once the mast was built a new problem arised, even if the dirigible could dock the intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently, or cause an airship to be unable to dock, like the inncodent with the Los Angeles. Nor could they use lead weights to weigh down the ballon since they would be a danger to civilians. Lastly, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. These reasons made it impossible for a ship to ever moor on top of the Empire state Building, although two ships got very close.",0
"On DATE1 my friend CAPS1 and I climbed on the bus headed for PERSON1 at CAPS2 CAPS3. CAPS1 and I were with our church group, and we were together till NUM1 am. We had been riding all diffrent rides all day and we got in line for the CAPS4. The sign out front said wait from this CAPS3 is NUM2 hours, but we were going to wait it out. I was around NUM3 then so that would put us on the ride around NUM4. We soon found out that PERSON1 also started a NUM5 p m and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around NUM6 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. About every five minutes we would hear loud obnixous screams, and we always heard mouths running like they were in a race. Then at about NUM4 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said CAPS5 go on the CAPS6 all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste a elephant ear on my tounge. Little did we know that we would have to walk through CAPS7. Caenevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day l learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did.",0
"I Believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are a relatively new invention, they have become very popular. Computers allo people to talk online with each other. They also allow students to complete homework assignments and important projects. Computers also allow people to store important files and pictures in places that won't get lost. Computers are helpful in so many ways, but these are just a few. Computers allow people online. whether CAPS3's through email, instant messaging, or a video chat, computers peplace old and haved ways ORGANIZATION1 communication. For example, instead ORGANIZATION1 writing a letter to someone, mailinbg CAPS3 to them, and having to wait two days for them to receive CAPS3, email them! Obtain an email address, type a message, and click send. They will receive the message instantly, and even reply soon enough PERSON1, president ORGANIZATION1 the ORGANIZATION1, says, ""Computers are an important part fo technology. People use them everyday."" CAPS1 them everyday doesn't mean just for fun. CAPS3 also helps with work. Three out ORGANIZATION1 four adults who used computers say that they help them with their work and social status. Computers are a part ORGANIZATION1 everyday life, and they can help with almost anything. Computers allow students to finish homework and projects quite fst. Instead ORGANIZATION1 hand-writing that four-page essay on PERSON2 CAPS1 textbooks and use the internet for finding information. Computers also allow students to email teachers in case ORGANIZATION1 missed classes and assignments. CAPS4 PERSON3, a student at ORGANIZATION2 who had missed quite a few days ORGANIZATION1 school, says, ""CAPS2 I had to do was email my teachers, and they sent me CAPS2 the homework assignment. I missed CAPS3 was that easy."" CAPS4's not the only one who agrees that computers are a big help. Millions ORGANIZATION1 kids & adults agree. Computers not only let students write reports; they also allows them to save them for future uses. They also save important files and precious pictures. Everyone hates CAPS3 when their camera or video camera breaks, and will their precious and wonderful memories are gone. Well, just save them to the computer, and they're there forever! NUM1 out ORGANIZATION1 NUM2 people who store CAPS2 their pictures in a computer agrees this is the best way to do CAPS3. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people. They allow people to talk online. do homework & projects, and store important files. I can assume that everyone agrees with me that computers are an important part ORGANIZATION1 everyday life.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main concern was the dirigibles themselves because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above a densely populated area it would be desasterous. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the building's mooring mast was nature. A mooring mast is used for docking airships such as a dirigible or a zeppelin. With these large air crafts, docking them on top of a building where winds are violently shifting is very dangerous. the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, posing as a CAPS1 threat. Dirigibles moored in open land feilds where they could be weighed down with lead weights. With a dirigible moored over the Empire State Building, it would dangle high above pedestrians, this is neither CAPS2 nor practicle. Constructing the Empire State Building had CAPS3 more challenges and obsticles than its architects would have hoped for.",0
"In my opinion i think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow you to communicate will people from anywhere in the world. You can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book. Also many more jobs want people with computer skills. It is also fun and educational. Can you imagine how much harder it would be to communicate with someone who lives in, lets say LOCATION1. It would be a lot harder, dont you think? Well thanks to computers it is as easy as turning on your computer. Many teachers enjoy doing activities with penpals. That would be a lot harder if you had to write letters. It would also cost a lot more money to call. Also, if you were looking for specific information about florida it is alot easier on a computer. You just type in what it is you are looking for, rather than reading through tons of books, in which case you might not even find what you are looking for. Also the computer has millions of iinformation. The computer also has various pictures which is also good. Another good reason is that many more jobs these days want to hire someone who knows how to work with computers. You can do a lot more things on a computer that you cant do on a piece of paper. For example make animated movies and video games. These things have evolved over the years thanks to computers. Finally my last reason, its not only educational its also fun. Sure you can research information and do you rhomework on the computer, but you can also play games. Computers can do all sorts of different things. Computers can be programed to have simulations for jobs like policemen ambulance drivers, and doctors. These are all things that save lives. That is why i think computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers our country probably wouldn't be as evolved as it is today.",0
"Offensive literature, sexual content, disagreeable topics. Books all have those things to someone some where. It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either.     Consorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and can not do. The same goes for being told what you can and can not read. No one wants the truth cut out of  their reading materials.      Censoring books could take away from learning. In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist.     The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That ammendment was created for a reason, to let CAPS1 speek their beliefs.     Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who MONTH1 be offended by whatever it is they are censoring. Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about. People need to be able to speek their minds and beliefs. But people also need to be able to have constructive critisism and be mature about offensive writing. Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read. It is just life",0

"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (NUM1) This shows that docking dirigibles can be harmful as some buildings and many people can be negatively affected. The large business district is too densely populated to allow such a thing. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (NUM2) This obstacle builders faced brought up that lives are yet again in danger, not to mention very expensive damage that allowing dirigibles can cause. Another obstacle builders faced was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

"The builders of the Empire State Building taste some obstacles in attempting to have a dirigible dock.  The dock would break the laws.  The dock would also be a danger to the people below.  It would also put a lot of stress to the frame of the building.""",0
"There were many problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as nature itself. At NUM1 ft. the winds were just too strong and unpredictable to get close to and dock a dirigible. On top of nature, laws prevented the landing. Airships could not fly low over urban areas so even attempting to approach the area would be illegal. This idea still posed a great deal of potential danger even if there were no laws against it and wind didn't exist. Many dirigibles were made using hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In such a highly populated area as New York City if one were to catch fire the damage would be horrifying. I hope Al Smith was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the title of world's tallest building because he didn't get his mast",0
"Maybe, to a sense I do not think that boo'ks should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is becasue that some books, magazine and other stuff can be informative. They can help you wtih certain questions. They MONTH1 not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have.      But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People MONTH1 take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other poeple. The sense of this nautre is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book.      If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives. They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to terach. They MONTH1 think they are doing t the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff. You MONTH1 not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming.      Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They MONTH1 not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have. Certain books MONTH1 stay on the shelf such as a CAPS1 book. CAPS1 books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body. So the CAPS1 books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings.     The CAPS1 magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the CAPS1 items. People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not. Not you would not becasue a CAPS1 book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you. That also could go for the sexual magaizes. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast. You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine. I know that CAPS1 books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults.     As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of CAPS2's or music but othe people do. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days.        If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves. People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others.      If you go back to the NUM1's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now.      Generations change and so does the enivorment but  you can not change they way we grew up. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough and they wont let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours.     Its not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another",0

"Today, wherever you go, there is technology being used. The most common, computers are widely used by a majority of people, but are computers really beneficial to society? Computers are beneficial to society because it is a way to connect with the world, a way to increase responsibility, and helpful for education. Computers are beneficial because they help people connect with the world. You can use a computer to find anything that is on the web, so you can find information about places that interest you or places that you would like to visit. According to the ORGANIZATION1, NUM1 out of NUM2 people check the internet for places to ORGANIZATION1 to before they actually go. CAPS1, it is a way to connect with faraway friends. One of my friends moved to LOCATION1 when we were in NUM3 grade, but we still e-mail each other, and are still friends. The computer is CAPS1 one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events. All you have to do is go to a news website. All of these connections will widen people's views of the world. Computers are a way to increase responsibility, too. When the people use the computer, there are many choices that they have to make, like what websites to go to and what to download or watch. Having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is. Even if you choose the wrong choice, you will learn from your mistake. Second, the computer is a very fragile machine and it takes a lot of to handle. For example, you can't have any liquid nearby and must not throw objects near or on the computer. Thinking of this and making sure not to damage the computer are ways to increase responsibility. Lastly, computers are beneficial because they help education. Teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting. For example, they can create points and presentation to providea CAPS1, students can on what they learned at school. CAPS1, you can make for the students, which provide them with their homework and information about the classes one of my friends once said ""CAPS2 the I would definitely be failing"". Nobody wants to talk and a great way to present this. Lastly, if you want information on a particular school, you can just search it online and find its website. School websites have information about classes, events, and clubs. They provide the information that you need to think about going to that school in an easy, convenient way, while finding the website for the school take no more than NUM2 minutes, actually going to that school for information can take more than just NUM2 minutes, and even hours. According to ORGANIZATION2, NUM1 out of NUM2 students choose what college to go to first by checking its website. The computer is an easy, convenient way to get information. Now, no one should be doubting the benefits of a computer. They are a connection to the world, like places, and people. They increase responsibility by giving you many choices. They help education by providing information about and for schools. This is why computers are beneficial to the society.",0
"The CAPS1-inspirational, CAPS2 CAPS3 of CAPS4 I CAPS5 the CAPS6 of CAPS7 -- PERSON1. What is CAPS13, exactly? Some might say, ""CAPS8, that's obvious. CAPS13's a sound, emitted from a person when they think something is funny!"" That's as good a response as any other, and certainly quite believable. But I believe laughter has a much deeper definition; a definition that can only be explained through a marginally-humorous, less-than-inspirational story about my experiences as a CAPS9-CAPS10-CAPS11 basketball player.  This year, as a high school sophomore, I decided to do something I'd never done before: go out for the basketball team. I was inspired by a longing to become more involved in the school district, and to be able to exercise throughout the rain-drenched winter months in which CAPS13 took place. Having only picked up a basketball in order to steer clear of the ""sit-outs"" zone in middle school LOCATION1, my performance at early practices was comparable to that of a high school dropout determining the orbit of the planets around the sun; and at least they get a calculator. Naturally the year I decided to give basketball a shot, the coaches informed us that seven unlucky individuals would be plucked from the team with joyous abandon. Through sheer force of determination, I improved enough in our first few weeks to be deemed ""better than dirt"" by the coaches; narrowly avoiding losing my spot on the team. In the months ahead, I would learn that my job wouldn't be making baskets and stealing balls... As astonishing as CAPS13 was, my ability to imagine myself playing basketball far surpassed my actual skills on the court. I soon found that my place on the team wouldn't be aggressively running up and down the court fighting for control of an orange ball; I would be on the sidelines, cheeks firmly planted on the bench upon which my teammates would take breathers before going back into the action.  Our team could play basketball, but not often on the same level as the teams we faced. As each game came and went, I could see the fighting spirit fizzling out of my peers' eyes; their morale was simply dropping, and no amount of my ball-playing abilities could change that.  CAPS13 was one game in particular twhen I discovered I didn't have to play in order to help my team. CAPS13 was a home game, in our lower gym; we were down by about NUM1 points against a team we had fared CAPS8 against previously. Needless to say, players were becoming very frustrated. One of our star players, PERSON2, was becoming so frustrated that our coaches decided to pull him out for a breather. He was raging, spitting profanities. He dropped himself on the bench with the elegance of an enraged walrus. His mom came down from the stands to give him water, which only made him embarrassed him more. Sitting beside PERSON2, I could feel the anger radiating off of him. He was ranting under his breath over number NUM2, the opposing team's point guard. I noticed that while NUM2's fast legs and swift hands made him a great ball-player, his voice -- a good octave above his teammates' -- was much more CAPS8 suited for covering ORGANIZATION1 songs than calling out plays. I turned towards PERSON2, tapping him on the shoulder, and informed him of my insight. He looked at me for a moment, a mixture of anguish and ""don't-talk-to-me-or-I-will-murder-CAPS12"" on his face before bursting out laughing. Clapping me on the back, he said with a smile: ""CAPS12 always know CAPS4 to make us laugh, PERSON1"". Suddenly CAPS13 dawned on me that my banter and dripping sarcasm was quite often the one thing keeping smiles on my teammates' faces. I was able to use CAPS7 to diffuse tense situations, and allow emotions to flow freely in a more positive manner. We lost the game. In fact, we lost all but one game the entire season; and so I made CAPS13 my personal duty to keep the entire team in good spirits even in the worst of times. As the weeks went by, I started to feel more and more an integral part of the team; making teammates laugh kept their minds clear of anger and frustration, and allowed them to play to the best of their abilities.  And so CAPS13 was. Some players had quick hands, others had a flawless shot. Me? I made people laugh. I gave my peers, my friends, the ability to see light in even the most dire of situations. I didn't receive an award, a recognition of athletic ability. Instead I found the satisfaction of making people smile, of watching the enraged despair on their faces disappear -- replaced with optimism and hope. Laughter is what pushed my teammates past anger, to be the best they could be. So, CAPS12 tell me: Is laughter simply noise that a person makes when something is funny, or is CAPS13 something more?  Spoiler alert: CAPS13's much, much more.",0
"The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memoir is a very good and bright.

I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of CAPS2.  My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet.

In order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph NUM1) to the structure of the building. Also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building is a dock unrealistic.",0
"The author creates many different moods throughout the memoir. In the beginning, the author talks about his traditional Cuban home, in which he feels extremely comfortable and safe. Here, he creates a mood of warmth, and a very family oriented upbringing, all positively. Around paragraph NUM1, the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family. For example, (paragraph NUM1, final sentence) ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them. (his parents) to endure these hard times."" This gives a mood of pride and great triumph. That is the mood that PERSON1 gives in the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives.""",0
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saengs mother says, Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus, I think Saengs mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if shes saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isnt going to give up and shell keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows its hard to adjust to changes to lifes but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, shell be able to get situated in this new place.",0
"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. While building, Architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation. About over MONEY1 of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was to much. Last but not least there was a line New York against airships flying to low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State building. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd.",0
"The mood created by the author was great. He made it so Narciso was very happy, and proud to of grown up in Cuba. He also made it so Narciso was grateful for everything. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful). The mood created by the author was a great mood.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although the builders thought it to be a brilliant idea, they did not carefully consider the safety hazards they may have encountered, and how unrealistic the idea truly was. One of the greatest reasons the mooring mast was destined to be unable to fulfill its purpose was because of safety concerns. In paragraph NUM1 it states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When a dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse an accident like that would be if it occurred over a place as densely populated as downtown New York. Another very practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was, as stated in paragraph NUM2, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the area, let alone be able to tie up to the building. It is very apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many issues in the attempt.",0
"There were many problems to over come in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The first problem to over come was the stress a thousand foot long dirigible would add to the buildings frame. This was solved by spending over MONEY1 in modifying the building's frame work. Another problem was a law against airships flying too low around urban environments, brought up in paragraph NUM1. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" CAPS1 is writing about the wind. At 1,250 feet high the wind is violent, and would swing a dirigible around to much to be safe, and ends could not be weighed down for fear of injuring a pedestrian. Those were three signifigant reasons the mooring mast failed.",0

Computers alow me to learn about new NUM1, learning about cultures all over the world can be done by computers. The last way computers CAPS2 learning is by informing us about everyday thing like to get a stain out, how to pronounce a word, how to make a new dish, and much more. Computers are also crucial to communictaion. We use computers to talk to our freinds on facebook. You can also meet new people useing a pc. Everyone uses computer so you can basicly meet enyone. The last reason computers are important is for the commercial stand point computer help alot of small bussness out by letting than be known.

"I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and wont give up. Saeng  vowed silently to herself, I will take that test again, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.",0
The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomforalable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop. This shows that even though things can remind her of home it isnt the same. You have to get used to and become accostumed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test.,0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because when the hibiscus started budding it will give her inspiration to try and past the test again. In order to past the test she wanted to feel like she was home, And to have memories of her home to incourage her to try again. Therefore, this is the reason the author concludes the story with the last paragraph.",0
"Throughout the passage, the builders were faced with many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Al Smith had the idea to have dirigibles be a new form of transportation. The idea sounded great with the dirigibles moving at a rate of seventy five miles per hour and moving thousands of feet without needing to be refuled. Anxious, Al smith was very unsure of when the would all be done, saying, ""it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" It would just not be possible for the architect to drop the huge mooring mass on top of the buildings flat roof. Another problem would be the violent wind currents. The fate of the dirigible had faded out. Airplanes became more suitable to passengers then dirigibles.",0
"The CAPS1 had many obstacles Building the Empire State Building and also allowing Dirigibles to CAPS2 there. one of the obstacles was the expanded use in New York City. As said on page NUM1 paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the Lack of a suitable Landing Area"". Another obstacle was use of mooring mast was Nature itself. Also said on pg NUM2 paragraph NUM3. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself"". The CAPS3 Obstacle was weather for an example On page NUM4 paragraph NUM5 ""The ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast But could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" CAPS4 are NUM2 concluding examples of obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to CAPS2 near Empire State Building.",0
"To have a building built Over NUM1 ft. tall and expect dirigiblesblimbs be able to dock there is dangerous and has many obstacles around it. First, the weather is not always nice. If you have a windy day the blimb is going to sway back and forth over thousands of pedestrians in New York. Putting lead blocks in the back would be very dangerous. you have lead in the back swaying with thousands of people underneath you. Secondly, most blimbs outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammabe, and could destroy a whole building if the fire spread... Finally, blimbs could not moor at the Empire State building if it is against the law for an airship to hover to low to urban areas. Those are many reasons why blimps could not moor at the Empire State building.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow  dirigibles to dock there. The unforeseen safety issues lead to the downfall of the creative use for the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (CAPS1). They saw some of the dangerous affect of hydrogen when the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (CAPS1). Other problems that the builders of the building faced were those of mother nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (CAPS1). This made it hard for the dirigible to dock to the mast safely. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (CAPS1). Not only was nature playing against the builders, but the law was also. This is almost negligence on the builders part to not realize that they would be breaking a law by constructing this mooring mast. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (CAPS1). Although the idea for a dirigible mooring mast on top of the empire State building seemed innovative and practical, it was irrelevant due to the many obstacles that obstructed the builders of the Empire State Building.",0

"I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc..., because people should have the right to read anything that want.      People do not necessairly like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources availablet to them. Take the book, CAPS1 in the CAPS2, for example. In that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls. Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though noone would really want to read about that.      Some people have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next. Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them.              Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. Who can say where it should stop? Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be un-effected by it. Just imagine watching CAPS3 and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. It would really offend people, while othre people couldn't care less.      Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it",0
"In Winter Hibiscus, by minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is buddling , then I will take the test again, CAPS1 author concludes the story in this way because it is somewhat of a cliffhanger. In the story, CAPS2 is upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the united states and so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up ??? reminding being alike the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasnt given up and that she is going  to try and pass the drivers license test again. But what you dont know is the end result of whether she passes or not and so it is a cliffhaofer. That is why the author ended the story in this way.",0
"give people the abilit to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk onlone with other people, and computers help to make better technology. I belive that computers have positive effect on people. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the abilit to learn about faraway places. NUM1 out of NUM2 students use the computers to do homework. I was visiting a prompt last week. I ddn't know alot abou LOCATION1 so I whent on the computers and you know what i got to know more about LOCATION1 and things to the computers I got a A+. So the computers have a positive effect on people. The next reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers allow people to talk online with other poeple. Say if a man whant to a and he left his phone at home how will he take to his family why he had computers he can talk to his family online. My family is back in LOCATION1 I haven't see them in four years so I whant to the stor and get a wedcan and i get to see my family afdter four years. So computers do have a positive effect on people. My last reason why computers have a benefits in society is because computers help to make better technology. Computers help people to make better car, light, an so on. Without computers society is because computers help the soldiers to win wars and even help people to live. My father was dying without computer my father would die thang to computer I have father today. In the end computer have the benefits in society the three reason is computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway place, and computers allow people to talk online with other people and computers help people to make better technology. Spending time enjoying nature is good computers have benfits society better. I hope my three reason can persuade the local news paper to agree with my position that computer have a positive effect on people.",0

"In the excerpt from, ""The CAPS1 Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it was mentioned that architects faced challenges when attempting when allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building One obstical they faced was the fact that they used hydrogen instead of helium.

The main problem they faced was the nature itall. It said ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" The dirigible has the potential to swivle around the mast and with all the pedestrians below that is very dangerous.

"Books are gateways to other worlds.  Today there are books on almost any topic anybody could dream of.  People use books to forget their troubles and take a trip to somewhere outside of themselves.  Now the content of some books are not always appropriate.  Schools try to provide books that appeal to all audiences, but that ability is being impaired by books being banned from shelves.  Students then can't read a book simply because someone else didn't appprove of the content.  That is unfair and should be stopped.  Students should have the right to make choose what they want to read, yet some people want to take that right away from students.  Students, are also able to make choices on what's appropriate for them to read.  If lawmakers give in to the complaints of a few people it could hinder a students rights and make students believe that they are not trusted.     The content of what goes into a book is up to the author.  The books someone decides to read is up to that particular reader.  Sometimes authors go into extensive detail to get their point across or have a book with very mature content in them.  Now some people think that because a book is inappropriate in their views then it shouldn't be avalivable to read at all.  This is unfair not only to any potiental reader of that book, but also the author who worked hard to write that book.  Students are smarter than many people give them credit for.  They know what they should and shouldn't be reading, but if the choice of what they read is left up to other people they feel betrayed and untrusted.      Students have as many rights as people who don't go to school.  If books are being taken of shelves based on a few people opinions then their rights are being infringed upon by the people who deemed it inappropriate.  Now the students freedom to choose what they want to read is gone, and all that remains is books choosen worthy by other people.  Rights are something guarenteed to students as the enter school, buty now rights are slowly being taken away from students.  The right to choose what book they read is one that should not be taken.  As author Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf, that work that i abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  If one person says they think a book should be taken away, then another person wants another book taken away, until the point where no books are left then how will students ever get to read?     Books are essential to a students growth into adulthood.  If people gain the right to take books off shelves then music, movies, magazines will all get taken off shelves too.  Books are for any reader that decides they want to go to that world.  Students have the right to choose what books they read, as well as the ability to know what they should read.  Books should remain where they belong, in schools on the shelves.",0

For example Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride.",0
"As a small child I remember my mom reading me stories to put my to sleep. There was always one book that I remember the most named, 'A light in the CAPS1' by PERSON1. As i was walking into my public library the other day i was looking at the books that had been cenored because it encouraged, the following; mistreating parents, offensive language, bad habits, and other things. I was mad that this book had, essentally, been erased from all of children literature just because a few people CAPS2 that it gives a bad message. Think about it though, when you are a child either having a book read to you, or reading one yourself do you honestly pay attention to such small details?    I do not think that books and music should not be censored, because society does a good job of thinking and figuring out what is acceptable and what is not. I understand the idea of warning labels, but i feel that censorship is too far. In the example I used in the paragraph above, that actually happened to me. So, i do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate. Even when i read that book today i do not see any of the reasons that were listed in the book. Therefor beleive that it was unjustly censored, meaning that a really good book will never reach the eyes and ears of child that deserve to hear and read it.     Over the years many things have been censored, some had an actual reason, others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they read the book. the point is, is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe, they should just give an idea saying that there is potentailly inapprapriate materail in that certain book and should not be read to or by a certain age group. when you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been cesored for reasons that make no sense? That is the primary reason why I believe there should not be any censorship",0

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph ""When they come back, then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes. After moving Saeng feels alone and wants to go back home but she feels in her heart that she can try given time. The hibiscus remines Saeng of the flower back in her home country this helps her see that she has to let go of her past and live in the now.",0
"What is this world coming to?  We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out. Being a daughter and teenager myself, I personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines.  The sex, drugs, and violence used to create a story, have destroyed the minds of our youth.  I strongly feel this disturing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries.          I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read.  I agree reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling, but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking.  The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious they become.  I feel they will eventually let curiousity get the better of them.      Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all apart of growing up, but I disagree.  Trying any one of these harmful activites portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe danger.  It only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs.         To better prove my point, think of your favorite book.  Did you look up to any of the main characters? Did you want to be just like himher?  Well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model.  They MONTH1 save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well.  This tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite.     I stand by my opinion and believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries.  This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth.  It leads them to believe everyone, including their heros in books and movies, does these things.  Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for",0
"CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but disagree with the article, PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they premote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are NUM1 dropped almost PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand-eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teaching people how to clothings are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand-eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people.",0

"The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.",0
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders found many obstacles on the way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building Some of those obstacles were as follow. The main concern was the safety of the passenger boarding and unboarding as well as the people below The concern for the people below was how the dirigible sometimes was floating with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. So they didn't want chances of the dirigible blowing up. Another main concern was there was an ""exsiting law over airships flying to low over urban areas"" (par NUM1) The dirigible floated with the air and being as long as NUM2 ft. the back of the dirigible where it wasn't securely fastened would circle around the mooring from the high wind currents. The winds were shifting all the time so it was a very big safety issue. Another obstacle was the dirigible docking, was mainly put into place because of jealousy. The man was jealous because his competition Al Smith was catching up with him before the idea of dirigible came to mind.",0
"Through most the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune summer time rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst. So he stuck some pepples in his mouth to take his mind off it. Then he thought about how lucky hed be if he checked, CAPS1 negative to me.",0
"ORGANIZATION1, PERCENT1 of the world say that computers are a good way to interact with people, learn about forgien people and places and also learn about where your family came from. So here I am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society. How do you meet people from different countries? One way is interacting with different people all over the world. I am saying this because the internet has a lot of benifits in meeting people. One way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account. Another way is go on a website where you can pen-pal someone from a different place in the world. The final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world. Do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer? Well you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person. I am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school. Computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework. I am saying this because with nobody home when nobody there when you come home from school who is going to help you with your homework you can use a website that helps you understand the material better. Do you know where your family comes from? A way you can find out with your family come from is use a website to find where your family comes from. For example, LOCATION1 is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life, were they fight in a war. You can find this all out on the computer. Another way is you can ask your parents the name of someone and type there name in google.com. There are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some, interact with people, learn about other places and learn about family. I hope you understand this better.",0
"Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. PERSON2, PERSON3, ORGANIZATION2, and CAPS1. CAPS1's real name is PERSON1 but we all call her CAPS1 because how she acts. PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation MONTH1 be. I remember when PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The TIME1 before it had been ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks PERSON2's CAPS3 had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her CAPS3, broke the news to her DATE1 TIME1 after we left for ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. PERSON2 and her CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her CAPS3's mind. I invited PERSON2 over for the TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong.",0
"The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around.

"I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor cetian works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imanenge how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was distroyed.     Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being distroyed without any thought to others? I can and I feel horible just thinking about it so I belive that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the disicion if their work should be saved or distroyed.     With these reasons that I have shaired with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a childs dreams think about how thet would feel if anything of theirs was distroyed.",0

"I believe that the books, music, movies, magazines should be removed if they are really offensive. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean that it would be to another person. Any movie you watch could be offensive to one person or two but, not everyone. So I would say no to taking the offensive things off the shelfs because, who is really going to be offened by and are they really offened by this matter or aspect.      Also, I believe that some people might lie about if they are offened by it just so that they will take it off the self. Maybe, there is a movie for example, that there is a lot of bad words, I could see them being able to take that off the self because, a lot of people don't like those words to be used and thats understandable. If they are just taking it off the self tho for one little thing I don't think that should be aloud.     I think that if that person is getting offened by what a book said or a movie said then don't read it or don't watch it. No body is forcing you to watch or read a book that you don't want to. Reading and watching a certain movie is all up to you not what others say.      I believe that this really has to go down to what the persons beliefs are. Maybe they go to church every day which means that they probably aren't going to be watching the movie ' CAPS1 CAPS2.'  They are going to pick a movie more suitiable to their life style and what their use to. Maybe they had a friend that suggested that they should watch a movie and they did, they might have taking offensivness to that, but that was also there choice they didn't have to watch it.      If this was the case to take a book, movie, music out because someone was offened then there would be nothing left. Are you saying that you would listen to everyone if they came in to get a book and then came back and said ' this book offened me, I want you to take it off the self.' I'm sorry but, I'm having a hard time believing that your going to listen to every single person that comes in a says that. Also, CAPS3 do you know it was offensive to them are you going to have them show you what was the problem with this book? My guess is no because you don't want to deal with that many people about one or two maybe even five books.     I'm not saying that people don't get offened by somethings that books and movies say but, your going to have a lot more then just one person come in and say that there are more then just one book or movie. so then there would be no books left. What if you have someone come in and they request that they have a certain movie and you say ' CAPS4, I'm sorry we had to take that movie off the self because, it offened someone.' I have a feeling that person is not going to be happy and you will have some explaining to do.     Also, what if a person comes in and asks for something and you tell them that you had to take it down and they say that it was a very nice movie are you going to listen to them also if you listen to one person don't you think that its fair if you listen to the other person also that likes the movie. I am a person that believes theres two parts to every story. So, therefore, I think that you should listen to both sides or keep what you have if that person wants to take it off the self then do it but, if someone asks for that specific one then I would let them have it because that isn't going to hurt the person that got offened by the book or movie is it.     Therefore, I think that they should keep the books, movies and music all on the seleves unless more then one person complains then it would be a different story.",0

"The mood of the story is happy. Everyone spend time with their family, having fun together, celebrating together would give you a happy feeling of what a family is. It's like how the family in the story moved to the United States, they first doesn't know anyone, they haver no friends. They are living in an apartment that has one room, but years later, they moved to a NUM1-room apartment. There live a family with a borned baby above them. the baby is the job for the main character (baby sitter) and also the main character's first friend.

"Experts say, ""PERCENT1 of CAPS3 spend NUM1 hours or more on the computer daily"" The reccomened time limits is NUM2 hour. By spending more time on computers people aren't exercising. Secondly, those people aren't enjoying life and nature. Lastly, the use of computer puts a strains on social skills between friends and family. Surely the effects of computers cant be good. First off, people in this aren't exercising as much as they should. Obesity and diabetes effects <PERCENT1NUM3> of CAPS4. Both of these diseases are lethal. If you spend so many hours on the computer these diseases wouldn't spread nearby as fast. When will you get off the computer for an hour and go outside or to the gym and exercuse so these won't affect you? Secondly, nature is a marvelous thing. Sure camping in a tent and catching dinner isn't for everyone. But, there are many ways to experience nature without ""roughing it."" You can go to the or to the aquarium. Sit on your back pond and go bird watching. All of these are great alternatives to sitting at the computer screen, looking at pictures of nature. Lastly, people aren't spending enough time with family and friends. Yes you can email, I. M., CAPS5, and CAPS6 family and friends, but its not the as people are less and friendly then they. Mainly of socia skills. We need to the of social without computer. In conclusion, computer do have a negative affect on people in the long tern. People aren't exersising. They aren't enjoying nature. Finally their bonds between friends and family are weahiming. This is a growing problem which must be put to end. Thank you for your time.",0
"Many things such as books, music, magazines, ect., causes problem acts for children to act different, but i say that everything should stay in the library because there more things that causes acts than the things that are listed. Many children get their acts from books, movies, and magazines but most get their acts from something different.   Children gets most of their acts from the television that their viewing at home wich causes them to think if their parents doesn't care about what their watching than it's okay to view what ever.So the most that is causing acts is what is being viewed at homes or in the movies. So I really say that it's okay for children to read or watch what evers legal on television.   But to me in the the libraries it's up to whoms ever controling it should decide by ages. just like legal things only legal for adults. I say that it's only for adults because childern starts argument from what ever they see expecially when their around their friends. When children is around their friends they feel that it's cool to do what ever. And it's all coming from thing based on violence in the books that children reads more often. So to me I will say that it shouldnt be okay for what is being viewed.",0
"Based on excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were, to get it to work. For many reasons the builders would never get dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.One reason this idea could never happen was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas most places used to fuel there dirigibles made them highly flammable. In a highly populated areas such as New York this would be a problem.Another issue would be money. The builders would need more money to strengthen the building for the weight of the dirigibles. With a one thousand foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether there will be a lot of stress on the building.Finally the last reason would be safety. Violent winds would make dirigibles unstable When docked to the building.

"Is it offensive?          Should people have the right to take down other people ideas? What do you think; I think so ? for centuries people have been writing,making video,and, all types of music. Some consider it a freedom of speech. Others might think of it as being rebellious or conspiracy.     I believe CAPS1 are exceptional writers and promising producers  and artists. But not all medias are good. Over a vast amount of time young children have been influenced by medias such as:books,movies,music,etc...Its perfectly normal for many adults who have children to discriminate against certain media .But thats not all CAPS1 are more cases than just children that are suffering theres also religon, race, gender, sexuality, and social groups.          CAPS1 should be a certain rules and certains laws that are against such wrong doings.But everyone is entiltled to CAPS1 opinion.Hundreds of people are discreminated because of what they here and see in the medias.A life changing expierience for me was the movie The CAPS2 CAPS3. This could be considered offensive to lots of peolpe such as those of the african american decent or any other race that has suffered similar abuse.          This is just a few issues with freedom of speech ,but CAPS1 will always be disagreements and differennt views of oppinion.But I for one believe that theres just certain stuff that shoukdnt be allowed to be put out in to public media",0
"CAPS1 you love computers but fear that you or loved ones spend way to much time on them? If so, then maybe we should CAPS1 something. Toomany people have issues with their vision due to starring at computers to long. Also, people miss out on other outdoor activities as well. Finally, if people are working off of computers for their job then there missing out on same of the other important things in life such as, interacting with family and friends, enjoying the outdoors, or just simply spending time with their close ones. Now, are you for or against this descison of people getting ""hooked"" on computers? In my opinion people should be enjoying things and not spend most of their time on computers. Since people are so dependent on computers, sometimes working form one can hurt your vision. The bright white computer screen filled with all those e-mails can really affect your vision. I know my dad always gets headaches and his vision isn't the best thing when it comes to him working on a computer all day. Being indoors and on a computer all day long makes you really miss the outdoor activites that their are. Things such as sports, nature, riding a bike and many other activities are missed out because of being on a computer all day. Only fun and energized people get out and get active. Last but not least, CAPS1 you enjoy spending time with the ones you love but seem to busy because your on the computer all day? If so then get up and go have fun! Take the wife and kids on a hike or go and ride a bike, its awesome excersise for you, family and friends and its actually fun! So, its now or never. CAPS1 you want to be at home on a computer all day or CAPS1 you want to be high energized and spending quality time with family and friends? Most impotantly CAPS1 you want to be energized and healthy with no vision problems and stop those awful headaches? Well, without a if you get up and get active it will be the best decision you will make! So, get up, grab the kids and get going on your new and energized, pain free life.",0
My at saying your patient is. Your patient when you wait in line for something is being patient. Waiting your turn is being patience one time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play but I didn`t get to play until the fourth queiter with NUM1 to go but you know what I did had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient when they were little they never act like that.,0
"There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says a blossom of two would have blown into the well It reminds her of her homeland. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she saidshe realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now. This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing.",0
I believe that going on the computer has a positive effect on people. It is also true that some people are not getting enough exercise. To prevent not getting enough exercise we should play sports or have family activities to atleast get out of our house. Everybody needs to stop being lazy and get active. I think that an excerise day should be mode and turned into a tradition. It could be twice a year or more a month or whatever is picked as long as there is one day LOCATION2 or even more than LOCATION2 can exercise on.,0
"CAPS1   the  story  the  condition of  problem  often effected the mood of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said ,â Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.â CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist.",0
"Everything in the story is about to change. The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well, Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew. That is what Saeng must do she must mature and grow in this new country. For example Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window then in did in her home country. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already and putting it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have.",0
"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding; then I will take that test again. The author concludes this story Winter Hibiscus with this paragraph because in the story it's about Saeng and she fails her drivers test, and notice a familiar plant which causes her to go to a florist shop. As Saeng learns about this familian plant it encourages her to retake that drivers test, to where as though the snow is gone and the sun is shining.	1	1		1																					10535	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       	0	0		0																					10536	4	The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a lot of home sickness, missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Saeng is uncomfortable living in LOCATION1 and wishes to go back to Vietnam. Butt by the end, Saengs attitude changes from despair to hope. Even though she has failed her drivers test. Saeng is determined and hopeful to do at least something in this new country by saying """"...then I will take the test again. Saeng has changed a good deal within this story and that change in attitude is seen with the exerpt on geese in the last paragraph.""",0
The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships can fly to low over urban areas. Because of these reasons it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe.,0
"There are many books, movies, and magazines on shelves that can offence people in many ways. These can be books of war, slavery, and even religion that could aggrevate people and make them feel the need for them to remove those books from the libraries without hesitation.      There are indeed many books out there that could offence people and could be discriminating, but should those books really be taken out? I believe that books were made for a purpose. Each book and even magazine has a fact of information regarding what is either happening in the world or what could happen. Even for the books that are unrealistic they are also made for a reason and should be allowed to have their place in the library.      The library has over thousands of books and movies to choose from. If there even was one book that someone found discriminating or offensive they could always just pass by it and choose one that suits what they want. I feel that it is the person's choice of what they want to read or watch not the books or movies fault.     The books and movies are also split into genres into which each movie and book belongs in. So if you don't specifically want to see something than you can just skip the section the movies or books are in that you find discriminating and go to the ones that you feel okay with.      There are also many books and movies out there that might seem discriminating but they could actually teach you about life and what could happend and how to solve these problems. One example is when I was child growing up I was reading about this girl getting into a car accident and loosing everything just because she was drunk while she was driving. My mother didn't want me reading the book, but it actually helped me alot because it taught me the valuable lesson of never drinking and driving, because of reading that book at such a young age and implanting the story in my head I know that I will never in my life do what that girl did to herself.      This shows that even if a book might seem discriminating and wrong it can still teach people life lessons and danger that they probably wouldn't know about unless they read that book or watched that movie.      I feel that even if we removed the offensive magazines, books, and movies that don't have any potential what so ever, people would still find a way to get what they were looking for, even if it is from the library or not. There are many people that are wrong in this world and banning certain books from the library probably wouldn't stop them from doing what they want to do.      Music is another thing that shouldn't be that troubled about. Some people listen to certain types of music to calm their nerves down. One example is the CAPS1 rapper ORGANIZATION1. His songs consist of severe sadness and frequent cussing, but in his songs are messages that can relate to other people and listening to that certain song might stop them from doing illegal things or even commiting suicide. The songs can symbolize their lives and make them know that they are not the only ones living that way and that they aren't always alone in what they do.      I feel that each book, movie, and magazine has at least one thing that a person can find offensive. If we start removing each one that someone finds offencive than there probably wouldn't be a single book left on the library shelves.      The books we read, the magazines we glance at, and the movies we watch will probably have something offensive in them but I do not think that they should be censored or removed becasue there is always a chance that those books, movies, or magazines could help you out later in life",0
"The obstacles of the builders of the Empire State Building faced were hard because they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building do to the frame work Also the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would also have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. And over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications have to be made to the building's framework The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from sides, with a steps-back design that imitated over all shape of the building itself capital rocket-shape mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny-aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm.",0
"Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of CAPS27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. CAPS27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. CAPS4 had medicine CAPS2 all CAPS34 I think the best CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search.  It was DATE1 TIME1. Every DATE1 CAPS27 step dad's kids come over for dinner. CAPS27 mom wasn't really feeling well so CAPS4 went upstairs CAPS2 started on her big book of word-searches. CAPS27 step-sister had recently gotten a new car so CAPS4 CAPS2 CAPS27 step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for CAPS19 two minutes then came back inside. CAPS27 step-brother was on CAPS27 step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on CAPS22 CAPS2 we started playing. A few minutes later PERSON2, CAPS27 step dad, said that he was going to ORGANIZATION1. Katie, CAPS27 step-sister, CAPS2 PERSON1, CAPS27 step-brother, decided to CAPS46 with them. PERSON2 went upstairs to ask CAPS27 mom if CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left CAPS2 I went upstairs to check on her. I saw CAPS4 was going her word-search CAPS2 I started to help her.  I don't remember the name of the word-search CAPS34 we did several. Since CAPS4 had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it CAPS2 CAPS27 mom said, ""CAPS1 me?"" CAPS2 I started laughing. I repeated myself CAPS2 we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search CAPS2 started a new one. This one was called ""CAPS3."" CAPS4 took the book CAPS2 looked over the list CAPS2 suddenly said ""CAPS5-winks! Yeah!"" CAPS2 I looked at her like CAPS4 was crazy. Which CAPS4 was. I looked at the list again CAPS2 I start laughing really hard CAPS2 ask, ""CAPS7's CAPS8?"" I was saying it wrong CAPS34 when CAPS24 were laughing that hard, who wouldn't?  ""CAPS7?"" CAPS4 asked CAPS2 I showed it to her. ""CAPS11 CAPS12 CAPS13."" CAPS4 said CAPS2 we started laughing. ""That sounds like something the CAPS15 CAPS16 would say."" I comment CAPS2 CAPS27 mom does the little song from the CAPS15 CAPS16 song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. CAPS34 we did. The next one I think was called ""CAPS19 CAPS20 CAPS21"" CAPS22 were several things on CAPS22 we didn't know. I asked her CAPS7 one was CAPS2 CAPS4's like, ""I don't know."" CAPS2 then I asked her another. ""CAPS24're asking me all the things I don't know."" CAPS4 said. This word search was kind of funny CAPS34 only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word ""ear"" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. CAPS34 ""earring"" was. We ended up finding ""hair"" at the end of the ""ear"" I'd circled. ""CAPS26 thanks for that picture."" CAPS27 mom said. ""CAPS7? Ear-hair?"" I asked CAPS2 we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto ""CAPS29"". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was ""CAPS30"" CAPS2 I laughed CAPS2 said ""CAPS26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a CAPS30 on their head. 'CAPS32, nice CAPS30.'"" I said in a weird voice. ""'CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the CAPS30 store.'"" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because CAPS27 mom was laughing really really hard.  ""CAPS34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a CAPS30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of CAPS20 head."" I said before laughing again. Katie CAPS2 PERSON1 walked in the room CAPS2 looked at us like 'CAPS7 the heck?' CAPS2 I showed her the word-search. ""CAPS26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy."" CAPS4 said, laughing as well. CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. ""CAPS39, CAPS39, it's things that wear hats."" CAPS4 managed to get out CAPS2 I'm looking at her. ""CAPS7 kind of a hat does a CAPS30 wear?"" I asked, smirking. CAPS4 shook her head. ""I don't know."" CAPS4 said like CAPS4 was giving up. Katie CAPS2 PERSON1 then said good-bye CAPS2 left. ""CAPS43, CAPS39 more. I need to take CAPS27 pills."" I snorted at CAPS7 CAPS4 said. ""CAPS39, CAPS24 really don't need any pills."" CAPS4 looks at me like CAPS4 was going to punch me. CAPS4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. ""CAPS46 away."" CAPS4 said with a smile. ""CAPS48."" I said before turning CAPS2 walking back to CAPS27 room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that CAPS24 kind of had to be CAPS22 to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its CAPS49.",0
"She ends with that paragraph because it starts over. When the geese came back and the hibiscus is budding its like restart and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country. I think she will be able deal with it better and take it again, it shows that she wont give up.",0
"Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for rough road ahead, CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in CAPS2 civilization after he found NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.",0
"I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, its strong enough to make it through the cold months here CAPS1 its telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again.",0
"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill... This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip.",0
I think the mood was happy CAPS2 the CAPS1 talk about a PERSON2 named narciso Rodriguez and that he lived in Cuba and he's parents moved to the United States so the family could Be together and I think that the CAPS1's mood is happy CAPS2 this story was great a talk about a CAPS3 and his parents moving to the United States.,0
"At the end of the essay Winter Hibiscus by CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive manner. When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there, was to show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country that she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test. Thats why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.",0
"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to led comfortable when she saw the geese and plants the hibiscus in the winter and keeps it from dying. In the story it said,""... their faint banks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now"". I think this is explaining how she feels after seeing the geese fly over head because she uses to see that in Vietnam. Also, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, she gains more confidence because she leds like shes back in Vietnam. All in all, that's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.",0
"I think that all books, music,movies,magazines, and anything thats offensive should be took off shelves because CAPS1 are lil kids that read books and they dont need to hear or reed offensive things. But at the same time for the peope that do wanna hear or reed things like that then their should be a area in the librarie for materials like that.                    CAPS1 are all kinds of libraries that have offensive books,movies,magazines other reasons they should take offensive materials off the shelves because it could be racist or just offening certin things and people don't wanna see or reed about white people hating black people or black people hating white people or any type of racist things. It shouldnt be alounded because it can hurt someones feelings.                  I have my own observations with reading some books from my school librarie and have came acrossed some words that was offensive. like in some books they use the word nigger and since im black it's offensive to me i know that they are not saying it to me but they still say it and it kinda touches me in a way. Im not sayin that it is offensive towards all people but it is me so the way they could is like i said instead of having offensive books out on shelves they should have one area where materials like that could be found in stead of having the material where childeren  and other people will get offened.           The last thing i wanna talk about is that for childeren and other people they dont wanna see nasty things that are in books if i had a kid i wouldnt want my childeren too c nasty things that could be offensive to. CAPS1 books also that talk about drugs and people dont wanna hear or read about that it. but CAPS1 are some people also that do wanna see or read about things like that like older people they have diffent point of views about things so thats why again CAPS1 should be one area in libraries for materials like that.     In conclustion i think that CAPS1 should hear me out and take in what i have to say because the material thats are in books,music, or magazines can be offensive to anybody any race could be offened by what they see or read so again CAPS1 should be a place in libraries for that",0

"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesnt have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. This statement proves that the cyclist wasnt a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you MONTH1 start to see things that arent there, but you want to see those things.  I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnt a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. It was a good decision that the cyclist didnt get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful.",0

"If everyone in the world could permantly take a book, movie,music, etc., off the shelf because they think it is offensive would there be any of those thing left for us to enjoy?      I personally think that if people could do that they would, but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you? No, it might not be, so does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanatly so no one else can read it? I think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of there own opinion of it.     If anyone could do that would there ever be uniqueness in people? I dont think there would be. Just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same. Thus it shouldnt be taken away from that person if heshe enjoys listening to it.     On the other hand I understand that some people might listen to music or read books that has offensive language and that they would not want there children hearing or reading that but that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf. Ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language what should we do then? You can just take that person out of the world.     So I guess the point im trying to get across is that just because you think its offensive and dont like it doesnt mean everyone in the world thinks that. To end my acticle I want you to think about whats offensive to you MONTH1 not bee the same for others.",0
"Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on CAPS1 shelves.  They claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read.  These books are known as 'CAPS2 Books.'  CAPS3, librarians, and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not.     In the novel To CAPS4 a CAPS5, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive.  These words, however, are essential to the setting of the novel.  The author is not claiming that she personally feels that CAPS6 CAPS7 should be described in the way that they are, but a racist individual, such as PERSON3 or many people during the time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a way.  The novel, To CAPS4 a CAPS9, is a great way for people to understand the history of the CAPS10.  Without the descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would unknown to many.     The novel, PERSON4 in the CAPS11, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiney, teenager.  The author, PERSON2, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters.  The charachters, however, are high school boys that live at a boarding school.  To water down the language or to make the novel 'kid friendly' would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters.  The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations.  These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of plot as well as the changing charachter traits of the protagonist, PERSON1.     Literature is not the only medium being targetted by those trying to completely censor libraries.  Music, movies, magazines, and videogames are being targeted as well.  In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them.  It should be remembered that it is the CAPS3 responsibility to censor materials for their children.  Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a diurnal occurence.  CAPS1 patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences.     In conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. Librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries.  Libraries should present a wide variety of books, movies, etc. to the public.  If libraries do this, it becomes the responsiblity of either the CAPS3 or the individual to pick out books that are within personal boundaries",0
"Libraries have alot of material to read about. They have childrens books to adult books. All of the books vary on different age groups. So many people go to the libary a day. But the question is, should certin materials be taken off the shelfts because they are found offensive? The answer is no.     When people go to the libary, that means they want to learn something, or find something to intertain them. When you go to the libary to reserch something, and they do not have the book you need, or the movie you need, what are you going to do? What happends when you are doing a project over something, and they do not have the book you need? Do you want your children failing in school because they libaries take materials off the shelfs?      People should not take materials off the shelfs beucase 'they do not like it.' If they think it is offensive, then they should put it back on the shelf and go find something else. They do not have to take it off the shelf because they are agenst it. Everyone has different beleafs on things.      Libaries have different sections to go find materials at. It varies from kids, fiction, and nonfiction. It also sometimes goes by what you are looking for. No one should take something off the shelf if it is offensive because it was their choose to look at it in the first place. No one can tell you what you can and cant look at when you go to a libary. If they do not like what they see, then put it down. It is that easy. If you can not find what you are looking for, then libaries also have computers to look up things",0
"Laughter can be a very important thing in everyones life because, its something that can help you in many ways. As far as I remeber laughter has helped me get thru alot of emotional problems that I would have with alot of my ex boyfriends. One day my mom saw me crying because my ex had broken up with me and I got really upset so the only thing my mom said to me was that ""laughter was the best medican""at that point I didn't understand what she was trying to say, but now that im getting older I start to realize what she ment with that is that being bummbed about something like that is just useless, and that I had to live my life to the fullest because I was to young to cry over someone who I jst had a simple crush on and she was totally right about that. But then again its not only for boyfriend and girlfriend thing it's also to keep a healthy friendship with your friends Laughter is a way to show how you feel inside. Even when I dont feel like laughing I still do because thats a way to show people that im a strong and independent girl who knows how to take care of herself and live her life. I also try to make the people around me laugh and just have a good time when we hang out because they create the best memories. I'm accually surprised in how much a simple laugh or smile can make someone feel better and sometimes one person can make another one smile just by simply laughing at the most siplest things.   In the other hand there are people who fake laugh meaning that they just laugh but its not that they are laughin because they think yewr funny they are laughin becasue they think yewr acting dumb. But the truth is that sometimes its hard to see whose the real people from the fake because there are many people who fake laugh just to pretend that they like you when they really dont and i truly think thats dumb because you end up beliving that they are your friends when all they do is laugh behind your back. But i dont let that get to me because those kind of people are the kind that its not even worth to take your time with .When i make the people that i care about smile and just have a good time also makes me happy because it makes me feel like i've made a difference in that certain persons day, i kno i cant change their life but I can always try to make their day a little easier by just making them laugh. My little three month old sister is always laughin, always cracking up for no apperant reason and its kinda funny to watch becasue when she laughs I laugh to, thats kinda what I ment to say when i say that a simple smile or laugh from one person to another can make a difference. i mean shes only three months ans shes always happy and always has a smile on her face for no reason, sometimes without knowing shemakes my day even better when she starts laughing out of the blue which i think its somewhat cute.  My mom sometimes tries to make laugh because she knows that I sometimes have bad days at school and she tries her best to make me laugh because when i laugh it makes me forget about al my problems and everything, but i know that laughin cant always be all good, for excample laughin at other peoples pain is just bad and thats something that isnt funny and people do laugh at other people which can really hurt someone. Meaning in many ways laughin can be good or bad but that also depends in the person who is laughin..",0
"Based on the article, ""the Mooring Mast"" by ORGANIZATION2, there are many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ORGANIZATION2 states in paragraph NUM1, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons have been aparent before it was ever constructed."" One reason was safety. The dirigibles that were made outside of LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, thats wrong because hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was because of the winds. They constantly change, they are violent air currents, and they moved the dirigible. The other reason and most important reason is because dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because its illegal.

"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, Lüsted addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As Lüsted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects MONEY1!The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe he cause they would be dangling above pedestrians. The many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful.",0
"Hope, a new beginning, adjustment-all are reasons why the speaker concludes by saying when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again That hibiscus flower gives that girl hope because it remind her of her grandmother and back home, how wonderful things were back there, and by the flower blooming, she realize it could wear out there too. Shell also have a new beging in the spring, by spring she should adjust to her surrounding and have new friends, things to do, and new memories to look back on, that looking backabout flawall won't be as bad the flower will bring her hope and comfort with her adjustment.",0
"DATE1 was the start of a new age, i had just turned NUM1, what a joy i thought that was. i was so existed for my birthday party, that i couldn't even bare it. my mom asked what i wanted to do for my birthday, i told her that i wanted to have a party and a sleep over. she agreed, so that night we planed and made invitations. that week flew by and before i new it, it was party time. i invited NUM2 of my best friends and all of my family. we had such a good time that the time just flew by and it was time for everybody to go, three of my friends stayed the night there was, PERSON1, barbie, and CAPS1. my parents whet to a party of there own and we were staying at home all night by ourselves. it was around TIME1 and we were all watching hills have eyes. we all herd a big crash, from up star, we all went up stars and saw that my self had been knock down and we all freaked out. we ran down stars screaming, i called my mom and thinking that someone was in the home they rushed home thinking it was a real emergency. my mom and dad went up stars to check it out and they found that it was my black cat mouse he had gotten in through my window and jumped on my self not sturdy enough it clapped.",0
"The issue before us is that people are addicted to computer. S I think we are not. In addition to all this some people can task and many things like hang out with there family and friend but most importantly enjoy life. In a way computer privliges can be as like your enjoying life. Say if you an your friend has the same computer which includes webcam, video messaging and more. That's life well what im trying to say is that yall can talk see each other, have private conversations. Computer's dont alway take you away from the important people or things in life. Some computers can help you, you can take school, learn how to write essays, learn how to read, and much more. Computers can be a success to some people. Only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself you cant blame it on a computer. Imagine life without a computer what would you do? How can you survive? For example if you were giving some homework that you had to do on the computer and theres was no way for you to do that project in school. How would you do it? Some people need computers. I think if they thought and knew we was going to get so excited about how cool our computers' are they shouldnt so much new technologies in our life. Now you can probably see why I think we need computer and how it can sometime benefit our society.",0
"My newest botfriend and i have been dateing for well almost NUM1 months on DATE1 it will be a year. We have a lot of fun together we talk about anything we dont rreally ride bikes or go jogging we have just started to work out togther.

He also has been one of the best friends i have ever and hopefully we will betogether for a long time.",0
"The author of Winter Hibiscus made a good choice to conclude the story with when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again. This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become almost familiar to her now The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saengs life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her obstacle, and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saengs life will have come full circle.",0
Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tirerd less quickly making his journey easyer. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist.,0
"A time when I had to be patient was at my dance audition. Every year at ORGANIZATION1 grove college I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance, there were about NUM1 people in the dance room. I worked very hard when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didnt get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldnt get anything. One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost MONEY1 and MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but dont give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them.",0

"NEWSPAPER     CAPS1 today im going to tell you what I think on offensive materials in libraries.Offensive materials such as books,magazines,music,movies are found in libraries to some people.But to others they can think its perfectly ok to have in a public place.Thinking somethings offensive is just an opinion and every person has a different look on things.     The first thing I have to say about this topic is that these items should not just be taken off the shelves and thrown away.Some people can find these items very educational and they might be able to relate to that  book that other people would say is offensive.And if offensive materials are really bothering some people and the libraries are getting alot of complaints they should just make a section in the library just for the offensive books,movies,ect.So people wont have to look at those offensive materials.Another thing is that libraries are a public place and they should have a wide range of books,movies,ect.Because not every one likes the same thing.People have different intrests and outlooks on different things.So people should just except the things that they might not be into because other people might be really into that.And dont always just think about yourself look at the big picture.     So there are some of my thoughts and feelings on what I think about offensive materials in libraries.And I hope that you can see my point that im trying to get across.",0
"Based on the excerpt, builders faced many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety would be a large problem. Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law. In conclusion, many problems arose as building, and plans to make the ""Dirigible dock"" were made.",0
The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to show how sentimental and important the plant is to Saeng. She will take that test again when the winter is over because it's too cold for nice hibiscus to survive. You need a winter hibiscus. Not like the kind we had before (NUM1). This shows how important it is that she finds a hibiscus like the ones she had at home. She shows dissapointment in herself until that last paragraph when she shows courage and strong will.,0
"The seven books which constitute the 'CAPS1 CAPS2' series by PERSON1 are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. Many books, from PERSON2's 'The CAPS3 in the CAPS4' to the 'CAPS1 CAPS2' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account. Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive.      Under the ORGANIZATION1 to the CAPS7, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press and religion. By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied. It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right.      By prohibiting books such as 'CAPS1 CAPS2' or 'The CAPS3 in the CAPS4' to be read; the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded. Many conservative CAPS12 groups have advocated that 'CAPS1 CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that PERSON3 has stated that PERSON4 (the CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual. However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of LOCATION1.      However, even if every school in the country took 'CAPS1 CAPS2' off the shelves; that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books. Since 'The CAPS3 in the CAPS4' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the DATE1, it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute. That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'.      If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. But just because one parent does not want their child to read 'CAPS1 CAPS2', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere.      Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of LOCATION1 from these offensive works; the children will still find a way to access them",0
"My opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out. If someone I knew spent all day long on the computer I would tell him or her head on that he or she sould go out side and get some fresh air and get some exrcise. Some times the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer. Although the computer can be quit helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or biuld things, and to meet new people, But, the computer can be a dangerous place as well you can meet someone who is lieing about their age that person might rape or miurderkill you. If you spend twenty-four seven on the computer you could be paralized from lack of exercise or get lumf ophemia thats when your body a pears and will not be a to exercise and would need special treatments. Like masogise. Computers can also be good because it can give you hand eye coordination by useing the still looking sometimes some people for useing the computer: videos, video, and websites. You can get your computer uloaded for for quality. Some systems howe computers in them or can be connected to the computer like the, and the CAPS1 NUM1 CAPS2. There are games called p.c. games some p.c. games comeucicate with childern to teach them how to write, read, spell, and pronounce words. There are also spiecal computers andor web-sites you can search for tutorial for speaking different langueges. There are also sites you can search for tutorials for playing instroments. Some people use the computer to fill their emptynis inside of them inistead of eating. Some people obeuse the compeuter as a dug like they're addictied to it. Imagine someone addictied to computers every where heshe goes they would take their laptop with them. Many people have died useing the computer but thats because they obeused it. Everyday people buy computers this invention is very helpful as time goes on sciantists are makeing new things to save llives.",0
"Patience is hard for me because I have almost no patients for anything! So you can imagine how hard it was for me and anyone else who has no patience waiting in lines at disneyland. First of all the drive- it was horrible and long. We were in the car for what seemed like forever before we finally got there. I tried my best to be patient and I wa s. I didnt complain at all. When we got to disneyland the firs day the lines were terrible! Some of the waits were up t NUM1 hours long! Well i didnt complain,but it was hard not to!My little brother wanted to go on all these kid rides that the lines were huge for , but i held my patients not wanting to get anyone upset. Since I like everything to get done fast and not waste my time waiting i felt like i was going to explode at dinner. Dinner was a this seafood resteraunt wich was bad anyway because i hate seafood!while all this waiting was happening I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! Even worse was waiting for the disney busses to get back to your hotel. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me keeping my patients through all of the waiting. I learned all lot of things there. One disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient.

"Your watching a movie on tv that you and your friend have seen in theatres. You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the tv skips over that part because people think that that sceen is inapropiate. Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strick when it comes to movies, music, and books.     Some of the movies that are popular will end up on tv for the viewers entertainment, CAPS1 some movies have sceens that are a little inapropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the tv compaies will cut that sceen out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The tv companies even censor historical movies. If its a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story.     Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids. If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music.     Book tend to be censored and even banned at schools. Not too many childrens read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want besause reading helps the mind. Some schools banned books becuse of inapropiate language. That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime. Some books are just too good to be banned.     A lot of theings seem to be censored in this world. We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so stricked when it comes to movies, music, and books.",0
"In our socioty, a lot of people and places take offense to certain things. In my opinion, librarys and book stores should not remove things from their shelves becuase they could be offensive.     People have the right to pick something up, over look it, and decide wheither it's offensive or not. If a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could get to them bad enough for them to freak out and complain to places that are selling it, then that book or movie probably shouldnt have been made.     I agree, somethings are offensive, but if someone you dont know wrote it or directed it, then dont let it bother you. I believe that music is a way that people express themselves. I honestly don't think that music should be censored when it's sold in any store. If the material is to graphic for children or some people, then don't listen to it. If you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read, listen, or watch them, then maybe you just should do it.",0
"Libraries are often thought of as a room full of books inside a school building. On the contrary, they are all over the country, and are used by people of all ages. Because of that, I feel that there should not be a restriction on what books a library puts on their shelves. If the books and magazines are labeled, then a person can just stay away from what he or she finds offensive. However, in the case of a school library, all the books of course should be age appropriate.     Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean you neighbor won't. If someone find a movie ridiculous and inappropriate, that doesn't mean someone else will too. Since all people are different, no one will like the same movies as the next person. Therefor, a personally offensive movie should not be removed from the shelves and prevent the enjoyment of another individual. That is the same with magazines, books, and anything available at a library.         Parental concern for their children is also a factor. However, if a public library has a section of books or magazines that is found to be offensive by a parent of a young child, I do not think that should require the library to remove the book. This is where I believe organization and limitations come in. The adult books and magazines that might be offensive for children should be in a section in a separate room, or on a different level of the building. That would prevent the accidental discovery by children. Along with organization, I think there should be a limitation, so that if a child was to purposely walk into that section and grab a book that was not appropriate, or offensive to the parent, then they would not be able to check it out at the desk from the librarian.     Outside of public libaries, the school libraries have a different requirement in my opinion. Elementary libraries of course, should contain no inappropriate material to any extent.All of the material in an elementary library should be strictly for education. At that age, children are far too young for any form of adult humor or magazine article. At the CAPS1 and CAPS2 CAPS3 level, I think things should change a little, but should still be much more strict than a public library, and contain absolutely no offensive content. I feel that magazines and joke books are welcome in the libraries of teenagers. Nothing that would be inappropriate for the school rules though of course.      Public libraries are a place for children and adults alike to find a book or movie to entertain themselves, and everyone has a different opinion. Because of that, there should be no restrictions in the public libraries, and you should be able to get the books or movies you want. Within a school corporation the environment changes, and the rules must be changed as well. Nothing offensive should be placed within a school library no matter how old the students are. Libraries should not be required to remove books from their shelves.",0
"Books mean a lot to people that love to read. Books have pictures, or they MONTH1 even be poem books. Some books should not be on the shelves in libraries. They have offesive language and not so well of pictures. They MONTH1 be learning books but the little kids do not need to see that. I think books should be removed from the shevles if found offensive.      Libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not. The books, movies, music, ect. needs to be in a certain section of the library to where the little kids can not go or reach. A library is a family place not a fun zone for adults.     On DATE1, I went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him. CAPS2 is only six about to be seven. He had told me he wanted to get a book about dinosuars, but I told him to get one on space and aliens. CAPS2 was very into reading. He  read to our mom everynight before he would go to bed. We were walking down CAPS1 street when a bolt of lighting struck through the trees. 'ekkkk!' said CAPS2 as he ran around me. We walk into the library and the old lady at the front desk says, 'there is a huge storm coming.' We sorta ignore her and go on about our bussiness picking our books for CAPS2. CAPS2 and I walk up stairs to the childrens section. CAPS2 is looking around and he says 'hey kayla, what is this and he picks up a naughty magaizine. i rush over to snach it out of his hands and he gets scared. He ask 'but sissy what is that?' I do not respond. I tell him to pick a book and come on. He grabs one and we are on our way to get it checked out and the lights go off. It was completely dark. 'CAPS3 stay calm.' a man says. The back up lights come on and we all go to the lobby area. We sit there for twenty mins and the lights are back on. Everything is normal again and we go to check out. We get up to the front and i turn in the bad magazine that CAPS2 had found. The lady askd why I was bringing it to her and i had to tell her the bad news, that it was up in the childrens section. She said 'oh my!' CAPS2 laid his books up on the counter and we checked out. We walked out the front doors and we were on our way home.",0

"but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kidsteens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visted the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!",0

"The mood created by the author is fairly formal, with a few informal parts. For example a formal paragraph, like paragraph number one, sets the stage of the whole memoir and uses formal transitions like ""After [living]"". Also, the paragraph is very informative, telling about his parents imigrating to the ORGANIZATION1 from Cuba and how they were financially poor + could not afford a fancy home like they could in Cuba.An informal paragraph in the memoir is a paragraph like number six where he is describing how thankful he is for his parents being as selfless and giving as they are.

It also just has an informal tone to that paragraph.As a conclusion these parts of the memoir have a good balance of formal + informal settings to keep the reader engaged.",0
"CAPS2 people think that computers are used too much, and are helping people become over weight, and even obese. This is maybe true, but computers also teach hand eye coordination, give people the oppertunity to learn about far away places, and people can even coordinate on them! Over all I think computers effect people in a positive way, and these are some reasons why. Computers help teach hand eye coordination. I know your probably thinking huh? How do computers do that? All your doing is staring at a screen. But to your dismay computers do teach hand eye coordination. It does this because while playing games, people watch the screen, and click with their hands. They dont just stare at the mouse while they play these games. By doing so, it teaches hand eye coordination. Scientist have provine that people who own a computer and use it at least NUM1 hours a week, have better coordination that people who dont own a computer by PERCENT1! Just that statistic alone speaks a thousand words alone. Hand-eye coordination is a thing. It helps you play better in sports like baseball, and not only that but it helps future jobs. As you can tell, CAPS1, without computers out hand eye coordination. People think that computers are only used for games, but in reality, they teach us CAPS2 things about the world. Without computers people would know about nearly anything thats going in other countries. For example, the other day, my mom was checking her email and came access the stay of a young, starving. That are story changer her anyday life because takes food for granted. Without computer my mom would have more in other countries. Because we live in the CAPS4.S whats going on in other countries. Are less fortanite, but computer help remind and teach us whats going in the world everyday. One of the main advantages about computers is they allow people to communicate through them. Even my grandmother said the, without computers, I wouldnt be as close to you as I am today. CAPS5 and my grandmother use the website skype.com. This websit allows you to not only talk to the other person, but to see them too! Because of site like these. Im allowed to stay in contact, and be able to see my grandmother who lives faraway. Without computers this wouldnt be possible. Not only do computers let you talk to people far away, but people close too. I often find myself asking friends over the computer, what the homework is, or whens the next test, etc. Computers make it easier to connect to people near and far. In conclusion, computers help in all different ways. The world would be upside down without them. They give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, teach hand eye coordination, and allow people to communicate with each other. Computers have CAPS2 flaws, but they also have so CAPS2 positive effects too that I think they shine over all the tiny flaws. Thank you",0

"As a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in construction the mast. The first problem was structural, the weight of the dirigible tied it with a single tie would put great stress on the building. It was said between the dirigible's load and wind pressure the stress would be distributed all the way to foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium which is highly flamable. The owners realized the ""Hindenburg"" incident and realized the effects it could of had on downtown New York. The final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building. The problem discussed on this was despite the dirigibles being tied, it could swivel around the mast. The many obstacles faced led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose and blimps were less commodly used.",0
When I first saw my puppy CAPS3 were at ORGANIZATION2. The CAPS1 CAPS2 brought over some dog to be rescued CAPS3 saw all six dogs second one I saw I knew he was going to be mine. So CAPS3 got him out the lady said that hes scared and he gets carsick but I didnt care he was my favorite. CAPS3 said CAPS3 wanted him so she told us to go to the CAPS1 CAPS2 and tell them CAPS3 wanted CAPS4 so CAPS3 raced to the CAPS1 CAPS2 and on the way there CAPS3 thought of names. My dad came up with the name CAPS6 CAPS3 liked it so that was his name I had to wait a whole week before I could take him home but as long as I got my puppy I was fine CAPS3 got him a toy when CAPS3 went back to see him I had it with every night knowing I was closer and closer to getting him the day finally came. CAPS3 told my brother CAPS3 were going fishing since he didnt know CAPS3 were getting a dog. But once CAPS3 there I ran inside to go see him CAPS3 took him home he was afraid of everything even leaves outside. But CAPS7 he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow. And every night I tell CAPS6 its bed time and I sleep with my wonderful ORGANIZATION1. Because if you want something bad enough patient is the key.,0
"Laughter is a CAPS1 CAPS2 do things like music, tears and laughter have in common? CAPS19're all universal languages- CAPS19 surpass any CAPS1 barriers to get the point across without words. CAPS21 was definitely the case the time my CAPS3's best friend PERSON3 came to visit from LOCATION2.  I was eight at the time. I'd lived in LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. When my CAPS3 announced that her college roommate PERSON3 was coming for a few days along with her family, I felt some apprehension at the idea of trying to talk to them. However, my CAPS3 was encouraging. ""CAPS4 will be a learning experience!"" was her enthusiastic war cry any time I whined. ""CAPS5'll learn some CAPS6, and CAPS19'll learn some CAPS7.""  CAPS4 was a cold, stormy ORGANIZATION2 day when CAPS19 arrived. As CAPS19 pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I CAPS12 felt shy. After all, I only had faint memories of my ""CAPS9"" PERSON3's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. However, my sense of worry was soon replaced by CAPS9 PERSON3's rich voice: ""CAPS11! CAPS5've gotten so tall!"" CAPS12 I was enfolded in her warm embrace, and I smelled the familiar smell of my CAPS9: chocolate, detergent, and something spicy as if she'd just been cooking. Soon ORGANIZATION1 had moved on to greeting my younger sister and I was left awkwardly standing next to ORGANIZATION1's three children. I realized that I didn't know CAPS2 to say- or even how to say anything to them. While PERSON3 was bilingual, yet she didn't speak CAPS7 around her children. There was a total CAPS1 barrier. The awkwardness passed momentarily when the adults intervened. PERSON3 bustled into our silent mass and began introducing us. Her oldest was tall, dark haired PERSON1, who was the ancient and worldly age of twelve. Closest to my age was nine year old CAPS14, who had a quick smile and a mischievous glint in her eye. The youngest, PERSON2, was petite even for her tender age of four. I smiled and nodded as each was introduced, and smiled and nodded some more as PERSON3 introduced me and my sister CAPS15 to them. As CAPS19 chattered back at her in CAPS6, I marveled at how clever CAPS19 seemed for speaking another CAPS1. How, I wondered, did my CAPS7 sound to them?  My CAPS3 soon ushered us into the house. She had begun making dinner, and PERSON3 joined her in our small kitchen to ""catch up on life."" For a while, we kids stayed close to our parents, like birds hesitating to leave the nest. Soon, however, CAPS4 became apparent that seven people was too many to fit in one kitchen. ""CAPS18 don't CAPS5 go show them your rooms?"" my CAPS3 suggested. ""CAPS19 still haven't met CAPS20!"" CAPS21 seemed like a good idea, since CAPS20, our cat, was friendly to anyone and everyone. CAPS15 and I led the way to to find him while the CAPS23 talked in hushed CAPS6 voices behind us.  As we got to the living room, PERSON2 CAPS12 let out a squeal. She ran across the floor to CAPS20, who had been napping in the sun. I was worried that she would startle him, but the overweight tabby simply got up sleepily and yawned. And then, to our amazement, CAPS20 did something he'd never done before. He jumped up and placed his hind legs on PERSON2's chest. He was a large cat, and she was small, so CAPS4 turned out so that he was looking her in the eye. For a moment, CAPS19 looked at each other, surprised, and then she fell down into a sitting position. Worried she might cry, I started to go over to help, but then something entirely different escaped out of her mouth: the contagious laugh of a four year old. For a moment, there was a surprised silence from the rest of us as she howled at the hilarity of CAPS4, but soon we couldn't help but join in. And in that moment, I realized that we didn't even have to learn each other's languages- the laughter that we'd shared had broken the ice and the CAPS1 barrier.  I still remember that visit fondly today, because CAPS4's the first time that I realized how alike other cultures are to our own. True, we had a hard time relating at the beginning. But by the end, we had become friends, all because of a cat, a four year old, and the one CAPS1 we did have in common- laughter.",0
"Patience. Being patient means that you needs to make and dor one' thing constantly to make one????understand. That is patience. My mom is patient. When I dart understand a problem, she will explain CAPS1 to me, never in rush. She don't yell a t me when I don't understand, unlike my dad, who is very impatient. He would yell, and possiblely cursed at me in chinease. That happens nearly every time I don't understand something. But my mom will contune explain to me until I understand what CAPS1 means.

"In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

And it CAPS1 wasn't a reasonable thing to build, the empire state building was already tall enough, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway.",0
"Computers can affect the way people are and how they interact. Why is there a need to spend your precious life sitting in front of a compute all day?When you can be getting exercise for example going to your local gym. Computers become a distraction to your social life, thats why you should use them for emergency's and spend more time with your wonderful family and friends. Lastly you can enjoy you surrounding and appreciate life and nature. Computers are meant for business not for people to sit around and to nonsense things. Exercise is very important it helps the human body grow and stay in fit. If your sitting in front of a computer all day your body is going to shut down and won't get the proper exercise. Sports can be just as enjoyable and helps build the human body and gives you the right amount of exercise that your body needs. Sports also build hand and eye coordination just like if your sitting on the couch using a computer. In conclusion exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you but it also benefits citizens more. Family is a wonderful thing in life, but they don't live forever. That's why we should cherries every last moment we have with them. A complete citizens and drives them from family and friends. Computers can take away your social life and you never do go out and meet people and friends. To sum things up computers are a to citizens and cause them to drive out family and friends. Nature is exotic and beautiful and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have. Computers can become harmful to nature and destroy homes for animals, for example when you print something from your computer it prints if out on paper. This causes more trees to be knocked down and cut for paper. We should only use paper for emergency's and not splurge on it. We all want the world to be a better place so stop destroying it for our own benefits! In conclusion computers just in the and will cause chaos and destruction. Instead of using them we could be getting the right amount of exercise, and spending it with family, and lastly enjoying nature and our surroundings. I strongly consider that you take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them.",0
"The builders had a very hard time because of where it was located, and how the dirigible was to dock. Their first problem was the fact that it was so tall, it was hard to work on. Another problem was the fact that the blimp would be pulling in on the building, so it had to be reinforced. The final problems that made them most an unreliable choice, were the wind conditions and the fact that the tail end of the blimp could swing freely. These all contributed to make the mast on the Empire State Building a bad idea.",0

It all started one DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids too because we all could go and play on it whenever we wanted. We were always over at my cousins house after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest trick. Sometimes we would fall off or one of us would get hurt and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while but they would always cave and let us back on it.

"The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was the height of the building. For instance in paragraph NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"" This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced",0

"With all due respect to anyone that thinks the computer doesn't benefit society, I strongly disagree. Yes, there are many people that neglect other activities to be on the comuter, and yes, the computer is an invention that a lot of people depend on, but the computer is also an invention that we can benefit from in many positive ways. For example, CAPS1' PERSON1, a hip-hop artist with millions of fans, wasn't able to finish high school or go to colledge because of his career. He decided to get a colledge degree, so he started to attend a colledge. He had difficulty being in colledge, however, because he was constantly being harrassed by his fans, so he started going to colledge online. That way, he was able to focus on his studies and get his degree without the harrassment. The computer also has websites on the internet that are used in schools. They help teach students in a way that they will have fun and enjoy what they're doing, giving them a better learning experience. Aside from the positive uses of the internet, the computer also contains progams that can benefit us just as well. Microsoft CAPS2, for example is a program on the computer that is used to create CAPS2 documents such as peoms, essays, song lyric, and even letters. You can print out these CAPS2 documents to have a copy of your ownn to keep and show people wherever you go, but if your not finished, it can be saved on your computer. People use the computer for many things, books, movies and so one. Over the years that its been existance, its benefited us al lot. What do you think?",0

But does that mean I should take it off the shelf and throw it away because I'm not allowed to read it? No. As much as I would like to, just to prevent others from reading it, I cannot. It is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place.     I think the area where the most offensive things are, are movies. There are so many movies now that have inappropriate scenes: bad language, scary scenes, etc. Some movies are not rated appropriately either. There is a movie out now that is rated NUM1 and is extremely scary. I cannot imgaine watching this movie as a middle schooler; I watched it as a sophomore and was scared. I never would have though it would have been that bad because of its rating. Some movies for children even have inappropriate things; they might be hidden and the child not understand, but it is still there. Why does it need to be there in the first place? Is it that important? No.     Another area that is bad, are video games. There are kids who play them so much, all they think about is killing, guns, and war. There are kids who think of these things so much they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids. Some do it in a joking way, but others do not. These things are dangerous and hurt people-mentally and even emotionally.      You go to a grocery store or a gas station and see magazines with inappropriate things on them. No child should see those things, but if they are there anyone is going to look.     Different genres of music MONTH1 even send bad messages. There are some radio stations that, with certain songs, bleep out words like drugs and alcohol, but with other songs that have curse words, keep them there. I do not really understand that. Yes, drugs and alcohol are bad, but why isn't a curse word? Just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad.       These types of things are very offensive to people. But is there really anything they can do? Not really. We all have our opinions and we can speak our minds, but sometimes we do not get want we always want. We cannot really do anything about this. Others belive it is okay to watch and listen and read these kinds of things, but with the things we read, watch, adn list to on a regular basis are what we think about. If you put bad things in your mind that is all you will begin to think about and it will become a part of your life",0
One rainy day my dad's leg was brothering him. He took medican but that didn't work so we took him to the hospitle in coro. They looked at his leg and they told us we had to the hospitel in covent hospitle in LOCATION1 so we got on our way to LOCATION1. When we got to the hospitle these was like NUM1 people in the wating room. My dad had patience to wait. When we had to go in the room. My dad had to get x-rays. He was also had enough patience to wait to see what was wrong. When he found out what was wrong. He had to wait even longer to see if he had to get surgey on his legs well after he had all the patience he had to go through surgey. He had enough patience to go through surgey. It is a good thing my dad had all the patience because his legs are all better I didn't think my dad had enough patience.,0
"Middleton middle school, Im one of their students. My name is CAPS1, Im new here, but you MONTH1 think that Im a boy. Well if you do you better listen and listen hard CAPS16 Im not going to say this twice; patience is a vurture. On my first day, I walked into PERSON1s class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. CAPS2. CAPS3 said. my names CAPS4. CAPS3 said in a perky voice. CAPS2. I said back. Im CAPS6, but you can call me CAPS1. CAPS8, uh CAPS1. CAPS4 replied. CAPS11 let me show you around. CAPS12! I answered back. CAPS4 and I became fast friends,but when CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boys name. CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said CAPS13 was CAPS17. CAPS4 just wouldent let CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, CAPS13s CAPS17 CAPS4! Just let me handle this. CAPS15? CAPS3 asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way CAPS3 did when CAPS3 couldent do same thing. CAPS16 you just dont have any patience! I said, getting a little angry CAPS3 couldent understand. CAPS17 be that way  CAPS1! CAPS3 said storming out of the room. CAPS4 wait! I cried but I hat to run after her. CAPS20, please you dont get CAPS13. You cant keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its CAPS17. Have you ever had of patience before? I asked ready to run if CAPS3 ran from me. CAPS21. CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about CAPS13 and we never had a problem again.",0
"CAPS2 people think that computers are good for socity but I do not. Computer's riskes out weighs the benighits. My first example is my father. My father never turned on a computer in his life and his buisness is doing fine. My father and his father has all of their records in a safe. One of my fathers friends had everything on his computer. When a virus hit it all of his files were gone and along with his records. My father handwrites all of his papers. He says if i need to type something out i'll buy a type writer. Also on things like facebook someone can see everything that another is doing. This is were alot of people pose as someone eles and thus CAPS2 people get kidnapped or killed. A very good reason is that when people have alot of personal information when a virus hitls that person knows everything about you that you put on. For exampel i was watching a show on discovery channel when a man hacked into a myspace acount and used that persons name to people and try to create a cyder to the pentagon, that person almost got caught but never was. So you can see why my family does not like computers. My family is always at the farm or in the barn working on we have no time to be on the internet the only thing you need it for is school work. What ever happened to the old fasion way no computer, no problems.",0
"Have CAPS3 ever been in that mood were CAPS3 just can not stop laughing, and no matter what, CAPS3 just can't stop? That is the problem my good friend, PERSON1. PERSON1 and I have when we are together. Most of the time we are just talking about random things and we both find it hilarious. Luckily, for the teachers, we only have two classes together. In both of those classes we sit next to each other though. So the teachers didn't luck out too much.  Just the other day, in CAPS1 CAPS2, we were allowed to move are seats around and have that be our new spot in the class. The girl that was sitting next to me moved and sat next to PERSON1. Now, ORGANIZATION1 doesn't like this girl very much, so I spoke up and said ""PERSON1, CAPS3 can sit next to me!"". PERSON1 grabbed her stuff in an unusually quick manner, and came and sat next to me. The funny thing was when she sat down she said ""CAPS3 saved my life."". For some reason PERSON1 and I just started laughing non-stop. We couldn't control it. To be honest, it wasn't that funny. I guess it was just in the way she said I saved her life. I'm glad PERSON1 sits next to me in CAPS1 CAPS2. With out her, it would be so boring.  In CAPS6, we sit next to each other and we have a good time. Our CAPS6 class is at the end of the day so we are just ready to go home by then. PERSON1 and I sit next to each other and when we are taking notes, PERSON1 and I pass notes back-and-forth to each other. She and I talk about everything, from the predicaments a teenage girl runs into in high school, to boys and parents. I can pretty much tell her everything, and that's a good friend. Over the years PERSON1 and I have become closer and closer friends. Last year, she and I had at least three or four classes together. So we have been in classes together previously. PERSON1 and I have become more acquainted and more open with things. I tell her everything and she tells me everything. One reason why I think we've become good friends is because she and I find the same things funny. We have the same interests in things.She is a good friend and I'm glad she's my friend . Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I am going to definitely have to agree with that.",0
"The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit greatly affected the cyclist in the story. Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (kurmaskie). the cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy, than flat riding.

Then in paragraph NUM2 the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about.

"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In paragraph NUM1, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail.",0
When I was in fourth grade and I was going to a concert and I had to be very patient. I was waiting in a long line to get in. While I was in line I started talking to my friends we played games and walked a few steps up every a minutes. I sat there and walked up with my mom and sat down again and it was just seemed like the line wasnt moving at all! Finally we got up to the front and me and my friends were so excited. Being patient payed off because if I would have bothered my mom too much she might have gotten mat at me. I had a lot of fun after I got into then concert. That was a time that I was patient.,0
"If you get offended because of a book, magazine, music, or movies than don't read, watch, or listen to it. America shouldn't be censored.     Censorship should be fo young childen. If your grown and get offended by something having the 'CAPS1-word' on it then don't read it. If a movie drops the 'CAPS1-bomb' then don't watch it. i completly disagree with someone wanting to remove vulgar words.     I don't get offeneded by swearing because its usually used in a funny way, like telleing jokes, or it makes a crappy song good. Censoship is helpful, but vulgar things shouldn't be removed from society, and it never will.          More often than not, kids learn cuss words fom paents or friends. If you don't want your kid to cuss or be surrounded by cussing then remove them from that situation. It's the parents responsibility to protect or 'censor' a childs environment.",0
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was figuring a practical and safe way to dock the dirigibles. Practicity and safety were an obstacle because the builders of the Empire State building were the first to attempt a docking dirigibles on air, CAPS1 they had no past trials to refer to. In this project practicity and safety worked together. For example ""..engineers [had] to dope out a practical, workable arrangement..."" CAPS1 that the airships could be moored to the mast easily and secure. This would assure the passengers safety as well as stability to the building.The second obstacle the builders faced was distributing the stress added to the building as the dirigible docked. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" CAPS2 all of this stress to the foundation was a challenge because the foundation ""... was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another challenge that arose was that, to accommodate this situation ""the steelframe [of the building had] to be modified and strengthened..."" The modification to the buildings framework was worth ""over sixty thousand dollars..."" In conclucion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to dock dirigibles in their building.",0

"There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the short cut that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength.

"I had a friend well she is CAPS4 best friend and we know each other from NUM1 grade then in NUM2 grade she said she said she has to move to LOCATION1. So she moved and she would call me all the like two time a week. I would always answer and talk to her for about three hours. I will always remember her. Until this one day came she called and NUM3 was kind of busy because there were people over are house. One of CAPS4 mom friend calls me and I told  CAPS1 (CAPS4 best  friend) hold on someone is calling me she said okay so I left the phone on CAPS4 bed while she  was still o the phone.

"Yes, there are a lot of books out there that have graphic and sexual phrases, and there are alot of concernd parents out there that are worried about what the libraries are possibly letting their kids read. One good idea would be to put age limit signs in certain areas on the libraries, that dosent neccisarrly mean that the kid is goin to listen to that sign.           We all know for a fact that pornagraphy will stay away from libraries and stay were they are at right now so thats not an issue the parents should worry about. I think the libraries should be broken onto sections. Theres a kid section, a teen section, and a adult section, but i don't think that the adult section should be to far off the teen section because when we say adult books or magazines everybody expects it to be one thing, porn. It should still be some type of book with some kind of censorship to it.      There should be doors blocking each entrance to each section of books, and to get to them you to show the librarian some proof of age to be able to get into those sections, except the kid section. The kid section is a section that all kids can use, because we know that that section of books would be harmless to kids. I think that with that kind of security it would let parents to be able to be less stressed and worried for their childs safety and insecurity of the mind.     There are tons of other ideas to explore to be able to try and keep books with some kind of censorship but most of them are off the wall and rediculus. I think that musoc and movies shouldn't even be in libraries just leave those to other stores it's better to let stores deal with that than libraries. The librarian probably dosen't even know half the cds that probably get checked out anyways. So it's best if you don't have those in there at all.     Give some thought to these ideas that I just sprong at you. I personally think that having doors blocking to get to certain books would be a great plan to use, because it would block access to these areas from certain kids. Some other parents or people might have ideas of there own and it would be great to hear them or have some kind of bullitun about them around the city ofr town",0
"Builders of the empire state building faced challenging obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock their ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself"" This was a huge problem for the mooring masts because they could not get close enough to the building to land. The winds were too strong. Secondly, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" meaning that because there were so many people in a small area of downtown New York it was too dangerous for dirigibles and other aircrafts to be that low. Lastly dirigibles from outside of the state used hydrogen rather then helium ""hydrogen is highly flameable"" After the German Hindenburg had an accident with fire it was clear that taking the risk of an accident like that happen above the heads of thousands of pedestrians was a bad idea. The obstacles, which were noticed too late; before the construction, is why the dirigables are not allowed to land on the Empire State building to this day.",0

"In my opinion i don't really think certain items should be romoved from the library. I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing. In my personal opinion I never remove anything from a library because I know their are alot of people with many interests. At the same time I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library, beacuse they could not appropriate for childrern. If we removed cerain items from the library people would get mad.      I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things. There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area, and others are in another area. We can aslo make sure that no under age kid can go to an adult area. If we don't remove nothing from the library we would have alot of people coming. In the other hand if we removed a certain type of books, people would get mad and not come to the library. If that happens smaller amounts of people will come.      In my personal opinion no item should be removed from the library because many people  have many interesting in many topics in the library. If we remove a certain item from the library then we would loose a certain amount of people. Thats why we should not remove anything from the library to provent the decrease of people coming to the library. Like I said many people have many intersts in many things and they deservie to enjoy them in the library.",0
"Should offensive material be censored?     Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world. Protecting your children from things that offend you, MONTH1 stop them from growing up badly. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there.     Censoring or removing things that you find offensive MONTH1 be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone MONTH1 want to do this. A parent MONTH1 not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. Another reason parents MONTH1 want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. Some parents MONTH1 feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. They also MONTH1 feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly.     Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Parents MONTH1 think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that MONTH1 be considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, ect., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years.     I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people MONTH1 like reading graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. I think people should be able to have a choice.     Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, NUM1's, and burned onto CAPS1, there's no removing it. Books that some MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person MONTH1 lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. Lots of people own these kinds of movies. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?",0

"My dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit. I was nervous in the beginning ofcourse, but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel. I drove all over town completeing some errands we had to do along the way. Now it was time to go through the car wash, my first time in a carwash with me in control. I didnt think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town, but i was wrong. After having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start i had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors. Before i could do all that the wash had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car i rushed to fold the side view mirror and was succesful. Unfortunately due to my slow reaction times i could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and i were all wet and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that wasnt the plan at first. I finally rolled up my window looked at my dad. He looked back at me not saying anything, the car was silent. After our minds finally developed wat happened we broke out in laughter. We had not stoppped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation. All i could say after that was that people go there whole lives without having that type of car wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me!",0

Offensive things should be taken off for many reason that will be explained later on. Things in magazines shoud be appropriate for people to see. The first reason why they should be removed from the shelves is it might be offending to someone important like the president of the ORGANIZATION1 or the CAPS1 of your state.      If the subjects in the reading material are offensive to someone they should say something to defend themselves. If they don't speak up no one will think to change anything.     What I don't understand is why people would let that ridiculous stuff be put in the magazines and music and movies anyway.Even though movies are kind of different. Movies are mostly just made up ideas that people come up with. So if people are offended it is just pretend to begin with.      Offending things in books well the author probably has a reason for it. It might be something that is offending yet people need to know this in case it has to do with someone you know.For example in the Newspaper I read an article about our current president. PERSON1 was being question about his birth certificate. People did not believe that he was born in LOCATION1.      I personally think he was in fact born in the CAPS2.S . But of course they did see his certificate that proved he was a member so that mess should be dropped and forgotton. It was uncalled for to begin with.     I wonder what was going through his head when someone asked him that question. I'm sure someone would have seen it before he even became president.,0

Most reading teacher will have you read a book and then type a essay or a review about your book. Most teacher prefer the essay typed and not written. By the teacher giving that assignment heshe is giving the student the ability to explore out side of always writing. And I believe other students would agree with me, CAPS2 better to type the essay than to write it! Is there a place out there that you really want to know more about, that you hope to someday visit? Well you can always use the computer to find out more about the place. You can use the computer to learn when is the best times to visit that place. CAPS1 if you just heard on the news about a tradjic accident like the eartquake over in LOCATION1, and you want to keep in touch on what is happening in that place you can use the computer. The computer will keep you updated on what is happening there everyday. Im sure almost every person has read a book and came accross a word they did not know or a student had spelling words that they didn't know what the words meant. Well you can use the computer to look up the words.The computer will give you the full deffinition and how to pronance the word. Computers CAPS1 will help you find any information you MONTH1 need, ""AND CAPS3!"" In conclusion computers aren't just a thing that kids play on all day it helps you with many things like getting your work done, finding out about places, and finding out information about things you need to know, ""And CAPS3!""",0
"A CAPS1 Laughter    CAPS2 you hear a child laugh what do you think? Do you think peace and happyness or what do you think? CAPS2 I hear a child laugh I think of my little sister. CAPS2 were outside playing peter pan or inside playing doll's, she just brights up like a light and I can see her happyness. It's not just my sisters laugh that brings me joy it's everyones! I do think a CAPS1 laugh is the most unique though! CAPS2 you hear your child, niece, nephew, or grandchild laugh you should hear there happyness.    A laugh changes CAPS2 you grow older. I remember hearing my sisters and brothers laugh at the simplest things CAPS2 they were younger. But now they never do, now they laugh at sick and disgusting jokes and they laugh CAPS2 someone gets teased. But thats not my case. I am the one who laughs CAPS2 someone does something sill like on americas funiest home videos. But a child laughs CAPS2 you make a funny face or CAPS2 an animal does something funny. They laugh at the littlest things.     To me a smile is just a silent laugh. I remember hearing a saying ""A smile is worth a thousand words"" and I think that goes for laughter too! Even though there is no sound in a smile, there is sound waiting to come out of that person! I know for a fact that CAPS2 I was younger I was abused and so CAPS2 ever something good happened which was hardly ever but I had a huge smile on my face then some one would do something funny and I would try not to laugh but I only lasted like NUM1 seconds, then I would start laughing so hard that I would start to cry!      Theres this one specific time that was the high light of my life. One day I was just hanging out with my sister linda and we were playing dolls. My dad had happened to walk in and he accidently stepped on one of the dolls. Linda started to cry cause the arm had been broken off. But CAPS2 she started to cry my dad started hopping on one foot and held the other then he fell on his butt. I laughed so hard that afternoon! Then later that day he took me and linda to the store to each buy one new doll!     Again I MONTH1 say that a CAPS1 laughter is the most beautiful thing on earth! Just for some reason it heals the soul! You MONTH1 start off on a bad day then you could come home at the end of the day and walk into your house to your child laughing. Then your day gets suddenly better! I wish I were a child again so i could rewind and make things so much better than CAPS2 I was little!      I started off in a bad situation but now I am a smart intelegent young lady! Every laugh is unique in there own way cause every one is different. Just because you grow older doesn't mean your laugh does. But every laugh does change in some way I'm not sure how but it happens as you grow older! You laugh at different things and you laugh not as much as you used to!",0
"In the memory ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author in the memory is very kind. Firsty, he grew up with loving parents. For example it said in the memory that his parents would be excellent cooks that passed it down to him. CAPS2 that they would have the time to teach him and learn. Next, he loved his parent so much. For instance, it says ""I will always be geateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" CAPS1 he didn't love them he woldn't be saying thoughs things. Lastly, he loved his home and was happy with it. For example in the memory it say that ""I would never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

That is why in this memory, the auther shows love and kindness as a mood to this peice.",0
"Hello, I am writing to you today about my concerns about my views on the cencorship in a library.   First, I think some of the music they play and listen to can be a little graphic. I know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others. Music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life.   Second, I would like to talk about some of the books libraries have. I think if they want adult type material they should have a section just for adults. reading sould be about what you like but it should also be about what you are able to read.    Next, I would like to talk about some of the inapropriate magazines that some libraries feature. Some magazines show off a little to much for some of the people that go to the library.Most magazines that are show are for adult and teen over a certain age.I believe they should make a section for each of the ages and age group.   Finally, I would like to get on some of the movies they let people check out. Libraies has a graphic selection of movies that are easily in the reach of young children. Children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all. Libraries need to learn more about there surroundings before they continue what they are doing.   In conclution, I believe that everyone has the right to a library I just feel everyone doesn't have a right to have everything libraries hold. Bad things create bad minds and we have to learn to stay above those influences.Libraries need to change some of there ways and there selections to make things more sucessful on thier behalf",0
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon lusted theres alot of problems when trying to add a dock for dirigibles at the top. One problem or obstacle was the safety of the dirigible itself, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" (NUM1). Another obstacle was nature itself, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (NUM2). The last problem was the existing law aganist airships flying too low over cities or urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (NUM3). These are three reasons why in the excerpt ""The mooring CAPS1"" by marcia Amidon lusted that there were alot of problems when trying to add a dock for drigibles.",0

"Do you believe that certain things need to be taken off the shelf that's uncensored for my children to see.No, I honestly do not because the library shouldn't have no uncensored things put up on the shelves that our children might not see.Cause the staff shouldn't let the children in that area without a parent were the uncensored books, magazines, movies, music and etc.      But it's know ones fault because the media staff that works in the library shoudn't allow the younger kids to go in that area were those things are unless their guardian are with them. Unless they allow them in the area were the books, movies, magazines, etc.The kids should have a certain part of the library were they can take books from that's inappropiate for them.     There's alot of books that children shouldn't be able to read but they read anyways without adults permission.And yes their some books,that's not inappropiate for the little ones and the big kids.Thing's like that is offensive toward the parents how the staff just let them read in see things like that in the parents wonder why, an how there children learning things like that.     Certain things should be posted for things that kids shouldn't be able to see an read and do.And yes I have the right to say something to the staff for letting my child read, see things their not suppose to see.They know those things not appropiate for them so why would they let them watch or do or see stuff like that.     My conclusion yes I think certain things that don't suppose to be were they suppose to be for young children to see.That's not right to let them see things like that. So that's why I'm writing this essay to the newspaper arguing on whats right for allowing them to see uncensored things they are not to see",0

"Seeing one of CAPS15 best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door, was enough to make myself laugh. Its was the DATE1 after CAPS15 NUM1 grade year of school.

"" I down for that ,""PERSON2 said ""CAPS13 me too ,""CAPS9 and PERSON1 replied shortly after PERSON2. As we were walking out CAPS15 front door CAPS15 mom shouted ,""where are CAPS21 boys going?""

""CAPS9 get the last house!"" I shouted at him. The house CAPS9 was running to did not have their porch light on. CAPS9 was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! CAPS9 tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street.  He got up quickly and turn to us in confusion ,""should I ring the door bell? Should I ring it?""  ""CAPS23 run CAPS9 I'm sure they would hear CAPS21 smack their screen door with your face!"" CAPS25 we got back to CAPS15 house everyone was laughing. CAPS9 CAPS23 made our night.

"Why is censorship important in libraries? Why should we care if there is censorship at all? I am here to tell you today my views and opinions on cenership at the library.     When you walk into a library I assume you would expect a public area where you can read books and check them out, but what happends when you browse through these books and you find something offensive? How do you act, and what should you do? In my opinion censorship is alright but only used when needed. Censorship protects childeren and young adults from viewing things that are adult eyes only such as horror books, offensive music, and in most cases pornography. Censorship in the library is an important role because anyone can go into a library and pick up any book, but when you have and adults only section for books, movies, music etc. it stops alot of people to having to worry about there kids seeing bad things. For instance, if tweleve year old PERSON1 goes into a library and finds a video game with large amounts of violence in it he can check it out and play the game without his parents knowledge of the incident. With censorship we eliminate such problems.     Now like I stated before censorship is ok when needed, because censorship can get carried away as well. In reality, its the parents fault of why there kids do things also like letting there kids listen to music with heavy swearing or full access to a personal computer. Things like that are creating problems for parents as well as people around them. When I say censorship is ok when needed I mean people censor important information on the account of a event that has happend in the past. Another example, if your in ninth grade and you enter a library for a CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 movie but its to graphic the student is stranded for a source and must gain access to a computer.     Now that you have my opinions and beleifs you can get a better understanding of what I mean. Censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well. I think that if censorship is controlled correctly it can become a powerful tool in any library, school, and even home. Censorship is at times out of control but maintained we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as country.     In essence, Censorship is ok to and extent and you should beleive this as well just because if you think long enough you too can see what I see.",0

"This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the atire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flower and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that save her the courage she needed to retake her drivers test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return... At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.",0

"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Wind caused a great problem in the docking of the dirigibles ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" (para 6). The swinging of the dirigibles body would cause pulling on the building that the building's current frame wouldn't be able to support. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (para NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building now had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to suit the stress of the dirigibles' loads Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the framing of the mast. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could take place. The workers had to work for another two monts after the building was already complete due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The builders worked hard to suit the new building for the docking of dirigibles. Unfortunately their work was for nothing.",0
"I feel that there should not be censorship in libraries. All offensive material, as much as the more conservative patrons MONTH1 not like it, should stay where they belong, which is in the library for all to read.     I have several reasons I feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some. My biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer. Most works, even the more crude pieces, have some sort of educational value. Without articles based on the less comfortable or more gruesome items of life, people start to only understand in a surrreal sort of way, not understanding how the less fortunate things function or how to avoid them. Those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items, no matter the subject. Allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as in the way it was meant to be used for, a resource for knowledge.     All offensive items a library MONTH1 have stored should stay in that very spot, for learning purposes. No one should be denied the ability to learn just because of the sheilding nature of others.",0

"This year my school and a cop come into my school and tell me and my peers about the dangers of online. This has made me believe that computors are not beneficial. Computors are not beneficial because they enforce bad habits. Plus, websites and some applications are dangerous. Also, they are very addictive. Computors have a bad effect on people. To begin, computors enforce bad habits. For example, some websites are bad websites that say mean things about other people. Some kids MONTH1 join in on the cyber bulling because other kids are kids MONTH1 give in to peer pressure because they want to get accepted by their peers so badly. Furthermore, someone MONTH1 agree to meet someone they don't know. That can be scary because you do not know if this person is really someone you thought they were. Recently, I read a magazine and it had an article in it about people going to meet other people they online. Most people found at that it was not the person they thought they were. Finally, the computor enforces bad habits because people MONTH1 send someone some questionable pictures to someone else. As I mentioned before, when the police officer came to our school he talked about this. He said that people were sending pictures of them that were innapropiate to other people. Those other people would send it around and in the end it was a horrible mess. I'm sure if computers didn't have a giant effect on people, this would not be as big of a problem as it is. Computors do not only cause bad habits, but they are also dangerous. I'm sure if you listen to the news you will hear stories about child predators. I think that is one huge problem. If computers did not have such a on people this would not be a problem. In addition, computors are dangerous because kids MONTH1 choose to make bad decisions because they do not knew. For example, many kids who are on myspace or facebook have not talked to their parent or guardian about internet safety. Or maybe even their parent or guardian isn't monitering them to make sure they are safe online. In conclusion, the computer is dangerous because feelings could be hurt because of myspace, facebook, a blog, a video, or maybe even more. As an illustration, one time one the news I heard a story about a girl who was tensed on the internet. She felt so bad that she committed sucide. I found that horrible. A person should never comitt sucide, especially because some other person could not be nice. To sum up, computors are very dangerous. Computors are also addictive. To start off, it makes you spend less time with your family. (not finished!!!)",0
"hey what book is that lets me see it because I don't think I want you to read it because it is to graphic for a NUM1 year old boy. This is what some parents might say to their child if they don't want them to read a certian kind of book or even a certin book. I feel that censorship is not needed in libraries, because either way the kids will be exposed to something the parents don't want them to see sooner or later      I do not belive that any one has thr rite to remove anything from the shelves except the library. The can go ahead and complain that they dont't want it there. But if the library has it the library should be able to keep it there wheathere or not people don't want it there. I think the only real people that can remove a book for the shelves is the managers or manager if they agree with the patron. Ohter than those certin people I don't think a reagular person can remove anything from the shelves.      At the library i go to they have any kind of book, music, movie, and magazine you want. Wether it is a adult content book to a rated r movie they have anything and they get new things every week. So if a person does not want a certin thing on the shelves they should not be able to by themselves take it from the shelves because what if another person wants to see the movie but they can't because a parent took it from the shelf because they did not want their kid being exposed to it. One time at my library i saw a verbal fight between a patron and the library manager the patron did not want the book in the section it was in because they felt it was to provacative for a childrens book. The manager refused to take it off the shelf becasue the library can have whatever books they want on their shelves.Another time i saw a person break a dvd because they thaught children at the age their children were should not be allowed to see those kinds of movies. But breaking the movie is just putting other people that want to see it put because noe htey can't because it is broken.     To summerize everything I do not think citizens should not be allowed to removeantything from the shelves only the managers of the library should be able to remove anyhting if they want",0

"The Empire State building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles. The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.

"Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first  reason why builders difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety. The helium that filled the balloons was highly flammable. If one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre- existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas. These three main obstacles were face by the builders of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast never became a reality because of these obstacles.",0
"The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about over coming obstacles and is telling the reader to try again. It is important to never give up and to keep trying until you sucede. In the story Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam she really missed it, and on top of it saeng failed her drivers test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying above her and said when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow I will retake my drivers test. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold weather is an obstacle for them. Also her new plant can't grow until its warm. Her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time. You have to keep trying inorder to get around them.",0
Patient are people who been injured in same kind of way and are in the hospital trying or are getting better. I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time so my mom took to the hospital and I got shot. On our way out of the hospital I blacked out and hit my chin on the door so we had to stay their for about an hour. That was the only time that I was in the hospital being a patient.,0

So she is saying that she is going to wait until the time is right to take the test.",0
"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesnt allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then CAPS1 sees it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if CAPS1 doesnt receive water soon CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.

"The builders of the empire state building could not build the moor mast for the dirigibles on top of the building because it is too high and the roof of Empire state building was to flat. Building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cable on top of the building. They design the NUM1 floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers. However it has a lot of problems the building. At first the helium is flammenble so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse. They think greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast is nature because winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air current, so it can pratact from worst accident but it is still not safe.",0
"Laughter is a part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin PERSON1 did not really like each other but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town. After that night we were closer then brothers and there is one huge funny tale behind it. I was really reluctant to even go over there that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun. When I got there we pretty much just watched LOCATION1 in awkward silence. Then his parents informed us that they were going out and that they would not be home until it was very late. About ten minutes after they left my cousin PERSON1 turns to me and says ""you want to do something really fun."" CAPS1 I was at the young age of thirteen years old a could not help but to be interested. So I asked him what this fun thing was and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his field to the wall of blackberry bushes that surrounds his field and he showed me a little path through a certain spot. After we got through the bushes we ended up on a gravel road that led to a house that had a lot of land surrounding it. And on the land were what my cousin identified as fainting goats, I had no idea what fainting goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. PERSON1 walked right up to these goats and made a sudden noise, about a quarter of them just fell over stiffened and unmoving. I was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared. We spent about forty five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less amusing then the first time. The funniest thing by far that happened that night, started off when PERSON1 informed me that he brought an NUM1 firework. We put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it. It went off and the bang that was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity the goats all collapsed and we were doubled up with laughter, that is until the people in the house came out side. We ran like our life's depended on it, we flew down the road through the blackberry path, trough the field and straight into PERSON1's house. We sat down on the couch then we looked at each other, we burst out laughing, my ribs were aching from it, I was light headed with laughter. His parents got home about a minute after we calmed down which we also found extremely funny. As soon as they went to bed we burst into silent giggles. That was one of the funnest times I've had with my cousin and even tough we did not like each other before hand, we ended up becoming brothers in all but blood, but we were cousins so maybe even a little bit by blood but mostly brothers in laughter.",0
"The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memorys of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject.",0
"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is happines. CAPS1 shows happiness by showing CAPS1 wanted nothing more that to be with his family doing the things CAPS1 loved, which CAPS1 did. CAPS1 also shows that CAPS1 is greatful.  ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" CAPS1 feels CAPS1 could never be as ""courageous"" as his parents and CAPS1 thanks them for that, ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think the overall mood of this memoir is joy and happines.There is a flowchart on the bottom of the page, NUM1 columns: one is mood, the other support. Under mood is happy and grateful. Under support for happy is ""like CAPS1 wanted nothing more"". For grateful is written (NUM2).",0
"The mood of the memoir is kind and loving. It showed kindness in paragraph NUM1, what the memoir described how his parents made the whole house feel sweet and nice. He did this by using words like ""innocence"", ""celebrations"", and ""warm home"" to create a the feel of kindness. Love was shown when the author told about the way his parents welcomed anyone of every race to live with them until they ""got back on their feet."" This shows love because when you are welcomed no matter what the problem is or who you are, it deminstrates love to everyone.",0

Narciso says he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him. You can tell his very greatful because of the way he expresses himself about his family. ""In reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spint of generosity impressed upon me, and demonstrate of how important family and friends are"". He is a caring young boy.",0
"One time when I was patient was when I went to camp. I had to wait NUM1 hours till we got to camp. I mostly slept and ate, we also watched movies on PERSON1 CAPS1 player. We finally got their, but I had to wait some  more for registration and I had to wait  till the rain stopped so I could get my stuff in our cabin. Next we waited for chapel to start, but there was more to do there like tennis, volleyball, or sit by the lunch room and talk to friend, or last read in your cabin.  When the  bell rang we all went into the program center and waited  for chapel to end. We had a lot of patients by the end of the week. Ohh at lunch we had to wait for seconds because their food was really good. Finally, I had to wait NUM1 hours on our way back home. This is a time I had patience. (A whole lot of it).",0
"Patience. Patience is something I have absolutly nothing of! I take after my mom in this area. My mom is probably a little bit worse than me but we are both pretty bad. Sometimes we record t.v. shows and watch them later just because we dont want to have to wait through the CAPS1. Some of the other things I hate to wait through are lines, people being late and just plain old waiting around. The longest amount of time I can stay patient for is about five minutes any  longer than that puts me over the edge. On by the way another thing is long car rides when I have nothing to do. I just wish we could have a NUM1 hour drive turn into a NUM1 minute drive but still end up at the same place. I really wish icould have more patience but I dont know how to get it.

"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, obstacles builders faced building a mast for dirigibles to dock there are detailed One obstacle builders faced was how to go about attaching it. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another obstacle would be the accumulated cost of the renevisions due to the first problem. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work."" These obstacles prevented the mast for ever being used its intended purpose.",0

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the motivation and confidence Saeng has after her experience with the plant. there are many reasons and examples that support this. One reason is, he want to show the change in Saeng after he first test and when she boaght the flower to releive her. For example, after she failed the driving test, Saeng goes to the Florist. When she see this plant, he childhood comes back and she forgets her test. This flower motivates her to get her lisence. Another reason is, it shows how confident this experience has made her. For example, after failing, she comes back saying, ... I will take the test again. In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to show how confident Saeng has become over her experience.",0
"Freedom of speech and the freedom of press is a privelige we as CAPS1 are lucky to have. I don't believe in censorship in libraries. Authors, publishers, editors, and directors all have a right to express their opinions in their work. If they would like to express some adult subjects in their work that is their choice. They have a right as people to protray their books, magazeines, and movies anyway they want.      We all have the choice to what books and movies we want to check out at libraries. Movies are required to have ratings so the audience knows the extent of the maturity you must have to watch the film. For example if you are a NUM1 year old who wants to checkout a movie but, it's rated CAPS2 that is not the best choice of movie. It MONTH1 not be the best choice because movies rated CAPS2 let the audience know its for a mature audience over the age of NUM2.      As for books, I often use a book review website that allows me to see the content the book has. If I see that the book contains material I don't wish to read about or think the material is too mature, I don't read it. I hold the power to choose the books I read and the responsibility to choose the books best suited for my age and maturity level.      There are many ways we can track the content of the things we can checkout. Just because a movie or book is released doesn't mean we have to watch or read it. We all make choices in our everyday lives.Some are big and some are small. Picking a book or film to checkout from a library is a small choice, but it is our choice to choose what we can handle.      Author's, directors, and editors should not have their work punished if some people don't agree with the content they are putting in their material. Everyone's opinion varies on what's right and wrong. Therefore if you believe something is inappropriate you have the chocie of not reading or watching it.      I do believe we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech. Although we shouldn't abuse it we must not forget we have no right to tell others how to use this freedom. As we have the choice to read what we want to, authors have a choice on what they want to write about. Libraries shouldn't take away this freedom that allows us to make our own decisions on what we view or read",0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story there are some quotes to support my response I-I failed the test Saeng said. This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by planting vetagables, and fruits.",0
"I personaly disagree with the experts who are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. The reason why I disagree is because it not the computers folt people don't get out and exercise. Buying a computer and getting on the computer is free will and the computer dosen't you get on it that's our choice so we can't blame the computer for people not excerising. Another important thing to remember is that computers are important is because they help you get more educated. For example there are computer class online for people that want to there degree in different fields, with just a click of a button you it can change you future and career for the rest of you life. The most important reason is because it help people learn about different cultures and ways of life. I love learning about LOCATION1 and LOCATION2 even through they had that terriable storm. I thank you for listening to my opinon and I hope that it change's your point of living a life without computers",0

"I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship.     A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the PERSON1 books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it.     Music shouldn't be censored. Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. Each generation has it's own style and music, has it's own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves.     Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so childern can watch them. If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it.     Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. People deserve to know what's going on. People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefor making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them.     You can't please everyone, so just elt us make our own decisions. Censoring our libraries is like censoring us. We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? They can't keep us dumb by hiding things. We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin",0

"There were many obstacles workers face when building the Empire State Building: making the structure of the tallest in the world, making it serve a greater purpose than being just a building and most of all it had to be stable.Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the CAPS2 for architect Al Smith, his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler building was originally only NUM1 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun.When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph NUM3), he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of ORGANIZATION3 below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, NUM4 feet taller then the Chrysler Building.The CAPS1 CAPS2 that the building seems to face was the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds. Most of the building was weather proof, the only problem being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at it's base. Lined with steel, th structure still holds today. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they set out to build. And it is still the tallest in the world to this day.",0

"Katherine Paterson stated this quote, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' CAPS1 I agree . I feel that some of the books we have in our ORGANIZATION1 libraries today just shouldn't be there. Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines can give  students and young children the wrong impact on life or their envoirment around them.     Now days, what children see is sometime what they do, so if books, music, movies, and magazines give them the idea that what they say or do is cool, then kids will most likely do it. CAPS2 observation when i look at kids  in CAPS2 community playing  is that they follow one another . When their playing tag and hide an go seek , So movies, books , music, and magazines play a big part on the way they behave.     CAPS2 own experience with offensive books would be, there are books that are made by PERSON3. In these books they use curel language, use wonmen bodyparts as symbols and many more rude things. CAPS2 little sister came across one of these books, when she ask me about it was hard for me to explain to her that this was no book for a child her age to be reading, So the best way for me to put it was that it was an adult book. For her to get any images out of her head that I felt she shound't have.     Another experience I've saw was with CAPS2 little cousin PERSON2. He was looking at a magazine out of ORGANIZATION1 library. The magazine was offensive to wonmen. It was a play boy bunny magazine. Now I don't know if you ever heard of these magazine , but I think it is very wrong that they use wonmen bodys for men to view . I also feel that  those type of magazines should not be in a ORGANIZATION1 library. I believe it gives children, mainly  young men the wrong thoughts about wonmen.     CAPS2 overall thoughts on censorship in libraries, is that not eveyone is going to feel the same way I do . There are parents that allow their children to read, listen , and watch whatever they want. I'm here to say i don't feel that is the way to go about things , because it can influence your children to do inappropriate things . I hope you take with you, CAPS2 personal experience with you and help you children read , listen , and watch age appropriate books , music , moives , and magazines",0
"The idea of docking dirigables on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one It seems as though the dream of dirigable transportation was on it's way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al CAPS1 competitive nature not only pushed the building to a un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, And effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed by the late 1930's the idea of dirigables a top the Empire State Building had disappeared.",0

"What is consitered offensive? If we took books, music, movies and magazines that people found offensive of shelfs there would be nothing left. Everyone is diffrent which mean they all get offended in diffrent ways. By taking all this off shelfs we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world.          Things we learn about in school, slavery, wars and some pollitics. Now all these things could offend many people but if we were to take them of off the shelfs at school and libraries children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world. What about drugs and alchol, many parents do not talk to their childern about the uses of controlled substances, so without these sources they MONTH1 never know the harm that they can do to someones body. Everyone takes something offensive but not everyone takes the same thing offensive. So who is to say what offends people and what does not? If thats the case shouldn't we take all books, movies, music and magazines away from childrens schools and libraries? Adults get offended to so would we take all of their resources away also including the newspaper. By taking away what one MONTH1 call offensive MONTH1 land us in the dark ages with no books, no local news, no movies, no nothing because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive.   Everyone has the right to read and write what they want. No one can say what offends everyone. Someone MONTH1 get offended by talking about ones race, another MONTH1 get offended by talking about CAPS1 and someone MONTH1 even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat.

"though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect becuase, they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and ORGANIZATION1. Students keep their essays, study guides, and home work updates on files in the CAPS5. Offices would not be able to function CAPS8 computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interviews with a student from ORGANIZATION1 says, ""I use my CAPS5 for everything; I would not survive the workload CAPS8 CAPS3."" CAPS2 asked why, he replied, ""CAPS3 keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics."" A lawyer said, ""You can not support a client if you don't have the right tools, and a CAPS5 is on MONEY1 those tools."" CAPS4, CAPS8 computers offices would crumble and students grades would drop. Could you imagine writing a newspaper CAPS8 a CAPS5? Secondly internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as 'CAPS6' and 'CAPS7' allow people to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. PERCENT1 MONEY1 the nation owns accounts on socializing websites, and PERCENT2 MONEY1 the nation says their friend groups have expanded to the groups (according to a poll taken). A psychologist explains, ""Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; online bloom."" CAPS8 internet, citizens MONEY1 LOCATION1 would know little about other countries' people. My next reason, however is even greater. Lastly, CAPS8 internet, people would do for less traveling. Internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination. CAPS3 also is an easy and effective way MONEY1 booking where the tourist shall stay. Apoll taken by ORGANIZATION2 airports shows that PERCENT3 MONEY1 the travelers book their flights online and CAPS8 online ticketing 'the wait to book your flights would be unbearabley long; or stop travelers completely' (quote from a worker). My people and I went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed NUM1 people each. We inquired about how the bought their tickets and PERCENT4 MONEY1 them said online. ""CAPS9 do you mean, how? On the internet MONEY1 course! no one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!"" said a person interviewed. Airports make MONEY1 for the LOCATION2 government, and CAPS8 internet less people would travel. There for, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners; since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing and better ways MONEY1 booking transportation. CAPS8 computers internet access, our business would crumble, then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me.",0
"Computers are a vital source for anyone's household. Many people have busy lives and having a computer at home make it easer. You can use it for research, organization, and business matters. I dont know what I would do without one. Education is very important especially in our economy today. The computer makes work and studying fast and simple. When you need to research a topc for school there is always an endless library of information CAPS6 you turn on the computer. You CAPS7 get your information from books, and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time, to get to a local library.

"In the essay Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lames mule, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he cant make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says sometimes life can be so cruel as he notices the speed limit to be NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesnt believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation should please all sadists reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling.",0
"Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people doesn't like them, and finds them offensive is simply not fair.  A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy.                 A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think.  Simply regulating books, and other products, by creating age limits based on the books content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves.  Take an author like PERSON1 for example.  His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people.  That being said censoring the books language wouldn't help in the slightest. If a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like PERSON1 then they would have no problem making inferences on what matierial was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized.                  The other fact is that taking out mature level books completley from the libraries is not a possible solution either. If you take out the diversity in your product your going to lose the diversity in your customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were CAPS1 and CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie.                   So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever. Were all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality.",0
"Did you know that libraries contain books, movies, music, magazines, etc.? Yes ! They have it all, if you ever need something for research or a project just go there. But if there is something that you do not like, just keep going.           I do not think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I think that if it is something that offends you then you should just keep going. That 'something' that might offend you, could be helpful to others.          So, now you know if you ever see something that you don't like in the library just walk away. It could be helpful to you and others. If things offend you, how would the next person learn? They won't. Don't only think about your self, think about others in the situation also.",0

We were babysitting twin four-months old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when her baby, PERSON3, spit up on her too.

The weight of the mast would make the framework crumble, so the builders had to modifie and strengthen the steel frame of the empire state building. Secondly, most foreign dirigibles were highly flamable making it highly dangerous for on two moor overapopulated New York city. Also nature itself was a problem. The winds at the top of the building were just so strong it'd be dangerous to moor there. And finally, the law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas.

"CAPS2 people have computers, and CAPS2 people use them. It's been brought to my attension that the government is worried about people using them to much. Well I think you can't use a computer too much. They offer so CAPS2 things such as information, communication, and life skills. That doesn't too bad. Informaiton is something we as humans live for. Also in CAPS2 schools and jobs you need to know a variaty of unusual facts. Where can you learn these? Computers of course! When PERSON1 (my teacher) gives us a research paper on walt disney, we use computers to find our information. With out the computer, I wouldn't know walt disney died before disney world opened. That clearly shows one of the CAPS2 things we need computers for. Communication is another aspect of our lives. With a computer you can have MONEY1 ways to comunicate. Yes some of these way can be dangerous but, CAPS2 are safe. When I was in NUM1 grade my teacher ms.casserelle set up a classwide email for us. This allowed us to email another school.

"In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles in the attemp to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the greatest obstacle was one of safety.

An accident where the German dirigible caught fire and was destroyed, shocked the builders, but they realized it could have been worse. Nature itself was also a problem.

"In the ninth grade I was required to give a speech about a book. The speech was to be persuasive, like a television or radio advertisement. I am awful at giving speeches. Before speeches my hands get clammy and cold, I experience ""hot flashes,"" and occasionally get nauseous. During speeches my eyes frantically glance around the room, my breathing pattern changes to quick short breathes. Almost in sync with my glances. At the end of my speeches I begin shaking and am nearly in a state of shock. I do not speak, I do not laugh, and I feel like hiding. Luckily, CAPS4 speech was different. My CAPS1 class had all girls and one boy. Not to say I am sexist, but having the majority of the room being female did help. Girls have a way of acceptance, or at least creating a facade of acceptance, and that does make me feel relaxed and calmer.  So when the time came for me to stand up in front of the room nearly everyone in the class had a slight smile of ambition and readiness to listen to what I had to say. Everyone was making eye contact with me. Compared to the average classroom setting of ""speech giving time,"" (when people are doodling or mouthing words to each other) the classroom was zoned in on me. Today CAPS5 felt like everyone was ready to hear me no matter what I really had to say, and how professional CAPS5 came out. I felt superior, as if I had the power to alter their lives, almost so superior that I could spit propaganda at them and they would eat CAPS5 up (CAPS2't that what advertisment is? Telling a group of people the good things about a product or idea, and hiding the bad things?). The group looked so innocent. Today I was ready to give my speech, just because of that spark of acceptance, and a smile. I began. My speech was told with puppets with a cardboard box around CAPS5 to serve the purpose of a television. CAPS4 also made me feel better because all the audience saw was my puppets and all they heard was the voices of the ""actors."" CAPS3 the first few lines of the speech my group of classroom peers laughed, CAPS4 was not what they had expected. I am a shy, quiet girl who barely has the courage to raise her hand in class. I wear things like semi-large coats to set a barrier between myself and the world. A lot of times when I give speeches people laugh, but usually a negative laugh. The kind of laugh that the teacher has to hush everyone. CAPS5's also the kind of laugh that makes me cut my speech shorter, that just makes the speech a introduction and an ending, bodiless. So for me to break out of my shell was a big step in what most think of as the correct direction. The sound of CAPS4 laughter coaxed me to continue forward with my speech.  At the end of my speech everyone clapped. They always clap. CAPS5 is required to clap. CAPS4 clap was different, CAPS5 was clapping for the success of the speaker, a clap that said ""CAPS4 speech had a clear purpose, and made the audience want to keep listening."" CAPS5 was not a pity clap. Then I smiled. My smile represented that I knew I had succeeded. That I had gotten a group of people together and focused on hearing what I had to say, and that they had comprehended CAPS5, and maybe that they would now want to read the book. CAPS4 was one of the first speeches I had ever met all of the requirements on. The length of the speech was good, not long enough to make the audience fall asleep and not quick enough for them to forget the true purpose of the speech. I enunciated all of my words so everyone could understand what I was saying, CAPS4 was a definite improvement, and also a factor of why they laughed. They could hear my witty jokes and comments. Lastly, my puppets also had a introduction, body, and conclusion to their babble. Usually I get so nervous I forget to say the body of the speech. Laughter can be mean, cruel and disrespectful. My speech story is an example of how laughter can effect people positively. The laughter of the audience was cheery, happy, encouraging, and accepting.",0
In the memoir the author made a certain mood. The mood he made was loving and very alive. He constructed the mood of love in paragraph NUM1 where he talks about the memories of his house always filled with comforting aroma of food and the passionate cuban music playing.  It also where he talks about how the memory of his home having the congregation of family and friends as the back drop of their warm home. Another example of the mood of love is in paragraph NUM2 where he talks about how he was always surrounded by love ones during meals. He constructed mood of life in paragraph NUM2 as well because he talks of how his house always became a sanctuary to his extended family member who lived with them until they got back on their feet. This gives the mood a sense of life because of all the people who have lived there. In conclusion this is the mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir.,0

"Do you believe that certain books, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelf in a library due to censorship? There are many times when you hear a parent tell their child not to look at that magazine because they don't want them to see the vulgar things on the inside. I've heard parents tell their children not to ever watch that movie because it'll show things that they don't need to be seeing. Almost every day we're put in situations like these, not knowing whether we should pick up the magazine or just leave it on the shelf. In my opinion, I believe that libraries should remove anything vulgar from the shelves. Kids are encouraged to go to the library as much as possible, but not if there is vulgar things on the shelves.     Kids are told many times a week by their parents, teachers, and other adults to go the library. They can work on their homework, read a book, or do some studying for school. When they get distracted from finding the book they want with a book that has vulgar things in it, they're going to be curious. The main reason I disagree with having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children. The last thing they need to be looking at is something that isn't appropriate for their age. It's hard for a child to turn down a movie or magazine they've never seen or looked at before.     In most libraries the adult section is seperated from the childrens section. This doesn't mean that a child can't over hear something that the adults are listening to or watching. The childrens section is made for fairytale stories and kid movies, but when the adult section has things going on over there that aren't the most appropriate then kids can over hear. If children and adults are going to be in the same library then I think they should make it completely impossible for children to veer over there and see what's new on that side of the library.     Another reason I think libraries should censor themselves more is because of teenages in the community. After school hours, a lot of teenagers in our community enjoy going to the library. If this is such a good environment for teenagers to be then why are they able to download bad music off of the internet?      Some teenagers listen to bad music with cursing, vulgar language, and much more. Libraries should make it impossible for teenagers to do this. If they want to download bad music then they need to do it somewhere else where youngers can't get ahold of any of it.      My last argument for this is a heads up for the parents. Parents should check out what stuff their kids are looking at when they go to the library. You might not think your child would look at something with vulgar things, but sometimes, they're curious. All children are and it's human nature to be curious. I, myself, would go with my child a few times just to see what's in the library and tell them not to take things off the shelves that look bad.      Some libraries can't completely fix everything. They can't take every bad or vulgar thing off of the shelves. In the quote it says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.', I can think of books and magazines that I  would never want any child to look at, especially at a young age. Libraries need to be more interested in taking vulgar things off the shelves so that younger children cannot get ahold of. It's one thing for a child to see a book or magazine that isn't necessarily appropriate, but in a library it's a completely different story",0
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph NUM1 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", the first line says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. The wind would blow the dirigible off the mast into New York City. In paragraph NUM2 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", a line states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in such and urban area like New York. One final obstacle is safety precautions. In paragraph NUM3 a line states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" If a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster. Violent winds, laws, and safety precautions are all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast.",0

CAPS2 thinking I know that computer have a positive effect on CAPS10 three arguments is that computers give you ability to learn about faraway places, allow you to talk online with other people, and help you with school work. Please take CAPS10 side and think that computers have a positive effects on human society.",0
"books, music, movies, magazine, ect. shouldnt be taken off the shelves simply because they are offensive or because children can get their hands on them and repeat what they have read, seen, or herd. they should stay only because these so called 'offensive' objects that we have obtained can teach us very useful things such as what to do and what not to do and teaches us about our history or another countrys history. it is true there are some things in a library that children shouldnt see yet but whats to stop them from taking a look anyway? there are people who crave this offensive knowldge but are told time and time again they are not old or mature enough to handle such things but in more ways than one and it has been proven that some people thrive better with the true that holds violence than it being hidden from them. without these things children will never know what is really going on in the world around them and will be too shocked to do anything if they end up in the middle of something dangeroius and without the correct knowledg on how to handle it or where to go. that is exactly why the offensive things should stay in the library.",0
"The builders of the Empire State building had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was placing the mooring mast on the building. Lüsted states, ""The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof"" (Lüsted NUM1). This meant that they would have to build another structure to be able to place the mooring mast. The second obstacle they faced was preparing the building to dock dirigibles. Lüsted claims, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top... held by a single tether would add stress to the buildings frame (Lüsted NUM1). The dirigibles would weigh the building down so they would have to find a way to prevent damaging the building. The architect would have ""The steelframe modified and strengthed"" in order for any dirigible to dock there. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock.",0
The author was in a respectful mood. In the memoir it tells a lot about how his parents took care of him and about his life and how his parents heped him through it. So when the author wrote this he was in a somewhat happy mood because he looked back on all the good times but that can also make you sad too.,0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast of the building. They first had to do modify this top as a mooring mast and the steel frame of the building had to be modified to accomadate the dirigible. They also had to make a docking and ticketing area, which also costed money. They also had the problem if the dirigible hit something or caught fire by its hydrogen gas. Nature itself was the biggest problem because near the building, winds were violent. There also was a law stating that dirigibles or airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. If the shell broke, the dirigible could hurt many people.",0
"CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye cordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye cordination when people don't even realize CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. PERSON3, a NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport."" Hand-eye cordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed NUM2 people and NUM3 of these people say that hand-eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you comunicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcoms aim, facebook and many more. CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on LOCATION1 and her sister, PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a youtube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. PERSON2, a NUM4 CAPS3 teacher at LOCATION2, says, ""CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees."" CAPS5 is true, about PERCENT1 of the homework of NUM5 graders is online, whether CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' expierement or a paparatzi's take on PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand-eye cordination, being able to talk your friends, and being able to learn the computer benefits society.",0
"The mood created by the author is a warm and meaningfull adviroment. They made there house have a Cuban feel to it. They have passionate Cuban music playing, and aromas from the kitchen. Anyone who needs to stay at a place, stays there. His parents moved here and left everything  behind them, friends, family, and jobs. His mom and dad taught him that family and friends are the most important thing in your life. He said he learned the real meaning of family in his house and he says I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.",0
"The material that someone people believe shouln't be viewed by childern, I don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason.     The library is not just for the children but also for the adults. Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while their out in public. So why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them? I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves. By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library.     Another reason i don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them. Their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read. Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things. If everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library. Their only custmors left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being.     There are always ways to make both side of the situatation fair. I just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do.",0
"CAPS1 you MONTH1 know, CAPS2 people are starting to buy and own computers. Some experts say this is a bad thing and that we should spend more time outdoors. I disagree with this statement. First, computers help us with every day life. We check news on computers, some people even use their computers CAPS1 a CAPS3 and watch important shows. Second, a computer is a great way to comunicate. CAPS10 its friends, family or even buisness, a computer is a excelent way of communication. finally, a computer is help when it comes to school or work. You could write a paper on the computer for example read on to see how I support my reasons of why computers are helpful in peoples lives. Have you ever had a time when you see something on the news that you want to learn more about? Well, CAPS10 you had a computer, you could go online to the news website and read more. This is only one way a computer comes in handy in every day life, there are plenty more. Another way is CAPS10 you don't own a CAPS3, you could watch your favorite show on the computer. My english teacher PERSON1 says ""I never owned a CAPS3, I only watch CAPS3 on my computer and I like it better"" In fact PERCENT1 of people who watch videos on the computer like it better than CAPS3. This is how computers come in handy in every day life. I love how computers have CAPS2 ways of comunicating. I like it because I have CAPS2 relatives who live far away and I use my computer to comunicate with them from time to time. Skype is my favorite, I can see the person CAPS8 talking to at the same time. Also computers can be good for business for large companies who need to comunicate out of the contry. I'm sure being a amazing newspaper company, you could use a way of easy comunication. finally, comunication with friends. These are CAPS2 programs for this, CAPS9 CAPS1 facebook and myspace. This is why a computer is a good way of comunication. finally, computers can be useful for schools and work. You can type a paper or news article on the computer. It's much faster than writing. Also, CAPS10 you need more info on something, you could look it up online. like CAPS10 you are writing an article on dolphins, you could learn more about them. In conclusion I think computers are good things. They help with everyday life, They are good for comunication. And last they help at school or work.",0
"The mood created by the author is happy. A sense of security with friends families and neighbors. His parents sacrificed there careers and leave behind friends and family basically starting there life over for the benifit of their children.

The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems and obstacles while attempting to allow blimps to dock there. One of their obstacles was that foreign blimps used hydrogen Not helium to stay in the air. If it blew up over New York the damage and death rate would be catastrophic. A second obstacle that they faced was that the elevation of the building was CAPS1 high that there were strong wind currents. Making it difficult for the Navy's blimp the Los Angeles to come CAPS2 the docking station at the mooring mast. Their final obstacle that they faced was the fear of the blimps going CAPS2 another buildings Spire bursting a hole in the blimp: causing it to crash.The builders faced many obstacles such as the danger and high risk of a foreign blimp trying to dock and ends up blowing up since They are filled with hydrogen and not helium. Also since it is at such a high elevation the heavy wind currents make it difficult for the blimps to get close enough to be able to dock. Finally the fear of the blimp going CAPS2 another buildings Spire puncturing a hole in the blimp causing it to crash.,0
"NUM1 out of NUM2 of the students and staff members of CAPS3 CAPS4 school find computers verry important. Computers not only help people in school but at home too. I know that the readers of this artical will agree that computers are verry helpful, they teach us about people and things far away, and they are great for chating online! Most people use compoters every day! Computers are verry helpful tools in every day life. They always have a program that if you spell something wrong it corrects you. Computers even have websites of a dictionary were people can look up words. I know this is verry helpful because my brother is writing his collige essays and their are no colliges that will be impressed by a gramaticly incorrect essay. Computers also help you find things you need really fast, like food restrants and the closest malls, or even jobs! Not only do computers help people with spelling and jobs but they also can teach us about far away places. Computers can show and tell us of wonderful places beond what we have scean. A lot of normal societys familys have been on vacation before. To find an intriging place to go they can look it up on the world wide web. Even if a family cant go on a vacation they can still find from their computer cheeper closer things to do. When computers are beig used to find places and thing across the world and near you is they can also give teens the oppritunity to chat with their friends online. A lot of students in CAPS3 hallow school have a facebook account. Most use this account to talk to their friends online. I also have a facebook and I use it almost everyday to talk to my cousin from LOCATION1 that I havent scean sence I was NUM3. But, computers arent just used for fun chating they can also be used for school blogs. In my language arts class we have a reading blog that every student has to participate in. This blog allows the class to not wast class time to talk about recently read books. In conclusion computers should be taken seriosly because they do help society. Computers help us every day, they teach us and they can be verry fun and eductional. Remember what PERSON1 from the department of tecnolgey at ORGANIZATION1 said, ""CAPS5 can only get better if socitey accepts it.""",0
The mood of this memoir is a good one. It describes how a house is not the same as a home (last sentence in memoir) and how family is more than just blood relatives.,0
"The content in todays materials are not always subtible for young children. Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games. By growing up in a violent enviornment, children observe and have the greater chance at becoming violent. The continuence of censorship in todays materials are a necessity to the well being of the children in todays society.     In video games there are ratings that help explain wat is subtible for each age throughout childhood and adolesence. Movies are also the same, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be. Age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games in todays world, and some of the influence it brings on children is unecessary and eventually detrimental to their well being.     The reason ratings should be changed is because children obsorb their enviornment and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they have a greater chance in becoming violent children. In libraries there are sections for every age group, specific genre of books, fiction, and non fiction. But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children. As a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary.     Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in todays music, radios do a good job in editing content in songs, by puting parental advisory on certain cd's, but this still does not stop them from buying the material. In games including, CAPS1 of CAPS2, NUM1, etc. teens are now becoming accostumed to this type of behavior, that is not safe nor condusive for children.     By censoring certain material it disallows the continuence of bad behavior amongst our youth today",0

Man this is so hard to be patient .But its not good  to be  in patient .I wish people were as fast is  I am during a test .Then I wouldnt have to be very patient.O well I guess Im just going to deal with it man this really stinks being so patient.",0
"Each year the world becomes more and more advance in technology. Technology helps and benefits us all in a good positive way. Computers are apart of this positive technology and definetely benefits society. Computers help us look up places and things we never seen before and teaches us about them, too. In addition, computers have a positive impact on families and benefits them greatly. Also, they help people from adults years out of college to teenagers in high school communicate with their friends. Therefore, computers help us all in some little way and makes life easier and more fun. To begin with computers helps us expand our knowledge. It us helps us look up facts or recent news quickly. For example, just recently the DATE1 CAPS1 occured and they usualy go late into the night so I didn't get to see the whole competition. I could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which medals. computers helped me by looking up the medals quick so I woudn't have to wonder who won a medals not. Computers help us expand our knowledge all the time. They help us look up facts for report, places we want to travel to, learn about the benefits of a certain pet and the posibilities can be endless. to continue with, computers help families by bringing them closer in a way. A family member could be watching a funny on youtube or ORGANIZATION1 and could think its so funny that they want their whole family to see it you. In addition, stores sell clothes online now so mother and daugther can sit down together and shop without leaving the house. Computers bring my family together by we rent movies from LOCATION1 on the computer. It brings us together when choose and pick which movie to rent. Also, it brings us together to have a family movie night. As a result, these things the computer gives brings out discussion in the family and gives a good topic that everyone can relate to and talk about. Another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together. There are many ways communicate on the computer these days. There is facebook, twitter, email, aim, and many more. They are all different, but they have one thing in common is to bring old friends and new friends together. For instance my mom just sign on to be in facebook so she can talk to all her old friends from highschool and she found one really good friends who she hasn't seen in ages it made her really happy. Therefore, it shows that computers aren't just for bringing new people together, old ones, too.",0

"CAPS1 people are talking about computers and what it does to us. People believe that using the computer is a waste of time. I believe that computers aren't a bad thing. Using the computers can help us learn about other places in the world. It can also show us the lives about people from the past. We can also talk to our friends online. If you want to know why computers are useful, just keep on reading. People say that computers waste our lives. I disagree with that opinion. The internet is a great way to learn about different places in the world. We can learn about the climate. The animals, and the food they eat. CAPS1 palces have different types of culture. For example, in LOCATION3 everyone eats seafood. In LOCATION2, everyone eats spicy food. The internet can show us pictures of beautiful places that we have never seen before. It's a great way to see and learn about different places compared to how you live. Do you have a friend that you haven't seen in a long time? Would you like to be in contact with that person again? Well the internet is a great way to do this. It allows you to make an account such as twitter, facebook, NUM1 and more. You can search up your friends name and magic! You finally have the chance to talk to your old pal again. You would be thrilled to be able to talk with them again. CAPS1 kids use the computer in order to do their history projects. Well the internet is here to help. You can search up famous people from the past or people from now adays. The internet allows you to see and learn about these people's past. One example is LOCATION1. He was the first president of the ORGANIZATION1. You can learn so much about him like where he was born, how CAPS1 family relatives did he have and more. So you see, the internet is a great use for kids. These are my reasons in why I believe that computers aren't bad. We still have time for family, friends and any fun outdoor activity. We can learn about different places in the world. We can talk to friends online, and we can learn about people from the past.",0

"I believe that there are many books in a library that should not be avalible to everybody that goes into a public library. Yes there are some very offincive items in a library, such as a book about racism to african americans. No, that person who takes offince in those itmes does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all. The library is open to any and or everybody.      Lets suppose you have a young child, and you take himher to the public library with you. As your looking for a book the child reaches to the highest book that heshe can reach, pulls it off the shelf and it lands on the floor open. You look down to see what had happened and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right infront of your child. Thats your own fault, not the librarys.     Although many times its not the librarys fault where certain books are at, you should be more responsible and check out the area in which you are looking.      I think there should be a select area for which the 'inappropriate material' should be kept. And for a person to get into the select area they must show a membership type of identification, and sign a waver saying the material they have checked out will cause no trouble nor take offince to anybody in which the customer is around.     And that is my view on this subject.",0
"I think computers are great. There really helpful. They can teach us about things. Also they have fun games and websites which is always a plus. Computers are helpful in lots of things, like if you need to look something up for school you can just easily go on the computer and find it also some teachers have websites now where insted of bringing a big social studies book home, you can go on the internet and use the online book. Did you know that PERCENT1 of CAPS1 students rather use the internet book then taking the actual one home. Also if you forgot to write down your homework theres a website to lookup all the homework you have. Also computers can teach us things. There are websites that have math games and school related things. Also you can easilly go on google and look up things and they can give you thousands of information. Lastly the internet is a good source for fun they have millions of games on the internet and also fun websites like facebook. Did you know PERCENT2 of CAPS1 students use the computer for the games and online talking. This also gives kids lots of things to do on a rainy day. So weither your using the internet for it's helpfulness its resources, or just for the fun games and websites. Computers are really helpful.",0
"The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First of all, the cyclist says hes in Lodi, California on a gorgeous day in June. Its very hot in California in June, so the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke. Also, he is in the middle of the desert , where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path a large snake that are possible poisonous in the way. That puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal, or run out of water with no place to go get more ! So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist.",0
"Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty. A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages. A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views. A library where works of literature such as ORGANIZATION1, To CAPS1 a CAPS2, and PERSON1 are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology.     A number of children in the LOCATION1 are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the LOCATION1. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that MONTH1 interest a child. Children are PERCENT1 more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as 'CAPS3 CAPS4' is unpractical and harmful to the child. By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want.     Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they MONTH1 not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. LOCATION2 was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought.  Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? This freedom should apply to books. No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read. And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries. No one should be denied the chance to learn.  By censoring books in libraries throughout LOCATION2, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn.     We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology.  However, books are an important part of one's education. Censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are supressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the CAPS3 CAPS4 series. These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft. However a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library.    Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive bys everyday. The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in. Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish.",0

Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasnt. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldnt have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. Its easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to consider the stress of the building, and adding more to the top of the building would increase the stress. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to meet the needs. Also it would be over MONEY1' worth of modifications. The builders also faced the obstacle of safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is flammable, so it wouldn't be safe. ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" There was also a law that was in their way. Facing all these obstacles, caused the builders to not go through with this idea.",0
"There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable, would cause stress for the building's frame to be stressed. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating.One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing. The back of the ship would move around  the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed.",0

"Based on the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author in the memoir could be described in many ways. To begin with, the boy is very so grateful for his parents and adore them so much. And paragraph two it states, ""the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)""

"Library Censorship     Everyone has their favorite book. But if it offended someone, should he be allowed to remove it? Offensive materials should not be removed from shelves. If we removed books that offended even one person, then no books would remain.     As americans, we have the right to freedom of speech. Authors use their freedom in their writing, just like musicians use their freedom to make music. But if we denied them their right to put out their creations, we would be denying them their basic rights as an american citizen.      Personally, I hate rap. I don't even consider it to be music, due to the fact that no one actually sings. But I do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it. Should I be allowed to remove it from shelves, leaving teenagers without their music, denying artists' freedom of speech, and ultimately, leaving them unemployed?     One of my favorite series is the PERSON2 series, by PERSON1. It is about a young teenager who learns to deal with all the struggles of growning up by depending on CAPS1, and it helped me do the same. But because it is a CAPS2 series, should it be removed from shelves? Should other young girls be denied the chance to read this life-changing series, simply because someone might find it offensive?     Although some wish they could elimate certain materials that they find offensive, it isn't fair to the authors, musicians, or fans of those pieces of work. However, those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it. Libraries need to make sure they separate each topic distinctly, so people can easily tell where they should or shouldn't avoid. Libraries are suppost to be a resource for everyone, which means they need to have materials for everyone, even though they might seem offensive.",0
"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The man who came up with the plan was Al Smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. Which this would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. But with this came lots of work. And they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to make plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast. In the story it says ""Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows.""",0

"A time that I had to be patient was at cedar point in LOCATION1. My CAPS1, my sister, and a friend were spending the night at cedar point.

After about six hours, my sister and I went on all but NUM1 or NUM2 of the roller coasters, my CAPS1 by the way, am not really like roller coasters, being old and all, so it really was just my sister and I. So after all the fun my sister and my CAPS1 were going to back to the moterhome, but I wanted to go on just on??? before heading back, so I asked if could ask she said yes. I told my CAPS1 that I would be back in hopefully a half hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest roller coaster by the park. As I waited in line, I felt like it would take forever.

"In all of our lives there is that one person that is so special you would never do anything to hurt them. Whether that person be a close friend, a significant other, or a family member. The people that are involved in our lives significantly are there to help us through the rough patches, bring us up when we are down, and be there for us. Friends are one of the most important people we have in life. Friends are someone we can talk to and they understand, someone we share everything with including clothes, food, etc. They are the ones that get us through each day with a smile. High school is filled with drama, it's the same old story just, a different day. I have the best group of friends, we are very close and spend a lot of time with each other at school and outside of school. They are there for me when I need them the most. Recently this guy, PERSON1 and I have been trying to work on our relationship but he had been lying to me and cheating on me but everyone of my friends that I talk to abut the situation say the same thing, ""he is going to hurt you"" and ""he's not worth your tears."" I have class with him every other day. It's not like I get to choose when I want and don't want to see him, some days are just better than others. The bell rang, right after lunch, and I wasn't in any hurry to get to the band room. The band room is very big, smells like old cheese and is like a trampoline for sound to bounce off of and explode in your face. I don't enjoy that class at all. I walked in the room nonchalantly and set all my books on my chair and began walking to my cubby. I grabbed my instrument walked back to set it on my chair and went to talk with some of my friends. It hadn't been a bad day so far, it was just a regular day at school. Entering the band room I had a feeling that DATE1 was different. He walked through the band door with a huge smile on his face but I couldn't help but look away and frown. Mixed emotions are the worst, he does one thing and you love him and he does another thing that drives you insane and makes you want to hurt him. He sits right behind me in band and I am constantly turning around to talk to him but we never seem to get in trouble except for DATE1, we were supposedly talking to much. I don't believe we were talking to much, because DATE1 was where I wanted nothing to do with him. He was upset with me and I was upset with him, so we were even. Twenty-five minutes passed by, each minute dragging on longer and all I was thinking about was him and what I had heard he was doing. It's never a good feeling when you know something is wrong. I confronted him about what people were telling me. His response was ""don't believe what you hear, believe what you see."" I didn't know what was going on, but tears started pouring out of my eyes, running down my face like a crystal clear waterfall. I asked my teacher if i could take a minute out in the hall, and she agreed, so I sat in the hall, with tears running down my face. One of my friends walked out the door and sat with me to comfort me. We started talking and I told her everything that was going on. She gave me a hug, and start making jokes about him. I couldn't help but laugh. I even smiled and made my own remarks that got her to laugh as well. After a few jokes, and a bunch of hugs, the tears went away and I was smiling. Neither of us wanted to go back in class but we didn't really have any other options. We weren't very close friends, but our talk during class, made us grow stronger. Even when everything is going wrong, you should count on your friends to tell you the truth, and give their advice, because they are always right so don't second guess them. They know how to make you feel better and it always seems to work. Laughter is much more than an emotion. It gives you strength when you are weak. It builds you up when you are down. Laughter brings relationships closer, and sometimes all we need is to smile. Laughter also helps create memories, the nights you stay up talking and laughing until two in the morning are the ones you will remember forever. Laughter is an important aspect to everyone, we all need a day to just relax and take a step back to laugh.",0
"I CAPS3't you agree that computers benefit society? I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you MONTH1 not beleive computers are "" Society friendly"" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( CAPS6 CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your CAPS8. scanned through channels and say ""CAPS9 goods on CAPS8?"" CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool watch. You could pull up your CAPS12 browser and go on CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast NUM1 million videos on CAPS13 and NUM2 being watcheduploded per day. Infact the ""CAPS14"" views NUM3+ video a day without noticing CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""CAPS15 CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, CAPS17 stating those two things, CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big testreport due tomorrow, you can study for CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the ORGANIZATION1 and the company ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I beleive the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should beleive that the computer is society benefitcial.

"To whom it MONTH1 concern,     Censorship is an issue that has plagued our society for centuries. It is not only unnecessary, but unconstitutional. As CAPS1, we have certain ORGANIZATION1 that we are guarenteed by the documents that keep our society out of anarchy. If the right to pick what liturature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, where will that put our country? Censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today.     In the CAPS2, the CAPS3, and the ORGANIZATION1, we are given certain ORGANIZATION1. Some of these ORGANIZATION1, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been contricted, which is 'wrong' in the eyes of the government, but nevertheless, it is taking place. We MONTH1 not have 'lost' these ORGANIZATION1, but they have definitely been constricted. Why should the government be able to tell us what to read? If censorship is allowed, what is to come is frightening. If our government, which is supposed to be 'for the people' tells us what we can read and not read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat?     Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues. There are countless examples on why censorship of written liturature should not be allowed. For instance, if a college student is writting a research paper about the effects of rape on a child, but the government sees rape as 'too graphic', what is this student to do? He or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fully-informed paper. But by censoring our libraries, and taking books out, the government is hindering the education of it's countries youth.     Some CAPS4 classics are also being speculated against. The CAPS5 of PERSON2 has been known as a classic since it was written. It is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for education. But recently, the availability of the book has been questioned. Throughout the novel, the 'n-word' is used, but never as an insult. During the time-period of its writing, this word was more common, and had a much less severe meaning than it does in modern day societies. But because time has changed it's meaning, it is being removed from libraries and curriculums across the country. This is unlawful censorship. One of the greatest books of our time, an CAPS4 classic, is being removed from the lives of our youth because of 'racy language'.     Censorship is not only taking place in written liturature. Movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship. Movies are rated for a reason, to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate. This is helpful to parents to be able to self-censor their children. But it is not up the the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view. It is a parents right to be able to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of our country's lawmakers.     Music is one of the biggest part of our society today. With the invention of iPods and NUM1 devices, music has become much more common, and portable. Censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style. The music styles of modern teenagers greatly differs from that of their grandparents. Almost nothing is seen as unacceptable by many of today's rappers, as displayed in their choice of lyrics. The music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular. With the most common themes of sex, drugs, and money, it MONTH1 seem offensive to some citizens, but others MONTH1 just shrug it off as a normalcy. So how can someone say 'No, you MONTH1 not listen to that,'? This should not be allowed, yet it is.     How can one person, or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not? They cannot. Censorship is morally wrong, as well as lawfully wrong. Taking the media from its citizens, such as books, movies, and music, is unconstitutional. What would our forefathers think of what censorship has become? Before you pull that 'unacceptable' book off the shelf, remember the ORGANIZATION1 of our great countries citizens, and the ORGANIZATION1 of individuals like yourself.

NUM2 out of NUM3 CAPS5 have said they are their CAPS5 are spending to each time on the computer. CAPS5 need to realize that sitting on a computer CAPS4 is a danger to their health you don't want you CAPS5 to have eye problems in the do you?

"CAPS1 you know, the majority of people now posses computers. Computers have greatly advanced society and technology. Some people say that computers have negative effects, but that is not true. Computers have influenced people in many benificial ways. Although some experts want people to use computers less, that technology is required in schools. Kids are fold to type their papers, which lets them finish faster. This faster finish can lead to kids not staying up too late. Then doing homework. That is better for their health. Computers also develop hand-eye coordination which is an essential skill for later in life. In my opinion computers have greatly contributed to technology. They are letting explore place human has evercould ever go. We can make and distribute item much faster. In addition, computers also let people learn about faraway places about different cultures and different people. Computers can expand everyone's horizons and let them know about places and things that they never knew existed. With are of the largest number of members. Facebook is a website that people use to communicate. More than PERCENT1 of most students in an average school have one. They communicate there more than they could without computers. Computers aren't making people ""anti social"" or making them interact with friends less, they're actually talking more. Computers are letting people communicate daily with people from all around, without having to wory about running out of cellphone minutes. Overall, computers are letting people broaden their horizons are lock of new things. They are more of a benefit than a burden. Computers are the next best thing since sliced bread.",0
"Architects for the Empire State Building faced many problems trying install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues to get around landing a dirigible or blimp on the building. People in a populated area such as New York City, is not the safest place to land a blimp, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as dowtown New York."" They could not take this risk. So, the competion for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings. This is why landing blimps on the Empire State building would be dangerous and difficult.",0

"Censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools. There MONTH1 be  a book that someone really wants to read, and they cannot get it in their school's library. A lot of books that are great educational books have been taken off of the shelves of libraries, because they are either too violent, or they have bad language in them.

There have been a lot of books, teachers view as being educational books, that have been taken off of the shelves in libraries. Books that teachers would like to give to there class to read.

"I believe that everyone should be free to read, listen or watch what they choose to. Anything publically exposed is goin to be seen anyhow.

People read ORGANIZATION1 material to entertain themselves, and there is nothing wrong with entertainment. Everyone loves entertainment but to put a limit on it is unfair.

If its there to read then let it be read instead of hiding it from them it only makes children more anxious to read or see it.        If its in a public library let it be read people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless other wise consented by a parent. anything publically exposed in a book, magazine or movie will be shown on the internet or tv so children will see what they want  rather elders' agree to it or not.

So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life. As we sit in talked she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion I really felt like I had patience and since that day forward I have sat down and let people tell me about their problems.,0
"One time my volleyball team went to ORGANIZATION1. I was one of the last people off our bus which means I was one of the last to order. I stayed there very patiently as everyone ordered. I talked to my friends as they waited too. Next I figured out, what I was going to eat, (CAPS1 cheese, burger, CAPS2 fry, and a large drink). CAPS3 CAPS4, CAPS3 CAPS4 as I watched the clock my eyes got droppy CAPS7, NUM1 the lady said. CAPS8 MONTH1 I take your order, she said. I told her what I wanted and she put it on her register and I began to wait. A couple minutes later I got my order. Finally after being patient I got my food. That was the time I was patient at ORGANIZATION1s???",0
"The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting hes placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a ghost town where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesnt really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. Its June in California and the cyclist fears he MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesnt find water yet. It doesnt help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosent find water.",0
"Take it CAPS1?          How do you take it when people come out with magazines, movies, or music that is extremely offensive to you? How can you stop your children or the younger generation from watching these things? The truth is we can not stop them, their is so much of the pornography and bad music out in this world that your can get it anywhere. It is all over the internet and you can't control that.     If I find something very offensive in a store or online I should have the right to voice my opinion, and that opinion should be taken seriously. They shouldn't have inappropiate things in public stores or places children can go. That is not right and it is setting a terrible example for the kids. Some people should just know better and take it CAPS1.     Almost every day that i go online, i see something on the side of the website advertising some kinda of pornograghy site. Its unbelievible how that is allowed on public websites for everyone to see. If they're going to continue to do this, CAPS2 needs to be some law saying they can not on public sites. I see things of half naked ladies on the side of the website and i know thats not okay for young kids to be seeing at those ages.     I understand a lot of things in this world is about money and people make money by selling things to others. Selling movies, magazines, and music saying or doing things that are rebelious is easy money for opper teens and older people. They can still make good money if they were to make funny stuff instead of pornography things, everyone loves to watch, read, or listening to something funny.     So basicly we aren't going to stop this completely and you all should know that. the best thing we can do is protest it and hope that it will start fading from the public some day. It should die down eventually. We can only hope for the best",0

"I belive that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from public libraries. What if a young child were to stumble across an innapropriate magazine.. They would have the images stuck in their heads and could lead to unlawful decisions.     There are many books and movies that aren't appropriate for most young aged children. I think that they should either be placed more appropriatly or removed completely. Some people will take certain materials to be more offensive than others, but if read, the person might get angry or start to have bad thoughts.     Personally, I think that most fictional books are intertainment only. They do not display actual happenings or thoughts for the most part. If someone reads them as offensive, they might just be taking it the wrong way.      Most Libraries have areas sectioned of for adults only but they aren't monitored. So how would anyone know if a child was in this restricted area where they shouldn't be viewing this material? They wouldn't have the slightest clue.     I think that in today's society, most children already know about sexual graphics and whatnot, so why limit them to what they already know about? There are a lot of television shows and movies in the world that are much more graphic that books and magazines. Shouldn't they be banned too?     The world is exposed to offensive material everyday. We just get used to all of it and do not take it the wrong way. But young children don't know better, so there is no gaurentee that they won't take ideas from inaprpropriate viewings and use them. So maybe things do need to be taken off shelves.",0
"Based on the expert, builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building was never thought of an easy task to accomplish. As it was mentioned in the article the idea of the dirigible was ""destined to never fulfill its purposes."" One obstacle in which builders would face is safety. Since most of the dirigibles from outside U.S.A uses hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. This is a very dangerous obstacle to builders because fire itself is really dangerous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, however. If the winds are shifting violently, the dirigibles could be way down and be dangling high above the pedestrians. This would not be safe to the people or the builders because it could hurt them. Another obstacle builders would face is that there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. It would make illegal for a ship to ever tie up or get close to the area. This made it harder for builders to accomplish because it's against the law.",0

"Marcia Amidon Lüsted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock dirigibles NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards.",0

"In this memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso talks about how his family made his house a home. The mood he sets throughout the memoir is love, selflessness, and gratefullnes. This memoir shows love because of paragraph NUM1, Rodriguez reminisces, ""countless extended family members came and went--and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even if they weren't blood related, they still consider themselves family and cared for each other beyond belief. This memoir also has the mood of selflessness because Rodriguez says that they moved selflessly, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved and ended up facing many hardships to their new country. The last mood shown in this memoir is gratefullness. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful for his cooking abilities, his love for cuban music and for his parents love and sacrifice. Especially he is grateful for how his parents turned his simple house into a home.",0

Also the computor is a good souce of entertainment. You can play a number of games off the internet. You can even down load consal games onto your computor. Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of CAPS3 shows and movies like if you wer fallewing a telivison selles and you missed an episode you can just go look it up.

The Problems CAPS1 face with Building dirigibles to dock there was a lack of Suitable land area and the mooring mast could not Be Simply Drop on the empire state Building flat roof and on top of that A dirigible A thousand feet up held By a cable tether would add a lot of stress to the CAPS2 frame the stress of the dirigible load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the CAPS2 foundation. And the other Reason was a safety Reason most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen which is highly flammable.,0
"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to have dirigibles dock there. First off, it was a huge safety issue; ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flamible"" (paragraph NUM1) if an accident happened (lets say to the magnitude of the Hindenburg) over New York City, thousands of people could die because of this highly flamible substance. Secondly a very large problem was to successfully use the mooring mast. ""The winds at the top of the building work constantly shifting due to air currents"" (paragraph NUM2). If the wind was out of controll and the dirigible wasn't tied down right, the harsh winds could be dangerously dangeling over the people of New York. Amongst many other reasons and the use of common sense, it is clear that the construction of this mooring mast should never have ever been thought of as a reality.",0

"Many obstacles presented themselves while builders attempted to build a landing dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The obstacles included the publics safety, CAPS1 that were already put in place, and the unpredictable weather.Many dirigibles use hydrogen gas which is very flammable.

At the time there were also CAPS1 forbidding aircrafts from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing dock was too low. The final problem was the unpredictable weather.

"Comics, romance, adventure books, and mystery books are just the few different types of books out there as well as the magazines and music we listen to. With a little bit of everything, and whatever your passion is, we have that right in our local libraries to go look at or hear whatever pleases us but, some of the people that go there are not adults. Some of them are young children who are either checking out a book themselves or are simply with there parentguardian. I believe that even though there are some books magazines, and music not attended for children, they still shouldn't be removed just because they are found offensive.     Everyone once in their life had to atleast experience something unpleasant. But knowing our world today, we simply can not hide from those things but yet face them, we adults are old enough to just walk away from something we find offensive unlike what our children or other children can do. Sometimes, even children have to go through it as well. It's part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us.      If you already know what parts of the library have stuff children shouldn't see, don't bring your child to that area. And if it's possible, bring them to an area where they MONTH1 sit and read there favorite books as well with you by there side where you can watch there every move. And at the same time, you don't have to take a chance at explaining something that you are not quite ready or sure that your child is ready to hear or see.      Since it's impossible to hide things from your children that you are not wanting them to see and hear at the same time, that's a part of life. Even if they are still really young and ask what a certain thing is, we can simply turn there heads and make them get distracted by something else and pretend that we didn't hear what they said. But as your children get older, they should know right from wrong and know what things they MONTH1 read and things they can't.     Some of us are oblivious to the world around us and MONTH1 not know that certain things can cause more harm than good, even like taking your children to the library. If you don't like a certain thing there or know that there is going to be something you simply do not want your child to see or hear, then don't bother taking them with you on your next visit and go another time when your child is with a babysitter or take a chance into bringing them with you an expect the unexpected when it comes to offensive items at the library",0

I do not think that people should not be able to take books off of the shelves.     For example if there is a person of the jewish religion they might find a book about hitler offensive. In that sense if they take the book off of the shelf then the other kids that are soon to come into the age of studying this era will not have a book to look at. Without these books our history of the world will be soon forgotten.     Another example would be slavery. I believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with. In the reality it was a hard time for the africans. I do not think that they will take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive. How could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation.      If we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries what do we do about the bible. Some people do not believe that there is a god or a heaven, but a lot of other people do believe in it. So how would that work out in the long run? it would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well.      In reading books as a kid i have found that some things are bad and i do not like them, but i dont believe that we should take the book away from people that like the books.How do you take away from the people that like to read different nopvels than you is beyond me, but it will only be a problematic subject in the future.                                                  this is an essay by PERSON1",0
"Computers have helped us in many ways. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs and computers have helped law enforcement as well.

Children can use their computer to re-search homework they're doing or even just research thing for fun. Most adults have been through school and are educated but computers help them make discoveries about space, the human body, etc. So not only are computers teaching children, but they're part of making new discoveries that need to be taught to children.

"She ends it with that statement to show that she is ready to relive spring in the new country now that she is comforted by the hibiscus. The test is adapting to the new country and she failed it she believes because she had to be comforted by her native plants, but she believes that she will pass the test next year because every repetition of the season allow her to become  more adapted to the new culture. When she says when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.All those things tell her its a new year and makes it easier to accept whats happening.",0
"The mood this memoir created was a warm greatful feeling, with his praising for his parents and saying how much he loves his tiny home in his hometown and how greatful he is for his parent's selflessness.",0
"In the setting the young man is faced  by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person. For example he was proud of himself he mad himself happy by saying at the end ""yes sir! I own a very good map"". He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supplie of water to get to where he was determined to be Yosemite.",0
"If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be thats from your old country and in your knew one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house Many times in the story you could always hear that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore thats why he concluded the story as such.",0
"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, its adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example,  in lines NUM1 Saengs thoughts are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saengs eyes now and swept over her and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept. This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because its gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said  and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. It means that she will overcome all that and move on.",0
"Have you ever picked up a book, video, or music from the self and wondered why is this here, it's not a well thing for our younger kids to read, watch or listen to. I think that we should pluck out these types of books on our shelf at our libaray to better our community for our kids and their kids. We have all the right to voice our opion on things that we think should and shouldn't be in our libaray. Books that promote sexual activity, killing people, using or taking drugs, and other harmful things, which isn't the best for our kids to read, listen to, or watch should be removed from our libaray shelf.     Have you ever noticed how are crime rate and drug rate has went up in the past few years? These types promotes are in some of our books, videos, and other media. If we remove the videos, books, and other media that promote this kindof behavior we would have less of this type of crimes going on. I don't believe we would have all this crimes going on if we would remove this type of media because we all have a person we want to be like in a song or tv show or even in a book so we follow what they do, if they promote crime you try to act like them. We as humans follow the actions of others weither we think about it or not.     Music also plays a big roll in this to, music containing bad laguage or promoting someone to take drugs or kill people, has been proven to play with our minds. Would you as a parent want to see your kid raised up in a community that promotes sex, drugs, kill people, and other things that we shouldn't do? There's music we all like out there, we listen to what we like so that being, if we like rap for explain, if it promotes killing we are more likely to follow that action in the song because your mind thinks it's self out of it being a crime to kill cause you like rap music so it must be okay.     We CAPS1's in our community believe that we should abstian our selfs from this kindof behavior and we don't see to many drugs, killings, or sexual activity. The bilbe teaches us to stay away from things that promote drugs, killing, or sexual activiy, thus we don't see much of these behavoirs in a CAPS2 home or community. CAPS4 are more better off then lot's of us weither we want to aceppt that or not. They live a life after CAPS3, which don't promote all these behavoirs. and I know that CAPS4 would be more willing to take out these type of media in our libaray. You can sit for one whole day and watch the actions of CAPS4 and how they act they don't act like normal people as far as into drugs and stuff like that, only because they abstain their selfs from media that promotes sex, killing, and drugs.     Now, if you want to help us make our community a better place for your kids and their kids, let's remove the harmful media in our libaray that promotes sex, drugs, and killing. I don't think you would want to see your kid doing drugs or killing people and messing up their lifes because you didn't help in removing this media. Please help us better our community for our kids and their kids and the genrations to come after us.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a multitude of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the building frame had to be strengthened. The weight of ""the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that the building's frame had to be modified, which costed NUM1 dollars. Next, it proved to dangerous to dock dirigibles to the sumputous sky-scraper. After the Hindenburg caught fire, ""the owners of the ORGANIZATION2 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" In accordance with this danger, there was a lot existing at the time which prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly, the largest obstacle engineers try to overcome was simply nature itself. Winds at the top of the building made dirigibles almost impossible to land. Both the Columbia and the Los Angeles tried to dock to the mast but could not battle the wind. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building could not get a dirigible to dock at their tower.",0
"To whom CAPS5 MONTH1 concern, CAPS1 the joy of just clicking a mouse and all of the sudden you are talking with a friend you haven't seen in years. Computers make this a reality for us, but that isn't the only benefit they offer. Computers help society by providing us with search engines and educational resources allowing us to connect easily with friends and family, helping us communicate importances and plan things and a lot more. First, computers have become a vital part of education and research a like. Students at schools, elementary through college, are able to connect with much more information than without computers. You can even earn a college degree on the computer! That's right online universities are beginning to form. This is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children. Also, computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals. New discoveries have advanced with the help of computers that will actually help people's lives! Computers are used to search for a cure to cancer disasters such as earthquakes, and even help see a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to occur! Computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago. Secondly, computers allow people to connect and reconnect with other people around the CAPS2. I recently got a facebook account, and within a few days I had found and to three friends of mine that had moved away a distant cousin who had moved to LOCATION1 that i haven't seen since we was little and even my great grandmother! The possibilities are endless. Email has also been very beneficial to society as well, as CAPS5 helps people communicate and plan events, which brings me to my next topic. Lastly, computers help the CAPS2 communicate with one another. the internet is filled with websites made to benefit our CAPS2, one being ORGANIZATION2; CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4. If not for computers this program wouldn't have been as succesful and beneficial as CAPS5 has become. Also, is an amazing website that combines education with the aspect of CAPS2 CAPS5 quizzes you on different levels of general knowledge and for each correct answer, ORGANIZATION1 donates NUM1 grains of ORGANIZATION1. When i am bored i sometimes go on, and so for i have filled over thirty bowls of ORGANIZATION1, while learning at the same time! To conlude, computers have proven to benefit the CAPS2 and all in CAPS5, not only people but the environment, too. Computers help advance research, help people reconnect with one another, and help the CAPS2 communicate, Who knows that computers will help us accomplish next?",0
"the obstacles the builders of the empire state CAPS1 face. was that their expanded use in LOCATION1 was the lack of a suitable landing erea. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state Building.A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passangers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast.",0
"One time that l was patient was when we went to LOCATION1 CAPS1. We had to wait in line for an half an hour. We were supposed to get on the cork screw ride. I was very excited to go on that ride. So I decided to be patient. So for NUM1 min once we got to the front of the line l couldn't wait. So I hurried up and got on then ride. I really didn't like that day when l had to stand up that long. But, that what patience means.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph NUM1, the excerpt tells the reader of a huge issue. It states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame."" Due to this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Another set back is in paragraph NUM2. It states, ""The greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" Due to violent air current, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Tethering the mooring mast would do little help. Lead weights could not be used. In paragraph NUM2, it states, ""dangling weights high above pedestrians..., was neighter practical nor safe."" All of these obstacles showed architects, the project at that time was impossible.",0
"I believe that computers are a great and fun tool. But I also believe people can spend to much time on them. The computer is excellent. People can use them to type papers or reports, makes graphs, and other important things for us. Schools are using computers more and more now. Schools have websites for students to go to findout there homework, classwork, projects, reports, and extracredit. The school has even started doing something very new, allowing parents and kids to check the students grade online. Not only do the schools help students, but also everyday people help as well. if a student has a project but doesn't know how to start it then he or she can google there project and ways to start it. Computers can be real great and easy to use as you can see, for schoolwork. Computers are not only great for academic purposes, but also for leisure purposes. Before computers and internet, there were only these ways to have fun during boring times in the day. One was watching tv, reading a book, or going outside, if you could. What do I mean by that last sentence? If you lived in a city, then it would be harder to go outside because maybe you lived in an apartment or somewhere not a comunity. Then you couldn't go out; and reading books can become boring after a while, and maybe there was nothing on tv for you to watch. But when computers and internet cameout, people sould play games, watch videos, and talk to cousins or family who live far away. Computers are also good for social networks. Not all familys live close, but are a close family. But in this ec onomy we can't always afford to visit them whenever. So by using computers we can CAPS1 them facebook them, ,myspace them, and even video chat with them, which as I said is great far away family. But at times people can become to obsesed with them. Some people spend all day on one website, particulary facebook or youtube. Do not get me wrong, these websites are fun and cool. But not cool enough to not go outside and have free, natural fun. I remember I logged into facebook and saw a girl on, I logged off around an hour later and she was still on, then I logged in again around TIME1 and the same girl was on! That is just to long to be on one website. Computer are a great tool for humans to use for business, education, and leisure. But to much is not good.",0
"There are more than six billion people in the world. That means there are over six billion different personalities and opinons of all these distinct people. It would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive, because almost everyone is offended by something. Some media can be found more offensive than others, but its likely that its something that the author feels passionate about and the author could be offended if his opinon was rejected. Now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world. Media that used to only be found on the shelves is now displayed online, which can never be permanently removed from public view. It's illogical to think that just removing materials from libraries would prevent different groups of people from being offended by the media.     There is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness. Some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type a culture and raise awareness about the subject. However, there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe. So, it is in those authors best interest to take into account the people they are writing about. It's important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful. There is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational. If a person is offended by something someone wrote, they should just avoid reading it. However, this does not give authors the power to target a group in their writing and offend them specifically.      This is a very two-sided subject. It can not strictly be controlled by censoring libraries; it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere. Authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending. In regards to this, readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them, and avoid conflict by avoiding the material. It is not right by any means to target and offend a group of people in a piece of literature; however, this is a practice that has been done before and just remvoing the materials from the shelves won't stop it from being exploited.      Libraries are already decreasing severly in their reveleance in the world. All the new technology has hurt them and its not likely that they will ever become more prominent than other reasources, like the internet, again.With this in mind, how much would censoring libraries really help those offended groups in the world? Most likely, they would not even notice a change. Everyone has the right to have an opinon and share it, but it is important to keep the feelings of others in mind as well. The world is overflowing with different media that many people have access to, so writers and producers need to think outside of themselves before putting it on the shelves.",0
"I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, I could drop from heatstroke.

"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles include the weather, safety, previous dirigible tragety, and the law.The wind at the top of the Empire State building was a huge safty hazard because even if the dirigible was secured the back would swing a cause a potential hazzard due to the unpredictable winds. To fly a dirigible they are filled with hydrogen instead of helium, this is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May, 6, 1937 the hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, LOCATION3, so the owners took into consideration this could have been much worse if the accident had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Dirigibles are very unsafe so this created many obsticles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigible to dock there.",0

""CAPS5, CAPS4"" CAPS6 CAPS4 are the people who will be putting the CAPS11 wrap across the street.

""CAPS7 sounds fun, but uh what happens when the CAPS15 stops before the CAPS11 wrap and takes it down?"" CAPS8 CAPS9, looking down on the whole operation.  PERSON1 laughs a little bit and CAPS8 ""CAPS10 then it will be an inconvenience for the driver."" CAPS11 wrapping roadways sounded a lot for fun then black ops so we were all down.

I hang up the phone, tell the guys and DATE3 up from the ground. We all get over the fence in quick time and start a first layer of CAPS11 wrap. I get another call. It's CAPS14 saying that there are three cars are almost to our location. We drop the CAPS11 wrap in the bush and get back over the fence. The CAPS15 comes up close and it's a cop. Of course. We all just stay hidden down in the bushes while the cop takes our huge roll of wrap. We are only left with one more roll , which should before enough.  CAPS9 calls again and CAPS8 it's clear. We go out again and start to set up the prank. We wrap it around NUM1 times and make it as tight as it possibly could be. Perfect.  ""CAPS15 incoming! Go! Go! Go!"" yells mark while trying to get over the fence. We all make it over in time and go prone in the field. Laying there anxiously someone whispers ""here it comes.""  The CAPS15 slams on it's breaks, and the driver gets out. He looks at CAPS11 wrap in disgust and looks around for the kids responsible. CAPS9 lets out a big ""hahaha"" from the roof that even we can hear perfectly. The guy walks up the fence looks around a bit more and mutters for foul words under his breath. He didn't even bother continuing through, he just got in his CAPS15 and backed up.""CAPS16 my god dude that was hilarious!"" I say with a wide grin on my NUM2 CAPS9 and PERSON3 come dashing through the field with a scared expression on all of their faces.""CAPS18!"" yells CAPS19 scurried into different directions.

Do you want to be the one sitting on a coputer all day getting fat or do you wan't to be physically fit while getting exercise. The only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers. So you should be getiting off your lazy bum, bum and getting some good old exercise. Yes computers teach you things, but exercise teaches you you things while you are getting fit. Who wouldn't want to see the beauty of nature. Yes you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a bunch of pixels mushed together. In the real world it is all natural and sometimes more beautiful than on the computer. How doesn't that sound better than the computer. All of the cool, fit people are outside enjoying nature, so be one of the cool people and go outside and have yourself a ban looking at exotic plants and beautiful animals.

"In order to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, many changes had to made. The builders and planners both faced many obstacles. First of all, to even consider the idea, they had to ""consult with experts"" which meant taking tours and doing research. They had to find a ""safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" The next obstacle is in paragraph NUM1. Docking a dirigible to the building would put ""stress"" on the building's frame. The builders had to ""modify and strengthen"" the frame. One of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower. The builders eventually decided on a rocket shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm. They had to house the machinery to winch the derigible, too. Overall, the builders had to make drastic changes, spend a lot of money, all for something that wasn't even safe in the end.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many natural oposition in attempting to allow derigibles to dock in the building. Nature forces were a total threat to the idea of the dirigibles landing on the Empire State building: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which wouldn't be safe for the people getting in and off the dirigible because the ship would swivel around and around the morning mast. Other oposition to the idea was that most dirigibles that came from outside the U.S didn't use helium, but hydrogen which is highly flamable and risked the life of the people who lived around the Empire State building. Also the law was against this idea. There was a law that prohibet airships to fly too low over the urban areas. This law made the docking of the ships in the Empire State building illegal. The builders of the Empire State building confronted both natural and social oposition to the landing of the ships in the Empire State building.",0
"Everyone is CAPS1          CAPS2 person is CAPS1, this much we can agree on. So why then would people try to put a censorship on books, movies, magazines, and etc., as i pointed out before, we all are CAPS1 so we all have CAPS1 standards on what is bad and offensive to what is good.     When we remove a book from a library shelve for whatever reason we have to do so then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. If  picked up a book on why CAPS3 is the right religion and i am a CAPS4 then more then likely i will find it offensive. Yet if i gave that same book to a CAPS3, that person would mostly likely read that exact same book that the CAPS4 read and find it not offensive at all. It all comes down to the veiws we all have about everything so why would you let one person or even a small comittee set standards on library censorship for they MONTH1 feel one way while another comittee or person feels completly CAPS1. Everyone is CAPS1 and feels diferently about issuses. There is no way to make sure that CAPS2 book in the library won't offend a single person.     The same issue can be applied to music, movies, magnazines and ect. No matter what we do, some one will be offended. For example, the plege of allegiance is something my school says everyday, yet some people, like a ORGANIZATION1, find it offensive. All acrosss the nation people say it before school, a sportinh game, or ect., yet you don't see very many people objecting to that. I have obsereved that most people who find it offensive just ignore it so why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines, and etc. that we MONTH1 find offensive.     In conclusion, there really is no way to put a cencorship in libraries since no matter to tell what a person might or will find offensive. So why then can't we just not read what offends us, this really is the only way to keep from offending  people. For these reasons, I feel that there should not be a cencorship in libraries",0
"In building the Empire State Building, builders had to deal with numerous obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was what the dirigibles would attach to. Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking. After failed attempts at docking the idea went away, and builders realized the plan would never work.",0
"The mood in the memoir is happyness, and friendship, and glory, an example is ""My parents always always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. A feeling of friendship and honesty is ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, where clearly in need."" and that is the mood of the memoir.",0
The mood of This memoir is positive and careing. The reason why this story is caring is because they CAPS1 all the people stay there and they aid them until those people could move. And the reason why this story is positive is because The parents are always having fun cooking cause that's their favorite thing to do and their always haven fun CAPS2 those are the mood that is in this momoir,0
The setting of the place was ghost town as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldnt ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.,0
"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders ran into a few obstacles. One obstacle was a previously existing law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. Another problem the builders ran into was high winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing in the wind, making it unsafe for passengers unloading. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Another safety issue was most balloons outside the United States filled dirigibles with hydrogen which is much more flammable than helium. Dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a disaster if it ever caught on fire. Although the idea seemed great at first, the builders at the Empire State Building realized it was not practical or safe.",0
"I met my best friend PERSON2 when we were in kindergarten. At the time we were both shy, and we looked to one another for comfort. Little did we know the acquaintances we made with each other would soon blossom into a wonderful friendship full of good memories, and plenty of laughter. Last DATE1, my family took a trip to my grandparents' house in LOCATION1, LOCATION3. My grandparents usually only used the house once a year in the DATE2, so while they were home in LOCATION4 my parents decided to take advantage of the empty house. Both of my siblings are in their twenties and are busy with college, so my parents invited PERSON2 to attend. We were so excited, for this was our first time to LOCATION3 together. PERSON2 and I had many activities planned and I couldn't wait to show her around ORGANIZATION1 (LOCATION1 PERSON1). The only downside of the trip was that we would be driving, we would be in the car for about NUM1 hours. I had known this since we used to go to ORGANIZATION1 a lot when I was little so I brought along a notebook that we could draw in and write in. By the time we got to ORGANIZATION1 that notebook had been filled from cover to cover with drawings and funny sayings that PERSON2 and I had quoted each other for. PERSON2 and I have an odd kind of humor, we think everything is funny when were together. It can be the most ridiculous thing and we will burst out laughing and no one will know why.  Finally, a good NUM1 hours later we arrived in LOCATION2, it was late though and we had to unpack, therefore I wouldn't be showing PERSON2 around until the next day. That didn't mean our night wasn't exciting, in the backyard of the house there is a pool house, and in order to keep someone at the home when no one is there my grandparents rent out the pool house. My parents had known that a man named CAPS1 lived in the pool house. None of us had met him, only heard stories from when my brother lived in the main house when he attended college in ORGANIZATION1. That night my mom asked me to go get my dad from the back yard because dinner was ready, it was dark outside so I made PERSON2 come with me. When we got outside we saw my dad had introduced himself to CAPS1. CAPS1 looked exactly how I imagined him, he had on red shorts, no shoes and a peach colored t-shirt. He had sandy blond hair and was pretty scruffy, he looked like a big beach bum. CAPS1 quickly made his way over to me and PERSON2 and introduced himself. He was pretty nice and very goofy. Throughout our whole conversation PERSON2 and I couldn't keep straight faces.CAPS1 said that he had to go so he wanted to teach us a handshake that he made up. He stuck his hand out and curled his index, ring, and middle finger so that they were in towards his palm and the only remaining fingers sticking out were his pinky and thumb. He gestured us to do the same thing. We all did as he told us and stuck our hands in the center of where we were standing and he tapped his pinky and thumb against our pinkies and thumbs, he said good evening and ran back to the pool house. It was very odd, but so funny that my dad, PERSON2 and I still do this on occasion.  The next day, I took PERSON2 downtown, and showed her around. When we were on our way back we stopped inside a craft store, that I, nor PERSON2 had ever been in. When we walked in it looked like any other average craft store, but as we explored a little more we noticed there was a huge section of armor and helmets that CAPS3 soldiers wore. Us being big dorks decided that we had to put them on, so we put on the helmets and armor and stood by the windows in the front shop and waved at people. The ladies working in the craft shop were laughing at us and it had us laughing at ourselves too. We fell down from laughing so hard, at this point the people who were working were not laughing anymore they were mad that we had fallen while wearing the armor. They came over and told us to take it off and that we needed to leave. We did what they told us to do. By the end of the trip we had made so many memories, and we couldn't wait to return the following year. In my opinion laughter is very important in relationships, it is healthy and it means that sometimes you don't need words to express how you feel. This DATE1 PERSON2 and I will be returning to LOCATION1 PERSON1 and are looking forward to many new memories and laughs that we will share.",0
"The features of the selling effect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. Also, because of this factor, hes pobably suffering from lack of water. Hes probably really hot seeing hes the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles. Another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there MONTH1 be a car around this next turn. If he cant see around the next turn he doesnt know is coming. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up.",0
"In the passage winter Hibiscus by monfong Ho, the quote  when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again, it symbolizes CAPS1 new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland CAPS2 she states I  failed the test. This test meant more to then she just failing. She was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The  when they came back quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again.",0
"Certain books, magazines, music and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library. Children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. There are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music. Often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics.     Libraries need to take control of this issue the right way. Getting rid of the material is not what should be done. Libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library. They could do this by not letting children leave their parents side. That way parents can know and control what their children are seeing.     Then there is the issue of offending people. These problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library. These sign could be in big bold letters stating 'Certain things in this section can be offending', 'CAPS1 control needed past this point'. Libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. Libraries should put them selves in the publics shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children. Also, looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems.     Once when I was in a library I was offended by a book title that was against my religion. After seeing that I thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me I would not of had to see that. Other things like this have occured in a library like one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of. But with the way the libraries are set up and controled my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents. Other children like my brother could do the same things only worse like look at an inappropiate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve.     These types of occurances need to stop before something really bad happens. Libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner. Actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright. Putting up signs and requiring CAPS1 control can reduce if not elliminate these unapproved occurances",0
"CAPS1't you agree that more and more people use computers. Well I CAPS2 because it gives us the information we want to see. Recently it has been brought to my attention that some people agree that some people CAPS3 themselves don't really use computers. Without a dout I firmly believe that people that dont use computers should start to use them. but I can understand why same people don't use computers. Maybe they dont know how to use one have better things to CAPS2, or can't afford one. First of CAPS5, they dont know how to use one. I remember when my friend was over and I was on a computer. and he CAPS4 ""CAPS2 you know that some people don't know how to use an computer?"" And I CAPS4 ""CAPS3 who?"" the CAPS4 ""CAPS3 me, I dont know to use one."" I CAPS4 well I'll teach you. Since then CAPS5 my friend does is go on the computer. One day he says to me because of I want to work with computers. this is one of my reasons why people don't use computers. Second of CAPS5, have better things to CAPS2. MONTH1 be someone has a game. for example, I mostly have how time to go on the computer. Usually I have a basketball game or practice I get home from practice and feel exhausled, CAPS5 I want to CAPS2 is go to CAPS6. why parents come have not wanting to CAPS2 anything. I'll tell you why. Because CAPS5 that haved They CAPS2 CAPS5 day. This is another one of my reasons why people dont use computers. Third of CAPS5 can't afford one. Some people dont have a lot of money to buy a computer. They have to say it. so they can live in a house. When parent's children asle for something parents shoudn't buy it. They buy it so you dont feel hurt. When I'm a CAPS7 im going to make sure I have enough money to buy it. If not then I guess that child is out of luck. So dont be going where bragging your computer because some can't afford one. This is my last reason why people don't use computers. this is why some people don't use computers now in days. Because they dont know how to use one, have something better to CAPS2 and can't afford one. By the way; PERCENT1 of the pupils of ORGANIZATION1 dont have computers.",0
"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author was mostly happiness and celebration. The author constantly talks about how his home was a wonderful place and a happy environment to live in. One example was in paragraph NUM1. It talks about the endless celebrations and countless congregations of family and friends. This is clearly a happy thing to happen. Also, in paragraph NUM2 it talks about the wondrous joining of the different cultures in the neighborhood. It was wonderful because at that time there was much trouble with segragation and racism. It created a happy environment to live in compared to the many other towns with horrible racism and segregation. Finally, in paragraph NUM3 it talks about how their arms and doors were open to anyone who needed them. This allowed not only them to be happy but for other people to share their happiness with them. In this memoir the mood created by the author is mostly happiness and celebration.",0
"In the story Winter Hibiscus, Saeng had failed her drivers test and as she is walking home she spies a flower that reminds her of what once her home.

"Wouldn't you say that having a computer in your house is helpful? It provides useful information to everyone. It can be used for personal use, such as for talking to friends. If there is a child in the house they might have to search something up on the internet for school. If you need directions to a place or you want to find out more about a specific person, a computer can help you. If you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends just tell them to use a computer! These are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as CAPS1, CAPS2, CAPS3, CAPS4 CAPS5, CAPS6, and even email! If you need to make quick plans maybe for a movie with a couple of friends just send them an email or a message on CAPS2. Now, an CAPS1 you can text people right from your computer! If you're afraid someone might not get the email in time, just enter their cell phone number on CAPS1 and a text. It's free too! Now that our world has become more technologically advanced schools often tend to tell students to look something up on a computer or maybe to do a homework assignment posted on their webpage. If a child does not have a computer at home this will. Make it hard for them to do their homework. Also, if a perent decides to start a business from have a computer would be required to cant up profits and to talk with customers. A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards. Need directions to a restaurant? Or maybe a local gym? A computer can help you find directions to almost CAPS10 plan on earth. ORGANIZATION1 CAPS11 is a reliable website to get directions. You can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in ORGANIZATION1. If you need someone phone number but don't have a phone book you can use CAPS12 pages to help you. So, now I hope you can see that computers effect people in a positive way. They help you keep in touch with friends and save you money. They help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home. If you need directions or help finding a phone number, a computer can help in multiple ways. Having a computer could make you have draw perspective of everything.",0
"It was unrealistic and also unsafe of engineers to think that they could have dirigibles dock on the building. One major problem with the idea that the dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Also the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure would cause a problem for the foundation. Another thing, dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if one of the exploded it would have been a disaster for downtown New York. This is why the idea is neither practical or safe.",0

The CAPS1 Had to modify and strengthen the building to Accommodate the new situation. The dirigible was CAPS8 big that they could not even ancker the Back of it to the roof. The CAPS1 Had A CAPS6 time trying to figure out How the dirigibles would land Because the wind was CAPS7 CAPS8 CAPS6 the pilot could not even controll the dirigible.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saengs outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland. The geese are familiar to Saeng now  despite her thinking of them as strange before. The hibiscus is a piece of her past, adapted to fit her current situation. Saengs vow that she will take that test again in the spring, When the snows meltetc. This shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story. It was how the thrends of Saengs past and her present are entwined , and displays her attitude towards the future. With its optimistic words the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret. The authors wording was very well done.",0
"Libraries have tons of books from comedy all the way to violent.Some people like reading books about war and violence while others find it offencive. No matter what the book is about people have the choice to read them or not so why should libraries have to remove books that some might find offensive? They shouldn't! Every one has different views on ideas, and not everyone is alike. If all the books that were offencive to someone where takin off the shelf, there would be no more books left.     People walk into the library and most of the time books are labled by what they are about. They walk to the section they like and pick out a book and normaly don't go to the section that they don't like. There is no reason to go to the section that they dont like becasue they wont be reading a book from there becasue they dont like it. They would just cause problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books. People have the choice to read a book or not so why bother even worry what other people are reading as long as they are happy with what thye have. If a parent does not want a child to read a certain type of book that is their buisness but other parents might want their child to soo what all is out there and develope their child's views on subjects.     Everyone has different views and ideas. If every one was the same the world would be boring and there would be notheing to talk about. By reading different types of books and listening to different types of music there is always somthing to talk about becasue not everyone knows the same subjects. Reading a new kind of book might even open people's eyes to what differences there are in the world. Children often times are more open to different ideas than adults are so if the books are not there for children to try and read they will never know what they like and do not like. A book a child likes MONTH1 not be that a nother child likes or even an adult likes but that is normal, people are not the same.      If everyone took the books or music off the self that they found offensive there wouldn't be very much of anything left on the shelves. Styles are most the time oppisits, like comedy and sad books. Most poeple who would like comedy wouldn't like sad and visa-versa there fore they would take the other off the shelf so neither would have anything to read or listen to. Even with some of the best selling books poeple wonder why or how so many sold but thats just how it is. People out there like the book so if one person didnt like it all those people would never have known what that book is about and MONTH1 have changed their life. Books can be very impactfull in people's lives and if they never read that book the change would never have been made to their life.The world goes round becasue of differences and the world becomes a better place because of different ideas. everyone cannot be the same it just would not work.      Libraries should not have to take books off the shelf just because someone found it offensive or did not like it. People have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting. Moreover, if everyone tooks books and music off the shelves they did not like there would not be very many books and music left. So if you run into a book or some music you dont like just ignore it, dont read it or listen to it. Things will be much simpler in the long run.",0
"Softball has to be one of the single most greatest sports alive; playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine. I love the dirt that sticks to your face, the sweat dripping from your forehead, and the gallons and gallons of water you poor all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering CAPS2. Although I love softball I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates, are the things you remember the most through out your softball career. I have always had great memories through softball many laughs, tears, and frustrations so when I had the opportunity to play on a top notch team I looked forward to all the many more memories I would have.  Hood CAPS1 CAPS2 was my team name, I had played almost four years with this local team. Many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them. I felt like I had my set team, I was going to play with these girls all though high school and we would become even closer. As my fifth year now approached I was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe I play for a team not as locally, that idea was also very enticing. I now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended; or play with a team I knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better then me, and looked down upon me. As I looked at the pros and cons of both teams I decided no; I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at. At that point softball was just around the corner and I began to reanalyze everything. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player; maybe i could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. I then decided I would take a chance and try for this team.  As my dad and I drove to the field where I would try out for this team, my stomach was in knots. I wanted this team to like me, I was playing all the possible ways in my head I could greet them so i didn't sound snobby or a grump. The time moved quickly and I wished it would slow; my heart felt like it was beating a million times per second. I was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it, soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said ""ready or not here we come"". Nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I was second guessing every move I made, I even had troubles removing my seat belt.  As I approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion, walking by I saw all the girls turn there heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. My first thought was to run; that was it I didn't want to go, I was done I wanted home I was ready to start my year with the CAPS2, I just couldn't take it. Then as I walked onto the field they all grew a smile. Each and everyone of them told me their names, there favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. I found myself laughing through out my whole try out, there were no awkward moments and I enjoyed my time there. I couldn't wait to go back, I now had made new friends, friends I knew I would grow close with. My year with this team was amazing I have friendships with these girls that I never would have discovered if I hadn't gone. Those girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. Laughter played a very big role in the decision I made to play with this team, if I had just gone and tried out, and had I not had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the CAPS2. I have had great memories with the CAPS2, but also softball is all about going out discovering new friendships; therefore, enjoying the sport as well as the people.",0
"In the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author talks about the many obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. The first obstacle they faced involved dropping the mast onto the buildings flat roof. This task would be easy because using a single cable to lower the mast would add a great deal of stress to the buildings frame. Another problem they faced was nature. The violent winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. The greatest obstacle involved safety. Lots of blimps outside of the LOCATION2 use highly flammable helium, rather than hydrogen. Helium makes the dirigibles more likely to cause an explosion, and risk many lives of the people of New York. Lastly, existing laws in New York CAPS1 the balloons to dock. Airships were flying dangerously close over urban areas. Many obstacles were faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building that were mentioned in the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.",0

"My boyfriend and I planned to go to the NUM1 CAPS1 CAPS2 fair that they put in LOCATION1, OR. He asked my mom if she would let me go with him to the fair LOCATION1 LOCATION1 and surprisingly my mom said ""yeah you can go"" i was really exited cause that would be our first NUM1 CAPS1 CAPS2 together. We were thinking of how it would be and we laughed because we were saying ""what if we were on a ride and we fell out,"" but knowing it wouldn't really happen. The day before NUM1 CAPS1 CAPS2 i got all my things ready for that day. i was really exited and nervous cause I've never been on rides like that so i probably didn't go to sleep till NUM4 in the TIME1.  NUM1 CAPS1 CAPS2 was on a DATE1, I didn't wanna go to school so my mom let me go to the fair instead of school. I woke up laughing and with a smile on my face because of all the things that were going through my head. I got ready, my boyfriend PERSON1 his brother and his sister came to pick me and my friend up around TIME3. We drove to the CAPS9 station, parked and got our bus fare. After we got on the CAPS9, we took a seat and we were taking pictures and making jokes. Since we got in the CAPS9 it their was nothing but laughter. I'm pretty sure the rest of the passengers thought we were crazy. It took about NUM6 minutes to get to were the fair was at, when we got off the CAPS9. We ran to the gates to get our tickets. But it wasn't NUM7 so they weren't opened so we had to wait NUM8 minutes till they opened the gates. Once we got in this lady was selling a card that had the tokens in it, so we bought it and got on a spider ride which at first didn't look as scary but it moved really fast so i was sliding everywhere. PERSON1 and his brother were laughing at me and my friend ORGANIZATION2 cause we were yelling but after a couple of seconds i stopped yelling and i ended up laughing for no reason i just laughed and laughed until i finally stopped and we got off. After that ride i wasn't really in the mood of yelling or looking dumb in front of the other people that were at the fair so we didn't get on any for a while until we saw the ORGANIZATION3 wheel we got on it. It was fun but it moved a lot so it reminded me of what PERSON1 and I were talking about ""that how funny would it be if we fell out."" so i held the pole that was in the middle and PERSON1 and them started to laugh so i let go and started laughing to cause the were making weird faces at me. When the ride was over we got off and went to go get something to eat from a tent that they had at the fair that was selling food, drinks and a lot of other things. We all bought a big bean and cheese burrito, ORGANIZATION1, churros and an elephant ear. It was so good we wanted to buy more but we didn't have enough money. So we bought another elephant ear and I was the only one that actually ate all of it. So they started laughing because they we saying ""if you could eat two big elephant ears you could probably eat an entire elephant"" I laughed with then then said ""I bet I could, I'm just playing but these elephant ears are really good so I would eat twenty elephant ears"" they laughed and laughed so i just laughed with them as well. After I got done eating, we walked around the fair looking at the other tents they had. Their was a tent that spray painted your name or whatever you wanted on the shirt or sweater. But the bad thing was that we didn't have enough money for the sweater or for the rides so we just choose to go on all the rides and if we had left over money we would go back to buy a sweater. Then we pasted by a photo booth were they took a picture of you dressed up as if you were a pilgrim. I thought it was funny so i started laughing and my friends started to laugh as well because they didn't know what i was laughing about until i told them. Then they started laughing even more. We got on the last four rides and it was about TIME2 we had to leave so we left waited for the CAPS9. As we were waiting for the CAPS9 two security guys come on their two horses and I thought its weird seeing horses in the city, we started to laugh. We got on the CAPS9, took some pictures and went home.",0

I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.",0
"CAPS2 you think computer's are good to use? More and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits soceiety I srong disagree. My first reason is because computer's are not safe. My second reason is computer's could get you in a lot of troble. My CAPS3 reason is you never know what could happen on the computer. Read on and see why I disagree. First CAPS4 gonna tell you why I disagree. The reason why I disagree is because computer's are not safe because you could have someone trace where you live at then what? Second - computer's could get you into a lot of trobe such as posting things online or saying mean thing's to people. Next computer's are bad because if someone like's you and you say I dont like you they could post mean and hurt full thing's and then if you friend's see it you will probably get mad. Finally - in concusion thease are all my reason's why I think computer's are not good. You never know what coud happen on a computer there's website's there and some could start a virus on your computer. Also I think computer's are not good because computer's lead to no good so keep your child away from computers. Also be careful what chu CAPS2.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as structural support issues, shifting winds, and administrative interference. One major problem arose when they realized the force of holding the blimp in place ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (par. NUM1). This meant builders had to make changes to the support system of the building itself before being able to begin construction on the mooring device. Once the mast and reconstruction work completed, builders realize that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (par. NUM2), which would make docking almost impossible. Attempts to moor became even moor difficult as ""complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed"" (par. NUM3). This shows how builders struggled with bureaucracy in their attempts to build the mooring mast. In conclusion, the shortsightedness of the project caused builders to struggle with the building's structure, weather, and the owners' vision, before ultimately abandoning the mast.",0
"The features affected the cyclist in many ways, one being the highway sign, ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" The terrain was now short, rolling hills, which would make it harder on the cyclist to pedal up the hills, for it would take a lot more effort and energy. Also, there were roadblocks, at some point, tumbleweeds blocked my path and a ridiculously large snake These roadblock would danger the biker, for hed have to manever around them, losing time and energy, resulting in drinking more water. No water is a great danger for it was June, a hot day and he is risking getting dehydrated. There was also nobody around, so if he desperatly needed water he couldnt",0
"I have heard that people are thinking of how computers are having a bad effect on people and I disagree. Computers help people so much in schools, work places, and at home. Not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers. For students it is an absolute neccesity to do research , and type essays, letters and so many other writing pieces, and the same goes for all of society. In almost every school all over the country, students use computers on a daily basis. I personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week and some ORGANIZATION1 even more. For example my CAPS1 teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters. She has told us over and over that if our hand writing is not good she won't grade it. Having the computers to type on removes the fact that if our teacher can't read it she can't grade it. I understand that people would say that it makes people need to hand write the things a lot less and people would lose the ability to hand write things but with such advenced technology on computers and to type anything with such pose, soon hand writing will no longer ne required. Any person for whatever research they need can be found so easily using a computer. For students in any grade level and any class, research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher. Using books and other means of research are slow and in efective. Getting onto a computer and looking up the pic is fast and simple and gives better results than books. The same goes for jobs, for example a person might need to set up a powerpoint presentation. Not only does the computer have powerpoint on it - which is an effective way of setting up projects the computer allows that person to do research all in one place. This makes it so much simplier to get a lot of information and not have to run around getting books and talking to people who know the subject. I understand that computers could ""take control"" of people and people would spend to much time on them. But of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time, keeping computers would benefit in so many ways. Writing many different essays, letters, typing for projects, and doing research would be done faster and easier.",0
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...(Kurmaskie NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his llife. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesnt have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June (Kurmaskie NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water.",0
"Being with people that can always make you feel comfortable and be yourself around is most likely the best quality in a friend. Everyone has their flaws; a friend can always look past them and find the good in the one that they trust. A friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry. Making someone laugh can always help when they think that it's not possible for their life to get any worse. Laughter is the most valued gift that can be given. You know inside that it's making them happy just from seeing the smile on their face. There have been many times in my life where I have laughed so hard that I cried. There is truly no greater feeling in the world than knowing that you have people in your life that can cheer you up just by doing or even saying something so ridiculous that it just breaks you into a hysterical laughter. I laugh a lot throughout the day. When I don't, people get suspicious and they feel like there's something wrong with me. That's literally how much of a role that laughing plays in my life. Laughing is my second language in life. There has been one time in particular in my life span so far that has made me laugh so hard that I cried tremendously hard. My friends were staying the TIME1 at my house and we were just being boys. We did so many things that mad us question our sanity: we at hot sauce by the spoon full, we watched comedy shows, and we also ate ourselves sick. It was the time of a lifetime and we laughed through it all. While watching the comedy shows, we couldn't breath. We were laughing so hard! Nothing could make me stop laughing; I would just keep replaying every joke in my head and I'd start laughing even more. I already hurt so much as it was when we were watching it from earlier. The comedian was a magician with words; the way he put them all together to just seemed like he was reading a sacred scroll from ancient times. I laughed and cried over and over again. I probably did that for ten minutes straight! It was unbelievable. Making these life-long memories with my friends is something that I will never forget. I truly know how great I have it in my life; people would kill to be in my shoes and to get the love and support I get from my friends and family. All my experiences are the things I learn from, whether they're good or bad, I know that its all going to help me later in life to be able to make the right decision when it is presented to me. All the laughs i share with other people makes me know that they have had a good time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me. They made a point in my day great as well. Being myself around them is great as well because I know that they're already accepted me into their lives and I don't have to try to be anyone else.  Everyone laughs at some point or another throughout their lives no matter how much they deny it. I really don't even know why they would because what better feeling is there than being able to let out a little giggle every once in a while? I really don't think that there is any. I feel really honored that I have such amazing people in my life that always make it exciting and full of laughter and life. It shouldn't be any other way in my personal opinion. Live life to the fullest; why would you want to live it any other way?",0
"Banned books.'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work that I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'

People have a right to their oppinion, but i do not think any one has the right to take books away from a CAPS1 library.      CAPS1 library, the facts are in the name. It CAPS5 a CAPS1 library, where people can go and find a book to pass time, a book to use on an CAPS2 assignment, or a book to read to their child. Taking a book off the shelves just because it offendid someone does not makes sense to me. A person can pick up a book, be offended and complian about it, that CAPS5 freedom of speech. I do not see fault in that. But when a person picks up a book, CAPS5 offendid,and demand that the book per se CAPS5 taken off the shelves of a CAPS1 library. That CAPS5 when i have issues seeing where they think they have the right.     Katherine Paterson said in her text that 'If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then you aslo have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelve for any of us.' CAPS3't that a scary thought? If a person was offended by a book they could take it off the shelve at his or her own will? I fear the out come of that. I am sure that a person could figure out something offensive about any book.      Taking books off the shelve CAPS5 taking knowledge away from the people. We as CAPS4 have the right to read at our pleasure, any book that we have the slighest whim to read, and be able to read that book with out prosecution from a people that find the book in question 'offensive.'     The day we let people take books off the shelves because they offend them, CAPS5 the day our first admendment fails. As a nation we need to stand stron againts banning books from CAPS1 libraries. For our generation and for the many generations to follow.",0

For example, Narciso and his parents had to leave there home and Come to the United States where they all Struggled financially and personally living through the cold winters and facing Cultural hardships.However, the mood was also grateful. Narciso was very grateful for his Parents for all that they have sacrificed for him to have a better life and all that they have taught him made the moode of the memoir grateful.Lastly, the mood was also proud.

"This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez has a grateful mood. CAPS1 is thanking his nieghbors for the unity that CAPS1 had in his community and explaining how CAPS1 learned about family from them. CAPS1 is also thanking his parents for giving up everything they had in Cuba to give him a good home. For example, CAPS1 explains that CAPS1 had a ""close-knit community of honest, hardworking,"" ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when Overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed."" CAPS1 says his neighbors helped people who were, ""not necessarily their own kind, (but) were clearly in need."" In paragraph NUM1, CAPS1 describes the things CAPS1 loved about his ""traditional Cuban home"". In paragraph NUM2, CAPS1 says, ""My Mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love. CAPS1 describes his parents hardships and says CAPS1 will, ""always be grateful... for their love and sacrifice."" CAPS1 makes it clear that the passage is written with gratitude.",0
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test. She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome. It MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.",0
"The advansing technology is showing a very negative affect on people. Because of computers people are spending too much time on computer and less time doing things that are better for them. First, spending too much time on the computer can be bad for your health in many ways. For example, looking at a bright computer screan for more than NUM1 min at a time is extremely bad for your eyes. The brightness damages your eyes and can lead to severe loss of vision. Also, if you spend all of your time indoors and on the computer you will not get the exersize you need. PERSON1, were you aware that for every NUM2 min you are on the computer you should spend NUM2 min outside. It is very important to get fresh air, sunlight, and exersize. Moreover, another problemwith computers is that you don't get as much interaction with people. With online chatting you can't know what the other person is feeling like, PERSON1, or if you are even talking to other person you think you're talking to. It is much better to interact with people in person, face to face. To have good social health you need to hang out with friends, and laugh, and have a good time, not sit in a dark room and talk with online friends. PERSON1, people need to interact with real people. Furthermore, computers can be very distracting to many people. For example, PERSON1, say you needed to type up an article for the paper on the computer, but you decide to play a game for a min, or look something up, or talk with a friend. You say that it will only take a minute and then you with type the article. But when you stop all of a sudden you played for NUM4 hours. Then you have to stay up later to finish. Computers are extremely distracting. People of all ages have this problem of being distracted by computers and not gettind work done. In conclusion, computers, although an advance in technology, have very negative side affects. PERSON1, I feel that it is our job to tell the people of the negitive side effects of computers. It is our job to help people over come the side affects of computers. Please PERSON1, we need to help the people by writing an article in the paper to warn them of the terrible effects computers have.",0
"During any type of construction, the builders face some type of obstacles, as do the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced in attempting to let dirigibles dock on the Empire State building is the high flammability they have. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships to fly too low over urban areas, like New York. Seeing the obstacles they faced, the builders realized that being able to moor a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building just was not meant to be.",0
"Advances in technology, while amazing, don't always have a positive effect on society. That is why, I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community. For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, ""don't talk to strangers,"" when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them. If people spent just as much time helping their community as much time helping their community as they did on the computer, the world would be a much better place to live. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy. I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen! Lastly, computers are like vampires, sucking away your money. In DATE1's economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes! Additionaly, at the rate that technology is advances, even the most high-tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed. Also, computers' prices are constantly rising. It is very hard to keep up! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down. All in all, computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the LOCATION1. First off they can be dangerous. Secondly, they are too time consuming and, thirdly, computers are too expensive. Computers just simply are a hassle in DATE1's world.",0
"I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng wont give up & will keep trying. In the story all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong. For example the flower made her sad but in the end it made her better. Also in the beginning she didnt really like new changes and she missed home, but at the end some of the same memories she had back home were in her new country. Those are the reasons I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph",0
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. CAPS1 are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels,""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds."" A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story.",0
"Narciso PERSON1 so proud he was Cuban immigrante and how his parent did so much for him. he realized that (in paragraphy NUM1) family had nothing to do with being blood relative.

How his parent turn a regluar house into home that he loved. He was grateful how his parent made so many sacrifice that turn something into life time expenence that he will never forget.

"Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If its too hot, youre going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If its all down hill, its really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist",0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says In the spring when the snows melt because she is beginning to get used to the quiet repetition of season upon season. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.",0
"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng was not prepare for this test, because she was not accustom to the place, but after seeing the plants that reminded her of home, and knowing that the spring time is when more will blossom, she will be ready to take the test over.",0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test.",0
The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring.,0
The reason why I feel the authour ended the story with this paragraph is because she is showing how the charater has matured and how the charater grew in her circumstance. This shows that because you failed once doesnt mean your going to fail again. Also its okay to feel out of place there is alway going to be a time in life where a new beginning is going to start so it is your choice to take that chance or be stuck in your own ways but the decision is always up to you.,0
"In their attempt to build a docking mast on the top of the Empire State Building, the builders came up on structural, safety, and practicality obstacles. In order to have the mast on top of the building the builders had to strengthen the steel, ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"". Also, they had safety concerns about letting a dirigible dock in a city, on a skyscraper. One of these concerns was the use of the flamable gas hydrogen that was used in non-American dirigibles. If a dirigible caught fire over the city the effects of it would be bad. Furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was at the will of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, this meant the dirigible on the mast could then swivel around, making it danger to citizens. The mast was also in-practical, due to a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. And finally, in later years dirigibles had ""given way to airplanes,"" thus making the mooring mast for dirigibles useless. The builders of the Empire State Building never succeeded in their attempt of putting an active mooring mast on top of the building, because of structural, safety, and practicality obstacles that they stumbled upon.",0

"A question that recently came to my attention is people are spending to much time on the computer, and if this is a good thing, I believe that computers are a good electronic item to have. I think this because, it helps people learn. Also, people can keep in touch with their friends even if they I've in a different country. In addition, it can help people or students be CAPS1 please consider this in our newspaper. Would you like studentspeople to have internet and searches that can help them learn? The answer is ""yes"". Having to computers can help students to learn. They can go onto LOCATION2 and type in any question they want to be answered. Picture this a child has a question that she wants answered, but she is embarrased to ask her parents. She can simply type the question in on her computer and get hundreds of answers. There is nobody in the world that knows everything, but there are computers that do. Computers can give you the answer to any question. When my mom was little she didn't have access to a computer all the time. CAPS1 when she had a question she would have to ask somebody she know. If they didn't know the answer than she couldn't know the answer. If more people had computers then they would the to questions. Computers are a good way to keep in touch with people. These are CAPS4 programs such as CAPS2, CAPS3, aim, ect.. My dad owns a buisness and needs to be in touch with people for seven CAPS1 he around his iphone to talk to them by email. It helps my dad know when pappers and whos asking on what. I asked ten adults if they think everyone should have to a computer and ten out of ten said ""yes."" CAPS4 people think that friends and family important and should stay with them every and a while. I have a friend who lives in LOCATION1, but I cant contact her with my phone because are doesnt me and her talk on CAPS2 all the time. CAPS1 if people dont own phones then you can still stay in contact with computers. if they far away. Do you have perfect handwriting? The answer is probably no. People use ORGANIZATION1 all the time because there handwriting isn't Computers help people stay clean and tidy. Computers have of folders and programs to store information you need. This all stays next all on the computer. My friend just get a computer for her office. Before she got it one hand everything and kep them all her desk in a mess. She had filled with pappers. But after she got a computer she typed everything neatly and kept all her pappers in the folders of her computer. She was CAPS1 neat and clean that she got promoted. My friends moms changed because she got a computer. She became and cleaner. Picture this you are overwhelmed by all the papers on your desk. You dont know what papper is what. Well if you had a computer you could type eerything and keep them in your computer files. also PERCENT1 of adults staying is good. I know you the local newspaper, have a very hard job and decision to make. I beileve that computers are good and helpful. Because they can help people find information they need. Also, they can keep people in touch with buisness workers, friend, students, family, ect. In addition, computers can help people get neat and clean. CAPS1 please consider puting my essay in the Newspaper.",0
"LOCATION3 has always been my place of choice to travel to whenever my parents question me of where I would like to go during the DATE1. The rolling green hills, stunning sunsets, and thrilling thunderstorms are certainly a large part for my reason to go, but the idea of seeing my CAPS7's side of the family again overpowers all of my other reasons. The core of my LOCATION3 family has always been my CAPS1 CAPS2; with her friendly smile, caring personality, and a sharp sense of humor, she makes friends and acquaintances wherever she goes. Yet, due to the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart, I'm only able to see CAPS1 CAPS2 three times each year: my family drives up to her house twice every DATE1, and she drives down to my grandparent's house for a few weeks in the DATE2. I cherish every moment I spend with her, especially when she accidentally makes a fool of herself and causes hysterics.   A few summers ago, CAPS1 CAPS2, my CAPS7, and I traveled up to LOCATION2 to check out some of the town's antique and flower shops before dinner. We had spent a few hours driving around town, scoping out all of these shops to raid them of any gems that either CAPS7 or CAPS1 CAPS2 must have for their already old-fashioned homes. I had lost interest after the first few hours; antique shopping was never a passion of mine, and I was ready to take the one hour trip back to LOCATION1 to go swimming with my cousins.     Once CAPS7 and CAPS1 CAPS2 had spent most of their money on a couple of ""treasures"" a few hours later, we were exhausted and prepared to head home when we happened upon a pizza shop down the main street. Our mouths watered at the thought of eating a slice, but rather than going inside to eat, we ordered a pizza to take home and bake instead. In her white ORGANIZATION2 pick-up, my CAPS1 pulled into the shop's parking lot, leaving CAPS7 and I inside while she grabbed the pizza. Upon her return a few minutes later, the aroma of the pizza wafted through the cab, making our mouths water and our desire to get home to grow exponentially. CAPS1 CAPS2 placed the pizza in the back seat, grabbed her coffee, and revved up the engine. We were all lost in our own thoughts about sneaking a slice of pizza when suddenly the front tires of the pick up dipped down and thumped onto the road. CAPS1 CAPS2 nearly dropped her hot coffee all over her lap, while CAPS7 panicked and grabbed the handle on the door in reflex. We were all flabbergasted, stunned as little kids trying to grasp that the ORGANIZATION1 didn't exist. Moments after the initial panic, we realized that CAPS1 CAPS2 had accidentally driven over the curb. We burst into laughter while poor CAPS1 CAPS2 had a red-rose face and an apologetic smile wider than the ORGANIZATION3. She cautiously drove with the traffic, laughing hysterically with tears in her sea blue eyes along with CAPS7 and I.   Our hysteria episode lasted for a few minutes, in which time CAPS1 CAPS2 had pulled into a vacant parking lot; none of us wanted another unplanned adventure on the road. I wiped the tears from my eyes, trying to stifle the laughter and recompose myself. CAPS7 was still giggling and wiping the mascara off her face. CAPS1 CAPS2 was doing the same, and then turned around to look at me. She locked her bright eyes with mine and smiled as sweetly as only she could, and we burst into more hysterics.   After CAPS28 next small hysterical episode was over, we were finally able to pull back onto the street with the rest of civilization. As CAPS1 CAPS2 pulled out cautiously, I burst out, ""CAPS27 not to run over anymore curbs!"" CAPS28 drew up another round of laughter.  CAPS1 CAPS2 has always been there for me, through the laughter and the tears. Because we are family, we have a natural bond between each other. Yet without laughter, CAPS28 bond would not be nearly as close and glued together as it currently is. Hundreds of miles of farmland and open road separates us. The occasional phone calls and e-mails are all we have to communicate between each other. My CAPS1 is the most caring, humorous, and loving person I have ever encountered, and I unfortunately don't get to spend as much time with her as I would like. But every time I see her, I smile and think of the comical stories we have between each other. Without the humor and laughter we share, our bond would not be as close as it is, and we would both be clueless to our current world of joy.",0
"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed it or fail it. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle.In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U. S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time. Who would want in enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways?",0

"The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many obstacles. The fist one to come into play was the support of the building. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduse the stability of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars' went into modifications of the building's framework.Another problem was the dirigibles themselfs. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg inncodent, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accadent such as this would be even more devastaing over a densly populated area. After being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was put to rest for the safety of the people.",0
"Do you spend all or most of your freetime sitting at your computer? People are spending too much time on computers. Obesity is a growing problem in today's society, people need to interact with eachother, and we need to get some fresh air. Computer are ruining these things for people. Unplug yourself from your computer. More and more people are becoming obese. This is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers. There is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer. People need to get outside and go jogging, play games or ride their bikes. Cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face. To our whole life, we will have to interact and socialize with others. If you don't develop these skills, you won't be happy where you end up. Talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face. Get out and get some fresh air. Go experience nature. Bring out on the beach, hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most. Fresh air clear your mind. Time says that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer. People need to releave stress so go outside. Click turn off your computers and get out of your chair. Go get some exercise, go interact with friendsand family, or even just go outside and get some fresh air while relaxing.

"There should be a certain age bookshelf that only certain aged people are aloud to look at. It's like the adult section at the library. Theres no reason why they should be removed off of the shelves. I would understand if the little kids could come see the books and movies and be offended by it or scared but thats why you would make a certain section just for older more mature people.     It would just depend on what offends people and what would make them offended. Some things could or would be bad to have little kids see them, but just make sure they couldnt get in the reach of young kids or not matured people. The only way i would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that.     Censorship in libraries in my opinion is a good thing. Just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library. So I would have to say yes on cersorship in the library.",0

Nature played a key role in this project. The winds around the building ""were constantly shifting"" because of the location of the building. When the to blimps attempted to go near to test it out One was too unstable to dock and the other through paper down a rope ""after this stunt the idea of the mooring mast was shelved.""

"Based on the exerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is as follows. The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obsticle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" CAPS1, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title.",0

"The empire state builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been above a densely populated area such as down town newyork. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another obstical the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped.",0
"I don't think censorship should be practiced in libraries, CAPS7 it's not fair to everybody. If censorship was practiced everywhere, there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out, due to a large amount of people complaining. I have a few reasons also CAPS6 I think there should not be censorship in libraries.     CAPS5 first reason is freedom of the press. In our ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right of writing what we want, and if censorship continues, we will lose one of our rights. I don't think that's fair to control what we want to write or read.     Another reason I have would be freedom of speech. Also written in our ORGANIZATION1 of ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right to say what we want, and nobody can control that. If we keep using censorship, then this right will also be taken away from us. We're slowly losing our CAPS1 given rights, CAPS7 people are offended by books and things of that nature.     A personal experience I have was one day CAPS5 friend and I were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report. The report had to be over the DATE1's and slavery. Unfortunately, CAPS5 friend was CAPS2 CAPS3, and he had a hard time not being offended by the assignment. When we got to the library, things got worse. All of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then.     CAPS5 friend was getting very upset at this point. Finally, he saw another book making fun of the slaves, then he went up to the librarian asking, 'CAPS4 you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?' The librarian just looked at him with a straight face and said, 'No. What makes you think you should get any special treatment?' CAPS5 friend was dumbfounded. He couldn't believe what he had just heard.     After he had came back over to where I was sitting, I had told him that she was right. 'CAPS6's that?', he said. I said, 'CAPS7 if she would've taken all those books down, she would've had to take about every other book down too, CAPS7 somebody would find something hurtful.' 'You know, your probably right,' he said.     Censorship isn't fair, CAPS7 it limits us to our abilities and what we enjoy. It's not fair to punish other people based on what they read, write, or say. We all have our own preferences; how would you like it if yours got taken away?",0
"The Empire State Building faced various obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly was the danger involved in this ambitious plan. Blimps from outside the LOCATION3 commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible destroyed in a fire, owners of the Empire State Building saw the true danagers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude made it difficult to dock. Once docked the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which was ""neither pratical or safe"". The existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas create further probles. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds the owners started to see the unsolved problems. By the late 1930's the idea had ""quietly disappeared"".",0
"Architects and builders faced several obstacles when attempting to build the empire state building and allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was S keeping a safe environment. Dirigibles that are fueled by hydrogen are prone to be destroyed by fire. One example of this is in paragraph NUM1, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Another major obstacle was high wind speeds and violent air currents. These made dangerous because the back of the ship would be swung around the mooring mast. Lastly, another obstacle that they faced was a law. In paragraph NUM2, it says, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would keep dirigibles from being able to ever dock there or even fly in the general area. All of these obstacles could not be overcome so in the end the mooring mast was not successful.",0
"Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the chemistry in a couple, and it shows happiness within family and friends. How depressing would it be if the world had no laughter? It would be like the ""CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4"". The joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them you have a warm heart. Ideally, when a person has a warm heart, your conscience tells you, you can trust them. The talent to laugh is a good element to have when you are meeting someone new, and spending time with your family. Last DATE1, my youth group and I went on a missions trip to ORGANIZATION1, LOCATION1. We would be reaching out to many new children as we held a ORGANIZATION2 for a week in the small CAPS5 town. We picked up the children from their houses and drove them to the ORGANIZATION1 to play games and sing songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come into their neighborhood with our straight serious faces in our big twelve passenger white vans, it would send out a different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with crayola car paint markers and jumped out of the vans energetically with big bright smiles. We ran up to a house door, rung the doorbell, and asked the parents if their children wanted to come to our ORGANIZATION2. We had to remember that these kids live in poverty and have gone through a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and let us tell them about CAPS6. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would always smile and twinkle. A lot of the children just needed love and we did so by laughing with them and making jokes to one another.  Assuredly, our youth group made a change in the children lives. Our ORGANIZATION2 is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In ORGANIZATION1, the town's appearance is flat like a desert, there's no playgrounds, parks, or places they can go to and have fun. CAPS8 gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun DATE1 to remember. CAPS8 opened the hearts of the CAPS5 children so that they MONTH1 hear the word of CAPS8. I honestly don't think we could have reached out to them if we had not been a friendly bunch. It just shows how important it is to laugh with one another, whether it be with strangers or your family. If there is no laughter within your family, something is wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost. In commercials, there's always advertisements where families are around the dinner table, or at a restaurant laughing together. Not everybody has to look like that picture perfect family everyday, but when a family laughs with one another, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and have respect for one another. Of course a family does not have to be related, it could be your youth group, your friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chick-flick movie. My cousin, PERSON1, was working at a ski resort at the rental check-outs waxing skis, when a dark haired brunette comes toward him in her baggy snow pants and says, ""I can go down the biggest hill"" with the most flirtatious eyes and grin. Now, PERSON1 was very confused as to why this girl would walk up to him and bluntly say that to him. But PERSON1 was mesmerized with this gorgeous girl and all he could say was, ""CAPS9"". The girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was. An hour later, PERSON1 and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. It turns out, this girl's name is ""PERSON2"". Apparently, PERSON2's friends spotted PERSON1 first and told PERSON2 the guy had a great laugh and he looked like a good person. They urged PERSON2 to ask him out and get to know him. PERSON2, being the daring one, agreed. PERSON1's story proves the point that laughter is important. You don't know CAPS2 MONTH1 hear you and how that person could effect your future.  Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings out the joy in people's spirit, gives you opportunities to meet new people, and perhaps change their lives. It reflects CAPS2 you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to be like ""The CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 Laughter"" would we?",0

"Should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Books, movies, magazines, music are made to relay a message, express a point of veiw, or to perhaps state an oppionion, of which everyone has a different point of veiw.     No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores. All of the previously listed things are rated. Movies are rated CAPS1 through CAPS2, books are rated child through adult, and music if explicit has a parental advisery sticker, so just follow the ratings.

People MONTH1 bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it.

"The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance.

"Laughter and exuberance are key elements in any good relationship. Being able to be giddy and joyful with someone close to CAPS11 is a sign of comfort. It often can bring people closer and help to solidify their friendships. Your true self is shown in your humor. Two years ago when I was in PERSON1's seventh grade math class at ORGANIZATION1, I was chosen to be in the ORGANIZATION2 along with just three other classmates. Being in the ORGANIZATION2 simply meant that we would be teaching ourselves CAPS1-CAPS2 using only textbooks, while PERSON1 would teach the rest of the class an easier, more simple math. The ORGANIZATION2 was almost like an elite club. Our other classmates looked upon us with jealousy because we got to sit in the back of the classroom together, never had to do any homework, and were never called upon out of the blue to answer questions in front of the whole class. Being the immature seventh graders that we were, we abused TIME1 incredible opportunity that we had. I became fast friends with the three other people in the ORGANIZATION2. Their names were PERSON4, PERSON3, and CAPS3. PERSON4 and I were already friends, but it was working together in the ORGANIZATION2 that really brought us closer together. I also became close with ORGANIZATION3 and CAPS3. To TIME1 day, PERSON4 is one of my very best friends and I still keep in touch with the other two. We were all very different from each other. PERSON3 was caught up in the popular crowd, CAPS3 usually hung out with the really smart kids who were into chess and reading books, and PERSON4 and I were just normal. However, we all had two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and our intelligence.  We each felt that the work we were teaching ourselves was much too easy. We breezed right through the book and never really had any questions. In doing CAPS8, we always finished our assigned work quickly and had more than half of the class left to just sit there, eat, and goof off. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's the order things played out in. ""PERSON4, I don't feel like doing math DATE2. I'm beat,"" I complained as we walked into PERSON1's room for math right after lunch. ""CAPS6 neither,"" she replied. ""I say we just sit there and make it look like we're doing work."" We made our way to the table in the back where CAPS3 and PERSON3 were already sitting. They had their books, pencils, and spirals out, but sat there with vacant expressions. PERSON4 and I joined them in sitting and we all exchanged disgruntled looks. ""CAPS8 uh, I was talking to LOCATION1 TIME1 and he said that we don't have to do any work DATE2. We can just sit here and hang out,"" I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Catching on, CAPS3 and PERSON3 grinned. PERSON3 turned around and pulled a brown paper bag out of her backpack. She began to pull food out of the bag and offered it all up to us. I immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie. Midway through eating it, I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and wiped a big blob of it on the window behind CAPS6. PERSON4 noticed and immediately started to chuckle. ""CAPS10, what's that?!"" she exclaimed, loud enough for everyone in the class to hear. PERSON1 and a few classmates glanced over briefly, but got back to the lesson instantly. It really wasn't funny at all, but the four of us dissolved into giggles. ""CAPS11 guys, I had TIME1 crazy dream TIME2,"" PERSON3 said as the laughter died down. ""I went to TIME1 DATE1 camp thing, and PERSON2 was one of the camp counselors. He was wearing khaki pants and a white shirt with blue pinstripes. Oh, and he also had a clipboard!"" We stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing once more. The funny thing about TIME1, was that PERSON2 often substituted for our teachers, and he wore that exact outfit each time. But the even funnier thing was that it really wasn't funny at all. We were CAPS8 desperate for a good time, we found chocolate blobs on windows and khaki pants to be hilarious. Our laughter died down and we sat there in silence. Suddenly, CAPS3 leaned back in his squeaky swivel chair and it immediately broke, dropping him right to the ground. To anyone else, TIME1 would have been funny. However, we each sat in silence, staring at one another. It wasn't that we were embarrassed for him or felt sympathy, but simply ironic that obsolete things sent us into fits of giggles, while a substantial, laughable event made us simply sit there. I don't think I'll ever forget the ORGANIZATION2. Though it was a waste of time, we had many good laughs. We MONTH1 not have learned a lot about math, but we learned a lot about each other.",0

"As we understand the benefits of laughter, we realize that we cant live without it. Its one of those things that are always going to be with us through tough times, and the joy of life. So when people say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", well there right! You can think anything you want to, but i want you to know that i have the best laughter in the world when it comes to the boy i have fallen for.  It all started on a softball tournament in bend. Our team drove there for the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed in the LOCATION2 inn hotel. Which was very nice by the way, probably to nice for our team, because we end up destroying the place like a bunch of football players in a locker room, hence the hard practices. After our practice we go ahead and swim in the pool, even know we have a big game the next day. The hotel had two big pools, one outside, and one inside with a sauna. We all go to the inside pool because in was way to cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend PERSON3 and I go into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit. After a while two boys about our age enter the sauna while we were still in there. They acted as if they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us which was kind of awkward, no doubt. When it comes to boys I'm not shy to just speak my mind and to ask them why the hell there just sitting there pretending to mind there own business, and i know for a fact that's not why. We talk a laugh for a bit and got to know each other. One of them was extremely adorable and i hit it off with him very well. It got later into the TIME1 and it was time for all of us to head back to our rooms and say good bye for ever. Me and PERSON3 shared a room with her parents. I had know idea that PERSON3 gave my number to PERSON1, the guy i kind of liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later i get a text saying ""meet me outside to walk around"". So i amused that it was him, and i got all excited! so we snuck out of the room for the TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk, he was barefooted and as cute as can be. I never laughed so hard in my life! He made me smile and feel like i could con-core everything that came my way.  About forty five minutes past, still gazing into each others eyes, feeling like it as only been a second. His friend PERSON2 sees someone walking out a the hotel room and realizes that its his mom. They bolt off saying there goodbyes and at the last second he kisses me on the cheek for his farewell. Never in my life have i experienced something so exciting and fun, and most of all i understand the importance of laughter. Knowing that i would never see him again is what kills me. He lives in CAPS1 and i live in LOCATION1. How could anything possibly happen between us? Maybe some day i will meet him again. Maybe someday i would be able to talk to him again like we did that TIME1, and just maybe, will i fall in love with him. All those maybe's have came true, because i fallowed what was right and i waited. Now sense that all happened i can ponder and relate to laughter and how it effected me in life. That is what brought us together, and I'm happy that all of that could happen so quick in my young life.",0
"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, The mood was pretty much the same throughout. The mood in this CAPS1 of writing was very happy. Narciso Rodriguez was very grateful and happy throughout the CAPS1. He would always say that he was very grateful for his Parents being all nice and coming over here to the united States from Cuba to give him a better life. Also, his family gave up their friends and family, good jobs and all said goodbye. Just to have a chance at a new and better life. He was also very happy, because even though he wasnt in Cuba anymore, he still grew up with a Cuban cuture.",0

The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the hot sun makes the cyclist dehydrated and since there is no water sources around the cyclist is not getting any water. The rough terrain makes the cyclist tired.,0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. The builders had to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment used in building mooring masts, land dirigibles service and a workable arrangement, and modify the building for support of the mast.In preparation to the construction of the mast the architects first took tours of the equipment at the ORGANIZATION1. The builders also met with the president of an airship transport company that offered their services across the Pacific Ocean. A workable arrangement had to be created. It was difficult and tedious to figure, ""on some safe way of mooring ships to this mast."" The foundation of the building had to be considered as well because, ""the architects could not simply dropping mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Over MONEY1 in modifications to the frame and foundation of the building had to be performed. All of these were obstacles in the way of architects building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.",0
"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are brought out. The author brings our ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building. The back of the dirigibles would then swivel which could very well be dangerous. Also the builders had to take into account the fact ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Empire State Building is in the middle of New York, a highly populated State. The explosion of a dirigible at the top of the Building would be very dangerous & would lose a lot of lives. The builders of the Empire State Building under went many challenges in trying to allow Dirigibles to dock.",0
"The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old mens town was now abandoned. (the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a sad, hopeless laugh. The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.",0
"The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective. and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you dont have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist.",0
"Many books and material in libaries are sometimes offensive to certian people but that does not mean they should be taken off the shelves of libaries. Material that might be offensive to one person might have a valuable intrest in another person. If you hated the subject of history and had the right to take it away, then someone else might come along and take away a subject you like like, science. If it is offensive to the general public, it should be placed in a special scection, be avaible behind the counter, or avaible only at specific libaries.     Throught the libaries of the world, there are two general sections, adult, kid, and entertaminet sectioons. In these sections locate many topics and many views of ceartian things. Sometimes it is very offensive and it is almost 'hidden' from view and have to spend all day looking for it. It should be that contreverstial topics should be kept in a closed off section of the libary and can be accesed by the staff so that way none of the pubic can worry.      Like cigarretes at a store, somethings should be behind the counter where the material can have a watchfull eye over it. These subjects include sex, racisim, porn, polotics, and other material like the ones listed. With these items behind the counter, people will not know about it and it will be hidden from view, but still acesiable with special order or request. This would help the public.     Some material, when reached to a specific town, can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community. Some material should be denied from entering small towns and the specified material can only be aquired at large libaries or specific book stores. With material far away, people can be reassured in small towns that material will never upset their community. This is why some material should only have premettid acess under watchfull guard",0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saengs determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when shes in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.",0
"I think computers benefit society greaty. Most of what we do today could not happen without computers. The biggest use of computers is comunication. If you're in LOCATION1 on a buisnoss trip but need to send a letter to your company, you can send an emil which is much less expensive than paying for as piece of CAPS1. The experts concerns that people aren't spending enough time with family and friends is a point. Many people cominucate with family and friends through computers. I would hardely yet to talk to my cousin if I couldn't go on facebook. I would have had to wait another month to find out my other cousin was engaged if I didn't follow her on CAPS2. If the concern is face to face contact, the computer has a cure for that, too, a video messaging site called ooVoo. Another way computers allow comunication is through the shareing of information. Many facts needed for school are spread out in hundreds of books. Over the CAPS3, I've done research for a project and have been able to get facts from the ORGANIZATION1 and ORGANIZATION2 about crime stats. Many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good website to travel to for more information. Without the CAPS3, a simple reasearch project could take for months. Some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer. This both right and wrong. Sitting at a computer watching youtube for hours is not nessasarily the best thing. However, the CAPS4 is also for computer. The CAPS4 has designed a game so that you can have fun while getting excersize. Computers are like chocolate. They can be good, but too much is a bad thing.",0
"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by The CAPS1 prints of our Lives the mood in many thing. The mood is the feel of happiness in his house of his family shows him love and his culture and heritage.

So when I got home I went on my laptop and looked it up so I did and it said nothing about. That but it did say one thing that surprised me. The most it seaid that he was geting a divorce. From his wife I think the peorson how said. That he almost died most of missed read it. So now I look up all my fraverit people.

But befor you choose think about it.",0
The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didnt want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for MONEY1 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore Saeng has changed.,0
"The library is a public place. Everyone is allowed acces to the library. It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there. Since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.     Genres were created for a reason. Certain items have different forms to them. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock, and blues are some examples. Since music is categorized in such a way, there should  be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive.     In the CAPS1 the CAPS2 people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear CAPS3 a part. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library.     Another freedom given to the CAPS2 people is the freedom of press. Anything put onto paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasising about school, it is all legal. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable. Like music, books have many categories. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what.     Movies are located at libraries as well. They are categorized just as much as books and music. The term ' CAPS5 judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes. This can also be used with movies. The title of a moive or book will tell what it is about. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated CAPS6 or NUM1. These ratings help censor things to a certain extent. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated CAPS6 movie. It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. From books to videogames there are ratings and generes. If someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library. It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc inside a library. As long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem.",0
"Freedom of press is a right not many countries have. America is the land of the free. To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen. Without the freedom of press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist and their messages would be unknown. To censorize the right to write freely about ones outlook on the world or government or anything means taking away imagination and in some cases statistics and events that relate to the past.     Before todays technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge, and the process to make and publish a book took so long that it was an honor to recieve one of the few copies produced. People have a craving for information, they like to learn and advance. If all books that were found 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away and the enjoyment of reading would be gone.      In the brilliant novel, CAPS1 NUM1 a man who lives in a distopian society discovers the lack of literature. All books found in homes are immediatly taken out and burned in the streets for all to see. Children found it entertaining and adults did nothing. The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own. Once discovered he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public. Censorship would create nothing but chaos and distruction as in the novel.      Having the right to know about your countries history or what is going on in your current government is critical in shools and colleges. Parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are to single minded and wrong. Students need books to grow and learn and if every person chose one book to take off the shelf perminatly, there would be no more books. Eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good.      Books are a history in themselves, no one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavory or the possibility of a complete government take over. In order to avoid hearing of this one could simply chose a more ficition novel in which to escape into a fantasy of their own. No one can change history, however they can exagorate certain events and without the actual book or cite it came from, one could completely alter the publics view and thoughts of the past. Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it.      Writing is a gift few have naturally and to be able to show off ones talent is a privlage. Books help people escape the harsh world we live in, or help them gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrevelent, for having all forms of music, movies and magazines stripped of the truth, what does that leave? People always strech the truth or tell a 'white lie' however most information is factual. The freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people. The messages behind said 'offensive' material could be quite strong and though the author might be long gone, his or her message could live on for decades",0
"The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town. This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist.",0
"The Author of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, concluded hes story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note.

She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. I mean its not like the kind we had at  at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. (Ho, NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else.",0
"The author does an excellent job for creating many moods in this memoir. One of the moods, is love. Love is a mood in this memoir because PERSON1's parents took ten people who needed somewhere to stay, because they know that those people would do the same thing for them. Another example of love is when PERSON1 says in paragraph NUM1, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which, is another mood. It does this by having the author point out how little his house was, and how his parents did everything they could to give them a better life. It really makes one look back, and see how much their parents have done for them.",0
"Before reading about PERSON1 I don't think I read about anyone who is more happy than PERSON1. PERSON1 is very happy about being an CAPS1 citizen and still be very happy of having another country's background (in this case Cuba). PERSON1 was blessed that he had his house. It was in a great neighborhood and the kitchen was the main place of the house. PERSON1 was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house. PERSON1 was very happy about his parents, most of all. Without his parents he would have lived in Cuba and would not have known his great neighborhood and all of his family and friends.",0
"The mood in the memoir that the author creates is a very warm and relaxed sort of mood. The way the author tells you about his parents; the selflessness and the way they put their kids first before themselves really just makes you think about your own parents and how good they are to you and what they would do for you. The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden  red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with.  The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window. I love the mood that this memoir puts me in.",0

"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez and his mermoir is happiness. The author creates a very happy mood in this memoir. Here he describes how the people in his neighborhood acted towards each other. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" The people in his neighborhood were very kind and generous people. The help each other whenever one is in need. The author makes the reader smile when reading about such a place. Another example of this is when he writes, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To see such selfless act is just wonderful. The way the people sacrificed their lives for their child's is amazing. Reading about this just warms a person's heart. Another example proving this mood is when the author writes, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The author is very proud of where he grow. It MONTH1 not have been perfect but he managed to find the good parts. It is his pride that makes the readers feel happy for him. Thus, the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is happiness.",0
"The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards. The weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too. There were times when tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist.",0
CAPS1 were thought of as the future of transportation Also known as blimps CAPS1 were like ballons except they were steel and had rubbers and propellers to keep control. These steel balloons can ride eighty miles per hour. The main reason why the empire state building couldn't dock these was because most CAPS1 from outside the united states use hydrogen instead of hellium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and causes accidents.,0
"Books That Are Offensive     CAPS1 view point is that books should not be taken off the shelfs if taken offensive to one person. Sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book MONTH1 help the other person. Everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library. In a library everybody should have the right to read every book.     The idea of taking a book off the shelf is a bad because people want to read books like that. Some people have a problem with that type of book but if they don't like it then tell people not to read it not take it off the shelf. If anything put it in a different area or just move it put all that type of book in one area not mixed in.     When people need help they read a book or look it up. So if the book is offensive but can help somebody with problems then don't even move it. People do have a reason to read books that are offensive. We don't know all of the reasons but there are alot of them.     If a movie is not good for children or just very horid it MONTH1 need to be put in a place where nobody will look. Kids and grown ups are the same and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad.       Usually when somebody takes something offensive they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it. People think other people write things that are just offensive on purpose ,but they don't they write it and somebody is guilty if something and can not live up to it. Sometimes just the reading is read wrong and misunderstood.     Everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny. The biggest problem is some people can't read. then some people read so fast they do not comprehend it correctly.     I don't feel like them certain materials should be taken off the shelf if found offensive because that person MONTH1 be feeling guilty of something. If the materials should be moved they should just be moved to a different area not off of the shelves totally. If it is taken offensive they should tell the librarian and then if very many more people say it is offensive then it can be taken off the shelf.",0

"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one of the obstacles they faced were that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is significant because it would be dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their plan would not work. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to complete.",0

"Laughter, one of the wonderful things that we humans can enjoy. Laughter with friends, family, and with people we do not even know. We all can enjoy and share laughter, it is one of the amazing things that can bring us together no matter what ethnicity, age, gender, or disability. We all can enjoy it together, and no one can take it away from us. Laughter is simple, but yet complex in many ways. It is like falling into a pool of CAPS1. Laughter, just the word ""laughter"" brings me joy! When our days go sour laughter is there to sweeten it up. Where would we be without the wonders of laughter? Laughter, it is like a tool. It is the thing that has helped me make new friends. Also, laughter has helped me get out of conflicts from both friends and enemies. It has also aided me into achieving the things I want. Laughter is CAPS2 my middle school years. My family and I moved a lot, and every time I moved I had to make new friends. It got very difficult for me to make new friends every time I transferred to a new school. After I have settled down and got used to the surroundings of the new school I then started to make friends. I noticed that laughter was a key element on making people like you, and then later consider you to be what is known as a friend. After I have made new friends, and became very comfortable with my school the time to move came again. It gets difficult to make new friends, but its even harder when you have to leave the new friends you just made behind. After moving so much I just got used to making new friends, and later on laughter slowly became more like a tool than something that I should enjoy. A tool for just making friends. After I got into high school I just stopped trying to make new friends, because I felt that I knew I was going to make new friends, and then transfer to another school, and then start all over and make new friends again. I gave up trying and decided to get more involved in school and achieve good grades. Later in the year I felt like a kid with no friends, because I stopped trying. I decided to go and make new friends, but somehow it became a lot harder to make friends in high school than middle school. I tried to be the funny guy like I was in middle school, but I just didn't have it in me anymore. Also, when people get older the type of humor people enjoy changes. As time went by I realized that you don't have to make everyone laugh, so they can be your friend. It was about getting to now the person, and to be able to relate and to be a there when they needed you the most. Making friends at a new school is not easy, but it also is not very hard. All you got to do is be open to people and let them know who you are. This is what I learned about making friends. You can't make everyone laugh, because everyone has a different taste in humor. Humor and laughter are different from each other. Everyone has a different taste in humor, but we can all come together and have a good laugh. Laughter is wonderful. It is what puts people in a good mood. We as people MONTH1 have our differences, but we can still all laugh together. It feels very good when you get a good laugh, but its even better when you know that the person who made you laugh did it so you can be happy. We should not take laughter for granted for it is something that puts a smile on our faces.",0
"I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didnt even know that means, but if Im patient Ill probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it.",0

"In the article the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to herself that in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is bidding, then I will take that test again because the spring and the hibiscus reminds her of home. For example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much. So she finds things that reminds her of it like a plant called dok faeng-noi. Its not the real plant but she gets it to remind her where she comes from. In conclusion, Saeng finds a plant, she likes the soring because it reminds her home. How about what reminds you of home. Think about it.",0
"Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Libraries are given to people for new learning opportuites and for entertainment purposes. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, not two peoples are the same.     First of all when a person goes to the library they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner of the library. Therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out. What the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it. What is ment by this statement is that there are so many differnt types of writting that people are bound to not like something. So that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library.      If someone has gotten a book that seems to be to their type of book, but after they start to read it they find it offensive to them they should not just throw the book out all together, but they should take it back to the library and talk to the owner about it. People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is proporty of the library. So if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner let them know their concern, and try to have something done about it. In truth they will not be the only ones who have that oppionin. It takes one person to make the difference.      Books are not made for just one person they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy. People have their oppininons and will stick by them. Thats expected to happen with books, they are all different as are people. The society that everyone lives in is filled with people of diverse oppions and who are not afraid of expressing them. There is nothing wrong with expressisng them eigther, actually its better that way only because then others can hear about a book and eigther agree with that oppionoin or disagree, therefore finding out what type of writing do they really like.      Books yes can be thrown out by rights, but the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their oppionion. To spread an oppion is to let the world know wehre someone stands on a spacific topic. Without that the world would be just plain old boring having nothing to talk about because people would all share the same opinoin. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one.                                       ~~PERSON1",0
"Do Computers benfit the society? Yes, computers benefit the society. Computers give kids so much knowledge about things they would not be able to do or go in real life. Another thing is computers give kids a positive ego or entertainment. Also computers let other kids interact with each other like facebook, or CAPS1. There are many good details why computers are good for the society. First, when most kids dont know an answer to question they can go on google to fing the answer. Which helps in most cases. Also when on google, or any ""CAPS2 CAPS3"" it gives kids the chance to CAPS2 anything and most likly get arreasonable answer. Kids can CAPS2 up facts about other countries, famous people, and even types of pets! Another benefit of having computers is most kids on the internet go to have fun or entertain themselves, which could lead to a positive ego or better self-convidence. Just because kids arent going outside to have fun, doesnt mean they cant have fun inside either. Third, parents or any gauriden always talk about there kids or would like to see them with friends. Well having thing such as facebook and CAPS1 or CAPS5 you can make new friend around the town or even other CAPS6. The internet can do all of those things. Finally do computers benefits society? Yes computers do benefits society, they can give you alot of knowledge, make new friends and to just let kids be kids. As you can see computers do benefit the society.",0
"have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computors are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves 'CAPS1"" or ""CAPS2"" their friends and colleges. This is causing many bad-habit forming. People are it more to talk to physically, and might even be using terms like ""CAPS3"" and ""CAPS4"" instead of works. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social-wonangs of humans, and is harming them more know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelieveable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or ""CAPS5"" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computor. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent polls shows that that average person from ages NUM1 spreads over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wastedon computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use or computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computors watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computors to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on facebook or oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than it I feel this way because of the social-flow it is teaching people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are. If the average person tried! to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive in their life-style!",0
"Censorship in libraries!Do you believe that certianmaterials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?NO!, I do not think they should be removed. I believe everyone is intitled to there own opinion, CAPS1 if something is offensiv eto one person CAPS2 MONTH1 not be to another. No one thinks the same or has the same opinion about somethings thats why there is a variety of books, music, movies etc. If you take out the 'offensive' things, CAPS2 MONTH1 cause offense to another.People just need to stop being sefish and understand everyone is different and we all have different interests",0
"I think computer technogily is good. I think there are mang good effects on computers. I think the computer teaches us to work onlone with no ones help. Another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online. Also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. Another reason is it gives us hand cordanation. All of those are the reasons why I think the computer has good effects. My first topic, why I think there are good effects on the computer is we can do work by ourselves with no ones help. My first reason why I think that is because after looking up links on it and getting use to that homework would be eaiser. Also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade. Another reason is that you will be able to work onlone you will be able to get it done faster by going on the web. My second topic why there good effects is that you can go online and talk to freinds. My first reason why I think that because if you don't have a cell phone and you wanna talk to friends you can go online. Another reason is that is good is that if you can't do somthing and our in a bind you can tell the person that you can't. Also another reason it is good because you can talk to relatives you havent seen. My last two topics are that it gives good hand cordination and we can learn to surf the web. It gives us good hand cornation because we learn how to use our hands and fingers faster. Also it gets us away from typeing. You can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master. Lastly you will be able to find everything you look for. In conculsion these are good effects. The computer teaches us how to type, and search on the web and learn about it. As you can see these are the reasons I think it has good effect.",0
"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so. Saeng took a test and failed and in the winter, flowers fail but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again. Moving can be a hardship especially when it is to place very unfimiliar. People find ways to make themselves promises & to remind them of their old home.",0

"I believe computers are a huge benefit to society. I myself have a computer; it is very important and useful to me. Over PERCENT1 of the families in our town own at least one computer. Computers are a great source of information. They also allow you to talk to people, even if they are far away. They are also very convenient and easy to use, in mu opinion. Based on these positives, CAPS3't you agree with my opinion? Computers are a great source of information. Unlike books, which you must find and buy, there is an enormous amount of information just a mouse click away! With computers, you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them. Let me compare this to a book. Let's say you wanted to do research on PERSON1. You would have to go to the library and search for a book about him. And what would you do if you couldn't find one about him? With a computers you could type ""CAPS2 of PERSON1"" into a search engine and receive of information in under a minute! I love saving time, and computers help me do that. They also augment the information I use. Another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to other, no matter where their location is. Email is extremely faster than writing a letter. having to pay to travel. Who CAPS3't like that? Computers are very convenient. You can surf the internet, talk to people, and much more from the comfort of your bedroom. There are jobs that you can do from home on a computer. No need to go anywhere to work. My uncle is one of those people. He is s stockbroker, and operates his whole job from the computer in his house. It is a convenient and a well-paying job. I asked him what he thought of his job. He said, ""I love my job because I can work when I want to work, and from the comfort of my home."" CAPS3't you want to have his job? I would most definately. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial to us. Did you know computers were first invented by ORGANIZATION1 to perform calculations that were very long? Look at what they have involved into DATE1. They bring us information at amazing speeds. They let us talk to people all over the world. They are very convenient. These are major benefits to society, and everybody should embrace computers.",0
"Should certaine materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves? I believe that certaine materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves. These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people.     Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person MONTH1 not be offensive to another person. People take things differently than other people might. For example, a lady might find a book to be disturbimg or offensive, while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him. Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing.     I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look, purchase, or give attention to that object that is there on the shelve. He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them. The material that is offending that person is not purposley put there to offend them, it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy theresleves in whatever it is that they might be doing.     Therefore I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves. People have the right to things that they enjoy. A material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it. Different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things.",0
"Based on the excerpt given, the idea for allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical. One obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen a highly flamable gas rather than helium like a balloon. This raises safety issues for the urban city. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to violent winds and the risk of destruction. The mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction.",0
"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. D     CAPS1 you know that there is more than CAPS5 radio station? Well, CAPS3 you do. Not just CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books.  CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put CAPS4 down. CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well.     Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever CAPS4 is down and move on.  Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away.      Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example look at the PERSON2 ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work.      I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and CAPS4 helped me out, CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do.      I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see CAPS4 sometime in theirlives.      Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check.  Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, 'CAPS2, I'm never going there.' CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say.     If CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me.      This makes me think of drama. People say they hate CAPS4, but no matter what, CAPS4's everywhere, and CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come?  You must learn to deal with CAPS4.     Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and PERSON1 book when there is a ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see CAPS4. Not all of the world will care to see CAPS4. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.'      CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. CAPS4's like the saying, 'CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like CAPS4, you might even hate CAPS4. But once CAPS4's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with CAPS4.     I think that just because someone picks up a book and CAPS4 offends them, CAPS4 doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves. Grow up, put whatever CAPS4 is that offends you down, and walk away.",0

"In life you have the 'offensive things'. The little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us.  No it is not easy to get over ,but these things will make you stronger. Sometimes there are books, magazines, music and movies  that offened us. The only reason why we get offensive is because the subject either reflects our personality, or our life. It's not the authors fault, they write what they feel and what is the truth.          Okay, so libraris are full of book's, movies, music, etc. You can't just take books off the shelves, just because they offened you. Other people MONTH1 like the book you hate. There are more books in the library you can read.           Another reason people shouldn't remove offensive material out of the library; it will hurt whoevers' company got the book published and also the writters. Writters and publishers would lose so much money because the library sells' there books,magazines, movies. They make thousands of copies of thier product, which takes money. So to make thier money back ,they sell to thousands of book stores.           Must of the offensive material will open the worlds eye's. Everybody needs to see whats going on in the world. Books, newspapers tell the truth about a subject. Now the writters intent is'nt to hurt you but to help you. Why cant the world be more open?          I know in my own life i have read books that at first ,the book offended me. I would get so mad, i would put the book down and walk away. But then,my eyes would open and finaly it hit me.  The offensive part out of the book helped myself relives a new understanding. The views i used to have would be gone. It is strange how you finnaly open up, and your life changes.     Some people might even find this paper offensive. But if nobody is stepping on your toes, and getting under your skin you wont ever change. Offened is a word used lightly; yes, people use it a lot but do they really mean it. Some people need to use 'well this book bugs me'. Stop being about yourselves and get over it. Life is to short to worry and feel offended.      Every single book, magazine,movie and music needs to be left alone. Those materials MONTH1 reflect other peoples life and help others with thiers'. Just read another book, or watch a different move. Please do not remove anything from the selves, because it will only do more damage",0

The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how like the flower Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in LOCATION1.

"I have same questions for you and I was hoping you could answer them. I was wandering. Do you have any computers in your house, if so how many? Also, do you like using the computer? I am trying to figure out how many people don't use computers because. I want to ask them how do they survive without one!? Computers are essential to our present day lives. Everything in the world is in one computer. You can talk, email, even see people through a computer because now adays everyone has a videcam hooked onto their computer. I want to tell you all of the great things computers do not make our lives so much easier. People are always looking for a way to get in touch with someone like if your phone is dead, how are you going to tell your friend what time your going to meet at that place? You can easily just text her from the computer. You can either use your screen-name to text someone or just go on verizon, at&t, sprine... etc.com and text people from there. It would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it. Has there ever been a time where you needed number, but you couldn't find your telephone book? It sure has happened to me, but you know what I do? I go on the computer and go on yellow pages.com and just look up the restrauntplace on the website. It's as simple as that. You can look up almost anything on the computer, prices, places, facts, anything! Most of the time the true facts will always be there. Computers help you a lot if you need help on histicoral, scientific, and CAPS2 facts. Computers help us everyday. People need them for communication, telephone numbers, or facts about anything. Most of someones life can be saved to the computer. If you have bad handwriting, then you could just type up your paper and hand it in all nice and neat.

"The computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde haired girl filled the screen. It was easy to find out how life was in LOCATION2, thanks to the actual CAPS1 girl explaining it. Going to the library wouldn't have filled one with this priceless information and human interection. Computers are a nessessity of life if soceity wishes to grow and expand. They should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online. Firstly, computers help teach hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is a useful ability that is usod to excel in sports. In a recent survey, PERCENT1 of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use. Even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill. Famous neurologist CAPS2 PERSON1 stated in an article last week that, ""CAPS3 and computer strength the CAPS2. When on the computer, you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands."" CAPS4 hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball. If someone wan't to become better in these sports, all they'd need to do was turn on the computer. Once people become better at sports, they're more likely to play them and become more healthy. In reality, computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it. Additionaly, computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people. If someone wanted to reasearch LOCATION1, all they'd need to do was type in a search would be presented to them in it would link forever to search through countless things. Also, having the ability to learn about cultures can make peole peole and their cultures, they understand others something. Increase tolerance people are. Computers are a resourceful tool that they can help people in every different aspect of life. Lastly, computer and in technology can allow people to chat. Computer chat and video chat can help the all different nations. Bring on good terms places other than can help us understand story comes out about something that happend in LOCATION3, people can just go on their computer and ask an actual LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter. Also, video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills. No one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy. Another good point is that you can acess family members you scaresly visit. It can help you connect within your own family more. Oviously, computers are a useful aid in todays era. their advancements push the world foreward to a better place. Computers can help people because they help teach handeye coordination, give people the bility to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with others. Think of a world with no computers or technologicall advancements. The world would be sectored and unified, contact between people scare, and information even. The internet is like thousands or librarys put together. Nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower. Is that the kind of palce you want people to live in?",0

"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attemply to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the reading they talk about how there is not much landing area in ORGANIZATION2 but, although adding space for landing The height of the mast would be dangerous, not only for passengers but for those who were on ground level.

"Al Smith faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles dock on the mast on top of the Empire State building. The first problem him and the architects faced was they couldnt just put the mast on top of the building's flat roof. The mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the dirigibles load and the wind would add stress. Another reason was safety. Most dirigibles used Hydrogen which was highly flammable. Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents. The winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move. Lastely, the dirigibles couldnt fly near the building because there was a law against air crafts flying to low over urban areas which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast anyways.",0
ear CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3: Computers have a negitive affect on people and their to connect with others because they always are on the computer and never outside. My first reason is that computers hurt your eyes after a long time sitting at them. People I know have complained of their eyes hurting after using the computer. Studys show taht PERCENT1 of all people who use the computer after a long time are more likly to loose their eye sight than people who are outside all day. Another one of my reasons is people who are inside on electronics all day are less likly to have good people skills. If you don't have good people skills then you probibly wont have alot of friends and if you need them it would probibly be over the computer. And you never know what they could be like. Also if your inside all day then you will not get the proper excersize could be very bad you and others. My third and final reason is that people will makes fun of you if you sit inside all day don't come out because your on the computer. If you ar on the computer you are more likly to fail in school you don't do your homework or projects but instead your on the computer playing games. And your more likly to get into fights with your parents or guardians because your on the computer and they never see you or hear from you. Also they wont be able to go online and pay their bills witch could be bad for everyone. So these are just some of the reasons I think computers could be bad. Thank you.,0
"I belive certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because even if offensive people still have the right to acess that information. I make this opinion by the guidlines our country was built on, freedom of speech and equality for everyone. If we started removing books, movies etc. from out of our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not? To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture, would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think, wouldn't you?. Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people too learn and teach, they arn't made to be offensive or rude and in my experience with libraries being a NUM1+ year user I have never found anything to be offesive or hurtful to anyone.In my conclusion there are just too many books about to many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and too whom. In conclusion to that libraries are a place of leaning and teaching and the information inside is ment to be helpful and constructive not offesive or hurtful and to start removing materials now would eventualy lead to the end of libraries.",0
"We all have our favorite books and some we like others MONTH1 not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maby a book a friend recomended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are are bookes that are well liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away.     To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial shurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like PERSON1 for example, MONTH1 be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future.     Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has there prefrence on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others MONTH1 not. If all books that are bad or offencive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendus it MONTH1 be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them.     I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want",0
The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.,0
"Censorship in libraries? That could be a good and a bad thing. Is it really that big of a deal for kids to see some bad things in books? Will authors remove their books from libraries?     Censorship in Libraries is not as needed as most people think. Children now a days know a lot of things and are intelligent about certain subjects. I understand parents dont want their children to read books containing drugs, CAPS1, sex, etc. Their going to have to learn about it sometime in their life though. They might as well get ahead start on it now. Young children most of the time are not even interested in going to those kinds of books anyway. If you censor all the books in the libraries then some students would be in trouble on projects they MONTH1 need those kinds of books for. Say I needed a book on 'CAPS1' for a project im doing in CAPS2 class. If the books are censored then I would have no sources to get information from.     On the other hand, I can see why adults would want the books censored. No parent wants their child coming home from school talking about sex, and drugs they saw in a book at school. If I was a parent I would be concerned myself. If it's that big of a deal to some adults then what are they going to do when their children see the same stuff only worse on t.v. Commercials about condoms, and advertisements telling them to use drugsCAPS1. Atleast with books, the book is teaching you about the drug and how dangerous it is for you.      If one author takes their book off the shelf because they don't want children reading it, then that gives all authors to do the same. Which could mean that we would have no books on the shelves for anybody. Books are a key to learning! We need to keep ALL books in the libraries no matter how explicit they are. Parents should sit down and talk with their children about not picking up those kinds of books if they don't want their child reading them. Yes, I have seen people pick those books up and start making jokes about them, but thats what children do when their immature. You have to expect that from kids now a days. No matter how bad they are their informational books and we need them to learn",0
"PERCENT1 of CAPS1 own computer. This illustrates that computers must have an positive effect on people if most people own them. I believe computers do have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online, learn about new things, and gives you hand eye coordination. My first reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online. Some people dont have phones but do have computers. If you needed to contact somebody you could do it using a computer. Also some people have family and friends who live across the world. Computers are great for keeping in touch, it also wont cost you a lot for long distance, like phones would. Because computers give you the ability to talk to friends, family, and other people it is a positive thing because it is important to do so. My second reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ablity to learn about new things. Learning about new things using a computer gives a positive effect on people because you dont have to travel and go places to get information to learn about things. You could do by a click of a button. People could use the computer to learn about anything or everything. Being able to not have to leave your home to gather information about new things gives a positive effect on people because now more people will be able to learn more because they have more time than they would traveling places to get information. This is a positive effect on people because the more you know the better. Having a lot of knowlage is a good thing and will do good things for you in the future. My third reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination. Having hand and eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because your going to need it through out live. If you dont have good hand and eye coordination, it is a bad thing because you use it for just about every thing, such as driving, writing, and excercizing. Computers give you the ablity to learn eye and hand coordontion throughout life which is why it is a posite thing for people. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ablity to talk online to people, learn about new things and teaches you hand and eye coordination. I hope this letter persades you to believe that computers do have a positive effect on people.",0
"Computers is a good benefit for people. First, computer is a helpful machine in diffrent ways, like I personally go on computer and check for my homework with it. Computer is also good because whenever you dont know something, you can just go on the internet and search it. Computers won't effect out health if we dont use it for a long time, computers could help students making project. By using word, exell and other microsoft ware. So I think computers are a great machine for people to have. Secondly, using computer could also socialize with people, many students inculding me uses face book, so even if we are not right next to each other, we can still talk. Computers could be used to make new friends too, but their is people you dont know and we are not surpose to give out our information. said PERSON1 our health teacher. Computers could be useful to friends that live far away, if your friend moved to another state, you could use computer to chat with him, their is many ways to social with computers. Lastly, exercising is important to everyone, but using computers doesnt mean we can not go outside and exersice anymore, maybe computers are addictive, but if you keep track of time and maybe use the computer for - half an hour at a time, you can still get the exercise you need. Exercising is an easy thing to do, children likes to exercise so their sould not be a problem, like my nabor alway come over to my house and ask if I want to play football while I was talking with someone on the computers but I still went outside and play, so computer is a great machine thats not very addictive so parents doesnt have to worry about children exercising. I think computers have great effects on people, like going online to do a research or talk to friends. Grown ups need them to work. So that proves computer is a great machine.",0
"The memoir looks back on his childhood, with fondness, so I'd call the mood whistful. Yes, the author creates a whistful mood, by talking about his childhood home, friends and family. But... whistfulness only lasts until the end of paragraph NUM1... after that it becomes a greatful mood, where he's giving out thanks and describing what his parents went through. If it is possible to have two moods, then this memoir does. The moods are both whistful and greatful. Yes.",0
"Censorship can be a very good thing. It keeps inapropriate material from falling into the wrong hands. It also keeps the horrors that are in the sensored material out of the community and that makes the community a better environment to live in. But too much censorship can become a bad thing. For instance ORGANIZATION1 had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning all of those books. There also several books that talk about the censorship idea getting out of hand like the book CAPS1 NUM1. Libraries should censor some of there material.      Books and magazines need to be censored according to there content. Books and magazines both use words and sometimes pictures to get there point across. If a book is using vulgar and inapropiate language in should be in some way censored. With this in mind I should not be able to pick a book and open it to find sexual dialog. I also shouldn't be able to find the constant use of swear words in a book or magazine. Also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of gore. Magazines and books also use pictures to help get there point across. If there are inapropriate pictures in either of the two sources that material should be censored. If I am walking through my local library and just see a magazine sitting ou with a nude picture on the front I'm going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Another example would be that I pick up a book and start looking through it and it has an inapropiate picture in it, I am going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Also if a magazine has an extremly violent picture or extremely gorey picture it should be cnesored. Overall if a book or magazine is extremely inapropriate, then it should be, in some way, censored.     Music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored. Musicians use artwork on the album sleeves to grab the attention of people. If that artwork includes swear words or inapropriate pictures it should be in some way or shape be censored. Musicians also play music of course. But if the lyrics to there songs are explicit or has many sexual themes it has to be conesored. Someone should have to deal with wading through music like that. No matter what, if an album of music is out of this world inaproiate, it should be censored.     Movies are most likely the hardest things to sensor. This is because they use language, pictures, music, and video. Movies are multi-media monsters that can sometimes be very clean, and sometimes be very inapropriate. If a movie is rated CAPS2 it should not be in a public library. Movies that are rated CAPS3 for seual content, nudity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or swearing should be censored. A kid should not be able to get his hands on that kind of stuff in a public library. Also depending on how violent and a gorey a movie is it should be cenesored. Movies that are inapropiate, especially ones rated CAPS3, should be censored.     The fact that this debate even needs to happen is sad. But it does so we must censor certain things that people MONTH1 get a offended by if they saw it in there public library. Things containing nudity, sexual content, swear words, gore, and violence to possibaly be censored. There also needs to be a line where we stop sensoring or pretty soon, just like Katherine Paterson said we won't have any books left. But overall there needs to be some type of censorship in public libraries.",0

"I have been infromed that people don't get to talk to friendsfamily, enjoy nature and exercise because of computers. Well computers benefit our life. The first thing about computers is communication. People can use CAPS2, CAPS3, CAPS4 and etc. The social networking groups are for abilities to talk to friends, long distance or close and family enjoy research. Just because CAPS11 use those internet websites doesn't mean CAPS11 can't go outside and enjoy activities. This leads to other objects called peortables. As technology advances so does our skills. Every year more electronics are made and most likely are portable such as CAPS5, CAPS6 phones, CAPS7, and etc. Many of these companies let us take these devices to allow as to do everyday things. With ORGANIZATION1 creater of the CAPS8 CAPS11 can use this internetmusic CAPS9 for everything. for example, I visit my grandparents and I decied to my CAPS6 phone. I can talk to friends on my CAPS6 phone by texting and visit my grandparents. More of this opplies to and CAPS5 CAPS11 still all go outside and enjoy life. exercise is something CAPS11 should yet to. If you stay cramed in your house CAPS12 fun. CAPS11 need to cheer up and go outside and play sports. CAPS11 could get included in and join activity. CAPS11 also can have videos online to show us how to exercise or use yoga. Most of use portables which goes back to my last paragraph. Exercise is big and CAPS11 all should do it. What I'm trying to say here CAPS11 can use computers and electronics and exercise with fun one in all. If you understand experts can agree and kids could be healthier and still communicate.",0
"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,when the snows melt and the geese return this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, when this hibiscus is budding,""  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.  Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement.",0

"The effects computers have an people are not good. They can cause many problems in your life. When your on a computer, are you running? No, your just sitting there; using the computer involves very little movement. You need to be jumping around, dancing, walking with your friends, something! You can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day. Another problem that computers give you is being non social. You can get addicted to a game or something like facebookCAPS1 and be on there all the time. You wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer. You are always thinking about just that and no other things in life. Computers can also be very dangerous. If you are on something where you are talking to people you don't know, they can find out things about you and can do to you. It's not at all to talk to people you don't know online. These are or the many problems computers cause. Trust me, I got addicted to a game before.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock. At first I thought it was a great idea, then realized there were obstacles. First obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (Lüsted). This was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of people would be hurtkilled. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. The dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (Lüsted). One other reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building Two tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. The Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach.",0
"What do you go to the library for?  In earlier times libraries used to be the place where you went to study.  They were no computers, and so you had to go look up your work in a educational book at the library.  Is that truly what people are doing at the libraries now, or are people there to look at vulgar books, magazines, and movies?       A library is meant to be the place where you can go to work in peace and have a helpful resource of educational books.  But, now you can go to the library and be tempted to look at books you shouldn't be looking at.  Instead you could be on the computer the whole time playing games of some sort.  The possibilites are endless.  People now could go to the library and check out a magazine, movie, or book on: pornagrophy, drugs, achlocol, or worse.  Is that really what you want your kid to accidently pick up at the library?  Presonally I myself witnessed a little kid pick up a porn magazine at the library, and his mom had to grab it very fast before he had the chance to look at the magazine.     The library should not be used for this, and the treat of young kids accidently looking at these materials should not be happening in the library.  The music some one could listen is also very bad, and your child could listen to that.  Then what if they want to keep listening to it?  Yes, the world does have a huge impact on what is put into the library; because, drugs, sex, scandals, and achlocol seem to be what most teenagers are intereseted in at some point in their young life.  But a library is a community building and there is no stopping some one from coming in and easily getting these vuglar things.  The thoughts of the youth is completely swayed after they watch, read, or listen to this.  And, this needs to be controled.  Women and children can find all of these materials offensive.  These materials need to be censored more then what the are right now.     Libraries should be a safe place where people can go to study or get a book, and not to be tempted to look at something they should not be looking at.  Many people find this offensive.  Yes, in the end libraries are a great place, but the people who do not use libraries for the right reasons are why these materials need to be censored at the libraries",0
"In my opinion, I think computers do benefit society. One reason is because people can learn about new things, it makes life a little easier then it is, and lastly, people can meet new people while they're on the computer. First off, we can benefit from computers because we can learn new things. People can find places that they've never heard of, or they can see whats going on in the world. Computers can help kids that are in school who want to learn new things. Computers help you find out important information that you might need to know in the future. Secondly, having computers in our society can make life a little easier for some people. On computers, you can order things from online websites instead of trying to go out and buy them. For people with no transportation, this'll help make their lives a little easier than it is. Or, for example, if a person wants to buy something that isn't in stores yet, they can go online, and they might have it up there. Lastly, having computers can help you meet new people. If someone just moved from another town or state, this will help them meet new people. Or if a student doesn't know anybody from their new school, they might find them online and then they'll be able to get to know each other. In conclusion, computers help our society in a lot of ways. They can help us learn new things, we all can meet new people. and computers can make our live s a little easier. Thats whay I think we should keep computers in our society.",0
"CAPS1 think if you had to get a book for every question you had. That would take a long time to even get the book let alone read it. Computers have helped the modern world with questions, long distance friends, and entertainment. Computers have helped us with more then those things the CAPS2 is sucha universal thing that its hard to come up with all of the helpful things it does. For one the CAPS2 helps us stay in contact with our friends that are far away without talking on the phone with them. Sites like CAPS3 and CAPS4 allow us to communicate andor play with them. CAPS1 think is the only way to talk with a friend from a different place would be to pick up the phone and call them well your friendship would disappear very quickly. This would happen because no one ever usualy has the time to pick up the phone and talk to the person and do nothing else. Well when you talk to them on the CAPS2 you can do other things. For example if I wanted to I could talk to someone and the CAPS2 and clean my room. Further more computers allow us to play games or watch funny videos or any else that is entertaining. On the to do I when my brother would let me use the play again. I was but them I CAPS1 went better A also play movies, CAPS5 shows videos. If you ever miss a show to watched home of the show and watch it. This could save someone time and effort. Lastly, The computers much more efficient is looking yet things. IT is much faster then looking through the library and you don't have leave your I although people say that the CAPS2 is taking away time from reading well it really isn't it. For everything you want you can read online or if you really want to you can have the CAPS2 don't for you. Reading isn't a problem at all. NUM1 of america believes that computers help greatly and how they have more time to do things is being upgraded every day and it keeps getting better and better. In conclusion I believe that computers are helping us and is not a bad thing. Computers are great for us and good for bussy people. Now go and get a CAPS2 to.",0
"One in a land called CAPS1 bokane there was a young named  PERSON2. In the land of CAPS2, all the people lived off the land.

CAPS6 stared  at him. Unblinking pupils dialated. Snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet PERSON2 did not take the shot.

At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, Know the best way to get there? The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist told the man yes, sir: I own a very good map.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A few of these problems included designing the mast and making sure that it was safe enough for dirigible to dock on. According to the excerpt, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles. After they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play. Stated in paragraph NUM1, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" Another big safety issue was ""nature itself."" ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The air currents made it so that they had to tie down the dirigible, but even then it is dangerous because it would be dangling over pedestrians on the street. The design and safety of the building both were big obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",0
"Everyone likes to watch movies, jam to some music, and get lost in an interesting book. Therefore everyone should be able to read, watch, or listen to what they want and the same things as other people are reading, listening to, and watching. Some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project. Other people just MONTH1 be entertained by certain peices of liturature, or music. In that case, why censor certain things that people are interested in, or even things to research, in libraries?     Many people enjoy violent writing or gorey movies. Reading these things also amusses them. So why take away what they like? If a library takes certain books off of their shelves, then they could be taking away a type of literature that people are interested in. If one removes a book that twenty people take pleasure in reading, then thats twenty people that are not going to want to read anything else. People are different in many ways. That includes the variety of things humans are interested in. For example, things they are interested to read. Humans having a major differences in characteristics, meaning they don't enjoy all the same things. The articles, magazines, or movies MONTH1 be not suited for schools or libraries, but if it's a topic people like, or if it's someone needs for a project, then there is no reason to get rid of it.     Some books offten offend certain groups or races of people, but the book gets it uniqueness from what it says. Some books are writen in times of racisim. This shuold'nt make a book worth critisizing because that was the way things were said in that time. It allows the book to give off a feeling of living in the time is based in. On the other hand, some magazines are writen about horrible events and wars, but people find entertainment in reading about these events going on in the world. They want to know what is really happening across seas or even around home. Someone isn't able to know what's happening is no one lets him or her read the magazine.     Authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them. Due to the wide veriety of interest people have, there are many different types of writings. People should'nt have their favorite book taken off shelves just to see that the guy right next to him found the book he loves. That just would'nt be fare. Libraries should put on the shelf what people write, so that others MONTH1 enjoy them.",0

"The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new sorrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted. Saeng feels like she could adapt to her new surroundings with the comfort of her memories of her old life.",0
"A very wise man in CAPS1 life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' CAPS1 CAPS2, PERSON2, while growing up had poor influences all around him. CAPS4 went to a run-down school, lived in a crime torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a CAPS2, had no mother around to help him and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically. As CAPS4 grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him. CAPS4 had no example of how to behave, yet CAPS4 stayed away from CAPS3, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as 'minor' as pornography.      As I have been growing up with CAPS1 CAPS2 as a hard working individual and having CAPS1 mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed. Just before I was born, CAPS1 parents moved out of the old crime riden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter. We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdimeaners. CAPS1 CAPS2 told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, fowl language was un heard of in songs and music but now-a-days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape! At this rate I'm scared of the thought of what you're kids are going to see, son.' CAPS4 had a valid point. In our curent days the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talkes about killing law enforcement officers.      What has the world come to when a child of age eight MONTH1 walk into a public library and check-out a book on cocaine? The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out. A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf that we should just remove the book from the shelf and CAPS5 have the book there at all.      Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel thretened or endangered. Well what if CAPS1 CAPS2 as a parent feels thretened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by todays society that they are even found in the public library? Then what? Public libraries and other public resourcess should be controled and monitored about what they allow into their doors. A parent SHOULD CAPS5 have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inapropriot topic while in public but should know that that is CAPS5 the case. Parents should be able to relax and rest asured that their child is safe from the filth of inmoral things",0
"The mood that the author created in the memoir is a very loving and caring one. This is because the author tells what his parents gave up just for him to have a good life. That means his parents really loved him because they wanted him to grow up and have a good life. And that was something that they could find in LOCATION1. It is very caring of them because when they moved to LOCATION1 not only did they look after their baby, but other people that needed help as well. To them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other. The mood is really both loving and caring because it shows how an group of people are so close, that they love and care for each other as one family. No matter what even in hard times one of them will always have their door open for them, and they can always relay on them. That is what family is about.",0
"Laughter I've always been one who laughs a lot. It does not take much effort for me to bust out in a laughing fit, the topic doesn't even need to be that funny. I'm not the type to do the ""nervous laugh"" though. I think my laugh fits me well because I am quiet, just like my laugh. I always get a little embarrassed when my laugh gets louder than usual.  The weather lately has been very cold with snow falling here and there. I have just been itching for some good, warm swimming weather. This past weekend my boyfriend, PERSON1, and I went up to the mountains to play in the deep snow. After a few hours of being up in the snow we headed back down the mountain to go to his house and use his hot tub.Obviously it was very cold and me, being more of a fair weather girl, just wanted to go somewhere to warm up. First we stopped by my house so i could grab my swim suite that I recently ordered off line and was dying to use it.  We left our clothes in the back room and ran out in the cold to get in the hot tub on his back patio. The hot water felt so good; it relaxed my body of ice and my tense muscles. We were in the hot tub for about forty five minutes before we noticed how hungry we were. Since we had gotten all warmed up we decided CAPS1 sounded good. We jumped out of the hot tub and ran for the back room to dry off and get our clothes on. I had gotten all dried off and started to put my jeans back on. When I put my first leg in my jeans I just had a feeling that I was going to fall. Sure enough, when I got my second leg half way in the other side I lost my balance, tripped over a huge exercise machine, and fell hard on my butt. I started busting out laughing, along with PERSON1, I was a bit embarrassed but at least it didn't hurt too bad. After I had gotten up and walked around for a few minutes my butt started to hurt more and more.  PERSON1 kept making jokes about me falling, even though they were pretty funny, I tried not to laugh. He was facing me while we were having a conversation, when we were done talking he turned towards the door to leave and hit his head square on the exact same exercise machine I had tripped over just minutes before. Instantly, I was bent over laughing. I could not move, I was laughing to hard. It looked like it had to hurt when he hit his head, he had a nice red bump under his eye. He didn't find it nearly as funny as I did and just walked out the door. Still, laughing hysterically I tried to follow him out the door but it was hard to move from laughing so much. My stomach was hurting from all the laughing when it finally started to subside.  Still having a little giggle left in me, I walked to his pickup to wait for him while he was talking to his dad. When I turned around to see if he was coming I started laughing again just seeing him walking to the pick up. The look on his face when he seen me laughing again was just priceless. I could imagine why I looked ridiculous to him; sitting all by myself in his pickup laughing hysterically again.  Laughter is one of the very few things in this world that is free. Everybody's laugh is unique and can change due to the situation. There are many different laughs a person can have such as nervous, happy, giddy, and so on. If people can share a laugh it can bring them together. Through out the world laughter is a universal sign of happiness. People of any age, race, or religion can share a laugh. Over all, laughter is just a great feeling.",0
"Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was of the the challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical, ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement of the talking has yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues, "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""-this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been unsured yet, that it was still a challenge the builders faced area altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety.",0
The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring.,0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it connects the hibiscus back to the trials and triumphs of saeng . Just how saeng cant give up .and must go back to retake the test, the winter hibiscus must make it through the hard, rough winter and come back strong . The hibiscus are a symbol of hope and saeng thinks of them as her hope. Throughout the story, the hibiscus are comforting to saeng because they remind her of home. The author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things.  For saeng, knowing that each year the hibiscus will come back in those conditions, reassures her that shell be okay there as well.",0
"The features of the setting in this story, Do not exceed Posted Speed limit, affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through California in a desert-like area. It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, wide rings of sweat circled my shirt. The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.",0

"In my opinion, censorship of any kind shouldn't exist, especially in libraries.           Libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book, CAPS1, magazine, or movie. It's where the poor can have access to the same materials the better off have. If you take away opinions in books, music, film or magazinenewspaper articles, then you're taking away the author's right to freedom of speech just because someone deemed it offensive.           The right to free speech is an important one in the LOCATION1, we can have opinions here, we can choose our beliefs, and if someone wants to share their beliefs and opinions by form of writing, then they should be allowed.          Writing is a form of expression, writers can express their thoughts, use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters. Who does one think they are to say it's offensive? Who gets to decide that this book of movie is offensive?          If we take away books that one person finds 'offensive', we wouldn't have anything to read. Some people MONTH1 find the CAPS2 offensive, but we still put that in libraries, some people MONTH1 find books on wizardry and vampires offensive, yet those are all rage now, we wouldn't take those away.     Things that people find offensive are just opinions--just like the ones of those of the writers. It just simply wouldn't work out--if you want young people to read, you have to give them something to read that will stimulate their interests, and sometimes that MONTH1 be 'offensive.",0

"Have you ever thought about all the intresting things you can do on computers such as call people, order groceries, and read books for school. Today it seems like the world is held together by technology and I think computers are at number one. ""CAPS1 my older sister moved to CAPS2 it was hard to keep intuch and see eachother, but we found out about ORGANIZATION1, which is a site where people all over can add people and chat, call, or webcam eachother, so we do that everyday and it's like she never left home."" PERSON2 says about the internet site ORGANIZATION1. CAPS4 sure PERSON2 and a lot of others love their computers. Studies show that NUM1 out of NUM2 people get more done in the day online PERSON1 says ""everyday my day is shortened because my CAPS3 because while at work I can order my groceries and have them delivered by four o clock CAPS1 I arive home from work I can make doctor apt, school apts and schedul meetings all with one touchclick where ever I go, instead of looking on the calander or picking up the phone. PERCENT1 of couples today say they met online via twitter, facebook, myspace or aol. The internet is great for meeting new people because you CAPS4 eachother and get to know one another or look at their profile pictures and things. You cand find peolple just like you online and after a while the two of you are friends. I have some of my best friends online through a mutual friend's page and it's a sucessful friendship today. Even schools took education to the web, with all books from a class avalible at home online. Students can even check grades online now and recieve comment from teachers. So now students are pushed to use the web at home and at school. I hope I have opened your mind a little to understand the internet is not all bad, and people spend so much time on them now because everything has moved to the web like school, stores, food, even tv you name it the web has it. Personaly I spend about an hour or two on the web chating, studying, watching tv. After I might go walk or play my CAPS5 but i'll still conected to the web because the CAPS5 picks up on wi-fi connections. So I think computers let you open up and connect with others and get other things done on the web. I hope by now you feel the same",0
"Desert, Hills and road condition and lack of water all are how the setting affected the cyclist. First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, I was trave ling throug the high deserts of california in June. This means it was hot.

The cyclist reveals this when he describes, flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, aid againg  It read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, He had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then figured out the needed to conserve it but by then it was too late.

"Libraries            CAPS1 are many libraries throughout the LOCATION1 that stock their shelves with materials such as books, magazines, music and movies. Libraries do have a purpose I must say, having a library gives out the information that you can't find elsewhere. Just think CAPS1's a huge variety of everything you might need all in one place. Certain materials such as magazines and movies that are rated CAPS2 for instance, should be placed elsewhere on the shelves immediately. If you'd like to rent them you MONTH1 ask for assistance, and go from CAPS1. Children of all ages step foot in your library and are bound to come across unneccessary information.  In my own perspective CAPS1 should be an adult section, where only adults above a certain age should be aloud in or be able to check out. By keeping such materials shown or on display, MONTH1 cause children to engage in dangerous or unsafe actions. As for music, it can go both ways. Music is more of a lifestyle, some people can't live without it. Adults in this day and age 'need music to survive' is what they commonly say. If your library decides to take these materials off the shelf, people MONTH1 be turned away and your library MONTH1 lose buisness.What is a library if you don't have music, books, magazines and movies? An empty room. Certain materials that are not appropriate for people of all ages should be placed high up, or in their own area where not everyone is aloud at. Taking away such materials MONTH1 cause alot of grief. Just reorganize and make libraries enviornmentally safe so everyone is welcomed and CAPS1 will be no complications",0
"Computers are a great machine to use. People can research, learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online I think that computers have a good effect on people. Computers are one of the great inventions we have. They are very helpul in our everyday life. When people need to write a paper for school or do a project you can research what you need if you need to know some thing about, a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet. If your writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet. Suppose you want to go on a family vacation to california you can plan your whole trip right on your computer, you can book a flight, get a hotel room and even see what there is to do you can see the whole world right from your computer. If you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer. Also if your to busy to go to collage or want to take another class there are even schools online. The computer is a great way to learn about new things. Finally you can talk to friends online websites like facebook and myspace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends. naother positive way is CAPS1 you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back. If you want your friends you can just message them. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They are helpul in many ways such as people can do research, learn about new things and talk to friends I hope, you see my point at view they are samething everyone should have.",0
"In the memoir PERSON1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives there is a thankful and gracious mood. Talking about his parents immigrating, PERSON1 says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life,"" This quote shows thanks because PERSON1 is glad his parents immigrated to give him a better life. Another example of a gracious mood is in paragraph NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" PERSON1 shows his is gracious for what his parents did and how much they care about him. A final example of thanks is, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood."" PERSON1 is thankful that he got the opportunity to grow up in such a great house and community. As you can see from these examples, the memoir had a very thankful and gracious mood to it.",0
"One nice sunny day I was traped in a doctors office with no air conditioning. this doctors office had NUM1 chairs in the dirty waiting room. I was already cramed in the room with about NUM2 people for NUM3 minutes. I was trying to be patient but the patience was wearing off. Sweat dripped of of my face on to my black PERSON1 short-CAPS1 shirt. I was starting to get hot and mad, but I kept my patience.

"CAPS1 judgment comes from expirience, and expirience comes from bad judgement, qouted from my uncle's dad. Computers haven't been around all that long for the public, so the public has little experience. Therefore, the public also lacks CAPS1 judgement in using computers and the detrimental effects are starting to show. Computers have caused damage to people! To begin with, computers can be a CAPS2 issue for people. In studies in LOCATION1, NUM1 out of NUM2 CAPS3 who spend their time (NUM3 or more hours) are wearing glasses. Because of bad CAPS2 effects the screen has on your eyes. Furthermore, computer games are made to be addicting, which causes CAPS3 to sit in front of the computer instead of excercising. This MONTH1 be one of the biggest causes of obesity in LOCATION2! My little brother used to be addicted to a flying game, and he sat in front of it for hours every day and started to get fat. As soon as he stopped playing it and going outside more he immediatly started to lose fat. Therefore, people need to move around more instead of sitting in front of the computer. To continue, my second argument is about detrimental effects computers have on the enviroment. First, computers need electricity to run. That electricity comes from power plants. Over PERCENT1 of LOCATION2's powerplants are coal, petroleum, or natural gas based. When people turn on the computer because they are bored, it wastes electricity that doesn't need to be used. Furthermore, scientists suspect humans are now a major cause of global warming. It is common sense that those powerplants burn their respective fuels to create electricity. In other words there is a definite connection between computers and global warming. Also, the powerplants release pollutants into the air that can eventually cause acid rain. To end with, my last argument is about people's skills. In a school survey, CAPS3 who used their computers for more than NUM4 hours per day didn't know how to cook or how to even light a match! There is a definite connection between the two as most people just put something in the microwave to eat to be able to go back to the computers as fast as possible. The matches are lit by parents to light fires or candles, But what happens when a natural disaster strikes like in LOCATION3 or LOCATION4? How will CAPS3 be able to fend for themselves? The only way to cook would be with fire. There wouldn't be microwaves to cook canned food with. Furthermore, how would CAPS3 be able to even start a fire without CAPS4 how to light a match? Evidently excessive computer use could have very detrimental effects in a natural disaster, even to adults, so we need to stop it! Do you want LOCATION2 to be thought of as CAPS5 and CAPS6? Should the enviroment, our only home, suffer because of a few bored people? How will we handle a major natural disaster? In conclusion, people are spending too much time on their computers, and they need to stop! People are becoming CAPS6, CAPS7 the environment, and losing important life skills. We need to all come together and cooperate to keep people healthy, to retain our life skills, but most importantly ssave our one and only beautiful LOCATION5.",0

"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there are lack of a suitable landing area.

For example they said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". The next obstacle is dirigibles from outside of the United States. The dirigibles German's use hydrogen which is flammable.

"CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friendsfamily. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine! Internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain, and attack you to all the websites and neat little things. It is more effective just to go to a local ORGANIZATION2 or ORGANIZATION1 to work out. I swim on a swim team for a ORGANIZATION2. I love swimming better than going on the computer. It satisfies my personal needs of exercising. I lost NUM1 pounds by just swimming for a month. I will run on the tred mill to help me burn of stress or anger. Gyms are way better than computers. I know most of us have seen something inapropprate on the computer. Yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings. I know the other day I saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. I know youtube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so hurray for them. Once you give something to the internet it is lost forever. Yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to CAPS3 or visit in person. Like my CAPS2 always said,"" CAPS3 more, it builds character!"" CAPS4 ever I get the chance I CAPS3 my best buddies instead of using the computer. Kids theses days can be mean with out try. You disconnect yourself from your family. Because computers attrack users, there are times where you don't pay attention to others around you. PERCENT1 of kids donot do there home work because of computers. Thank you for your time. I think computers are bad and everyone would be happy with out them. They help the obesity level in the nation, let cyber bullying and inappronrate content flow around the internet and lastly block you out from the world.

"I would wont computors because it benifits our society. It helps on learn about countries around the world and whats going on. For example if you wanted to no about it's sports, you can just type in name. Also a computer can help you with your education. If you were working on a homework assingment and you needed some help you can just go on the computor. It is also very benifial because student can have lots of fun playing games on the comput say like it's a cold rainy day and there is nothing to do, a kid can get some entertainment by going on the computer. It is also a good way to communicate with you friends. For example, facebook, CAPS3, twitter, and email one all good sources of communication. Also it is good for if you have a xbox or a NUM1 you need a computer you need to hook up a card to your computer so you can play online with your friend. It's good to have computors in school. Is teachers want some students to go on a website to learn something it is a very helpful source. It is also a good in source because in school if your working on this big project a computer can help you do it. I hope these one all good reason to have computer in our society, and it will benifit us in a number a differnt ways",0
"CAPS1 I can see both sides of your argument, on wether computers are important. However, computers have revelotivizied they way we live our lives. Just for a moment, think what would the world be like without computers. I feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives. Computers are espicially important to students and teachers. For instance if a student needed to do a report on LOCATION1, he could look up facts and other things on LOCATION1, then he could condence the facts into a paragraph on a word document, and if he had a question he could email his teachers. Finaly he, could print out the finished report. All that, without having to get up and bother his parrents to go to the bookstore and pay NUM1 on a book that he will probably read one time. Also if he had a question there would be no comunication outside of school. Anothe example of students using computers is online textbooks, which spares them of logging heavy texbooks home. Because I know computers have helped me in school and more work much easier. Secondly, PERCENT1 of busnesses say that they use computer daily, and some agree that without computer, their busnesses would fail. Computer make busnes much easier, espically with the busness monoging and file keeping programs that are oidible. On a computer, busnesses can store customer information, comppare income, and keep stock of inventary without having a cluttered pile or file cobinet. Computers can also saave buseness money because that con cut out jobs such as record keeper.

"Honestly there's alot of books and magagives that need to be taking off the self. I can remember in the sixth grade going to the schools library and picking up a book that not only told me wha weed was it told me how to grow it! Also alot of book refer to drug and sex now a days and  absolutly hate it! The last book I checked out, even though it is been a while sence ive checked one out, had enough referances to sex that i could honestly say I thought I was read a porn magazine.     Our schools really need to watch what they put onto there selfs. I mean come on sixth graders shouldnt even be able know what weed is! Let alone read about it in school! maybe that why kids get interested in drugs and achole at such an early age. The book I read didnt have any negative satments about the weed. what makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs?     Like I said before alot of book in schools and pubic librarys have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex. They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are, what kind of high it'll give you. And were you can buy the crap to make them!     Ok I know im in highschool but you should have book that seem like pron magazines. The book i read have pictures of postions in it! it broke everything down into details! It even gave websites on the back of the book. And that my friends is not alright. Its just sad.     It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading. Doesn't it scare you? I know I dont want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail. Let alont them reading about it at all. just take the books off the schools and pubic librarys selfs. Hardly anyone will read them anyway. And if they do its by accident like mine incounters where",0

"I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They even allow people to talk online. Computers are a very usefull piece of machinery. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. When your in school, you need to type lots of CAPS1 prompts, CAPS2 labs, and CAPS3 CAPS4 vocab. Computers help us do that. Typing fast and correctly takes practice. Typing without looking at the keyboard is hand-eye coordination. This will help us later on in life also. Whether it's typing term papers in high school or your application essay for college, you will need the help of computers. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. NUM1 years ago I look a trip to LOCATION3 for the first time. I didn't know a lot about the history of LOCATION3 so I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. Suddenly, it was like I was in LOCATION3! I read about the delicious food and rich culture. I took a virtual tour of the CAPS5 CAPS6 and the great CAPS7. I heard CAPS8 music and learned some CAPS8. In just NUM2 hour I visited LOCATION3 right from my very own house! Computers can take you on a magical journey to a far away country. Computers allow people to talk to online with other people. This is a very good thing. I have cousins who live in LOCATION2 and because of the NUM3 hour time difference, its not always easy to talk on the phone so we use the computer. My family will send e-mails back and forth with them. Sometimes we will even video chat! CAPS3 networking sights accesible by computer such as CAPS10 or CAPS11 allow us to talk to people who we don't regularly see. On CAPS11 you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians. Computers let us keep in touch with others. Computers have a positive effect on people. Some experts MONTH1 say that people spend too much time on the computer and while that MONTH1 be true to some people, its not true to everyone. We still exersise, and spend time outside.

Being a conservitive myself,I do not believe that these books should not be in book stores,libaries, or other public venues.

The setting in  Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was tacking through the high desert of California in June. June is a hot part of the year and since he was in the hottest desert part the hot was multiplied. The terrain changing into short rolling hills didnt help the cyclist. The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement. With the person lack of water anyone would be struggling to keep riding on. Most people didnt have that hints to keep moving. He didnt set a very goal he just went to the next Horizon. Shouldnt he just wanted to keep going. Another problem with the physical environment was the road conditions. When the Rough Road Affect sign appeared the travel then become more difficult. A bike tire take more effort to go over uneven pavement is why the cyclist had so much trouble.,0
"Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people.  ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION1 was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. CAPS4 did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the CAPS1 CAPS2. Very creative, I know. This CAPS2 was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives.  One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the CAPS2. We watched as the boys ran as fast as CAPS4 could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the ORGANIZATION1 would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the ORGANIZATION1 studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the CAPS2, a few boys walked up to us.  ""CAPS3 to play some football with us? We could use more people!"" CAPS4 said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the ORGANIZATION2 rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the CAPS1 CAPS2. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The CAPS2 was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun.  But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter.",0
"There were a handful of problems that came along with the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.  This idea was hardly practical, for safety reasons mostly.  If a dirigible docked there on one cable, extreme tension would be put on the building.  Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catostrophic.The task of actually docking would be a problem as well.  With such a high altitude, winds were very strong.  Nothing could prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building.  In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights.  However, if these were to fall, they would land in the busy city streets of New York.  Lastly, there was a law against low flying air ships, completely dismissing the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.",0
The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story.,0
"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Originally, the greatest problem builders faced was strengthening the building's foundational base in order to support the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure. To combat this, MONEY1 of modifications had to made to the building's framework. Unfortunately, most of the complications of the mooring mast were not considered until after it was built. A most important one was safety, in that that many foreign dirigibles to use helium to float which is highly flammable. A disaster like the Hindenburg disaster over New York City is too dangerous to risk. Another preventer of the mast were the winds at the top of the building that were constantly changing due to the violent air currents. The swaying dirigible could not be secured with hanging weights due to the danger of dropping one over a very populated New York City. A huge complication of making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a docking to ever take place. The many obstacles that face the builders of the Empire State building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, eventually led to the dropping of the idea all together.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to construct this marvelous building One obstacle was making sure the stress of the building from the dirigible would go to the foundation of the building and not the top or middle where it could cause it to collapse. As said in the text ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" CAPS1 the building had to be changed in many ways to make it stable enough for dirigible to dock.Another obstacle was the weather above the building which was very strong winds and air currents. This would mean that the dirigible would just be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" and that's not a safe thing to have highly flammable hydrogen floating around above millions. An obstacle as well that came with these dirigibles was all the time and effort they had to put in to learn how to safely install a mooring mast. This took people going to professionals like the Navy and finding out the proper way. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building caused many obstacles to get in the way.",0

As I was about to finish I had realized I was late for school I was only I NUM1 grade so I ran got dressed and told my sisters to CAPS5 and get ready but you no how girls can be putting CAPS4 there make-CAPS6 and doing there hair.      My sister PERSON2 was in NUM2 grade and my other sister was in NUM3 grade our schools were right next to each other so they finally got ready and we were CAPS4 our way heading off to school ready for an awesome day with my teacher PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world but I only liked her was because when we were cleaning our desk she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend PERSON1 would have so much fun playing in the cream. We began the day with a book and the book was by ""CAPS1 foul"" I can't recall the name but I remember the cover was gold an was about ghouls and monsters the way she read it was like if we were there that book was so intense even tho i really didn't understand it. Next she would give us a math worksheet I know right math in NUM1 grade but I was really smart at math and she would always pick CAPS4 me and give me harder math then others and when I asked her why I was getting harder math then the other kids she had told me I was different. I new I was smarter then some kids but not all so I never knew if that was a complement or an insult but I really didn't care. So now that we got that out of the way we can get to the fun part were all the laughter is so school is over right and I'm trying to find my sister to walk me home, after NUM5 min looking for i find her walking to the cross walk I yell her name ""CAPS2"". She looks and I'm running to her and her friends as you no she didn't want to be seen with an annoying little brother so she ran across the street.   My dad was waiting in the car and my sister got to the car before me and I was in a CAPS5 to get to the car and I had to wait for the cross guard lady to CAPS3 to me. At last she finally had noticed me, I was CAPS4 walking in an hurried past to get to the car because I had herd my dad yelling ""CAPS3 CAPS4 CAPS5 CAPS6""so I was walking faster and faster and as I was walking I herd from a distance a car speeding down the street, but what I hadn't noticed it was it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner nearly hit the cross guard lady, the car had hit the crossing stick the out of no were I was hit flying and rolling down the street. I was hit and bruised cuts every were my dad was panicking ran out of the car screaming at the lady who had hit me and getting her information license plate number.    As I was laying CAPS4 the ground my dad came to me and was trying to get me CAPS6 he pulled down my pants to see the damage and remember I had my scooby-doo underwear CAPS4 and every one was staring at me I was more embarrassed then hurt I didn't feel the pain until the next day so I was all good I couldn't walk so my dad ran put me in the car and every one was laughing at me because they saw my underwear CAPS4 and my dad rushed me to the house and then called the ambulance. they told my dad that I would be able to walk again but would have trouble doing sports because i have a fractured hip. i was living the dream my sisters were spoiling me giving me candy and my dad giving me ice cream and CAPS4 top of that I couldn't feel the pain. Bu t the fireman said I should be able to go to school the next day and I did and my mean old teacher saw me and i was limping and what she told me got me mad she had told me to ""stop faking it"".

"A long wait   CAPS1 only four at the time. I had moved to LOCATION4. Yes, moved to LOCATION2, LOCATION4 from LOCATION1, CAPS2. Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didnt care too, too much. So I lived in LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to LOCATION3. Well, now I wasnt four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didnt hate the idea but I didnt love it either. Of course. It didnt exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didnt want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. Ive slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year.

"There are some effects computers have on people that I agree with and disagree with. There are many people in the world that use computers every day and some that use it sometimes. Also it always gives you information everytime you use it. I would think that computers give a positive effect on people. Computers can have their likes and dislikes. Not everytime when you need information the computer won't give it to you. There are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things. That is one thing I do not like about computers. Do not think that is too bad because computers have alot more fun adavantages. One of the most common and used thing around the world is instant CAPS7. Instant CAPS7 is when you are communicating with another human bean over the online web. Many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend. There are some names for instant CAPS7 CAPS1 CAPS2, CAPS3, CAPS4-mail, and many more! Yes, the computer can be very addicting but once in a while you need to get off and maybe get some fresh air. For some people I agree that they stay on the computer to much and became very lazy. This is one disadvantage that can cause you from exercizing and seeing friends and family. There is no problem if you go on for an hour a day maybe more, but to long is not good. There are so many things for the computer I can't name them all CAPS5, CAPS6, ORGANIZATION1, CAPS7, and even buying things off the computers, those are many of the things you can do on your computer.

I am one of those people that believes that this quote has a ton of truth and meaning. The best true story that I could tell you that involves me and laughter is about my dad and I.   When I was little and still living with my dad, my mom fought with my dad all the time and neither one of them where ever happy. My dad and mom both had good jobs but they never had money to do anything because my mom loved spending money and got them both into dept. My dad had to sell stuff of his all the time to help pay off all the dept. My parents got divorced wich was a good thing for us all. I got to hang out with my dad and I found out how much fun he is and how funny he can be. My dad and I started going hunting and all sorts of stuff like that. I found that my mom is even worse when she is happy because she gets vary hyper and loud, or you could just say annoying. She gets me to laugh every once and a while but its always at her rather than with her.  I love being with my dad because I always have fun and learn something that will be vary helpful to me.

"The main problem in the original design of the mooring mast was that ""the architects could'nt just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load & the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" Another obstacle the builders faced with the construction of the mast could be another example of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"". With some dirigibles using the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium another ""Hindenburg accident"" could prove to be fatal in a ""highly populated area such as downtown New York."" CAPS1 perhaps the greatest obstacle would be ""nature itself."" The high force winds on top of the empire state building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Although the dirigibles could be weighted down, the weights would be hanging over pedestrians, which ""was neither practical nor safe.""",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". The dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people. Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers.",0
"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, describes complicated obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was competition. ""It was planned as the world's tallest building taller even than the new Chrysler Building,"" (CAPS1 1). ""Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building"" (CAPS1 NUM1). There was a competition as to had the tallest building between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Another obstacle, was the safety and dirigibles. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurts, New Jersey, The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populate area such as down town New York.""

The mood created in this memoir is a warm feeling that surrounds the meaning of family and home.narciso says in the memoir in CAPS1 NUM1 ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the Aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to lif in our warm home.""

"The author, Narciso Rodriguez created a pleasant mood, with a family atmosphere in his memoir. First, he described his childhood home. With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they. Because of this writing style; because of his vivid imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart.",0

"CAPS1, I have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers. This is something that needs to stop because it imports peoples health, safety and education. To open my statements, overuse ORGANIZATION2 the computer con lead to poor health. Take my friend PERSON1 for example. He sits at home on his computer all DATE1 and plays games, goes on CAPS2 and CAPS3. He rarely gets any excersize and he almost never sees daylight. PERSON1 LOCATION1 gained NUM1 pounds, which lead to obeisity and heart problems. He even wears wooden teeth because his general hygene declined as well. Another common health problem that developes from excessive use ORGANIZATION2 the computer is arthrietis. Dr. PERSON3 ORGANIZATION2 the ORGANIZATION1 told ORGANIZATION3, ""The massive amounts ORGANIZATION2 typing on the keyboard can lead to joint problems, arthrietis, and other joint related problems.""

ear local newspaper I raed ur argument on the computers and I think they are a positive effect on people. The first reson I think they are a good effect is because you can do so much with them like if you live in mane and ur cuzin lives in califan you and him could have a wed chat. The second thing you could do is look up news any were in the world you could be stuck on a plane and it would be vary boring when you can take but ur computer and go on ur computer at work and start doing work. When you said it takes away from exirsis well some people use the computer for that too to chart how fast they run or how meny miles they want and sometimes what they eat. The thrid reson is some peolpe jobs are on the computers or making computers for exmple when you made this artical you didnt use a type writer you used a computer and printed it out if we didnt have computers it would make ur CAPS1 a lot harder. Thank you for reading and whe you are thinking adout it agen pleas consiter my thrie resons.,0

"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, a great mood is created by the author. This mood is unity. One reason why the mood is unity is because even while Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved from Cuba to the United States they stayed together. After they had first moved to the LOCATION3 they had a child and that really shows how much unity came into play. Another reason why the mood of this memoir is unity is because, when the Rodriguez's were first living in the United States, the other immigrants in their neighborhood became family. And paragraph three it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" A synonym for solidarity is unity, so here the author is even saying how his neighborhood all united into one big happy neighborhood. The final reason why the mood of this memoir is unity is because even after all of these years, Rodriguez ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" To this day, his family is still united and they all still love each other. In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is unity throughout Rodriguez's and his family's whole story.",0
"Censorship is found on television, in libraries, in schools, and even in homes. Do you think that censorship should be used? Censorship can be used to block one's personal thoughts and opinions to promote conformism. I disagree with the idea of Censorship. Not everyone thinks people should be able to have their own images and visions; however, that is what makes our world so individualized.     Censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually. The government does not want the society, especially the youth, of LOCATION1 to read things that are deemed inappropriate. Should that not be up to one's guardian, or if they are old enough, to oneself? When you read books, you see language being block out, they take parts out to make the book seem more classy, also they block out things such as drugs and alcohol. A lot of people believe that books are what hurt a lot of today's society. I believe that reading material could be a lot more educational if the editors woud leave some of the things that they censor, in the book. I believe this because, if parents decide to not let their child read a story that is up to them; however, their child could learn about certain situations and possibly learn how to handle those difficult things.     This opinion that censorship in books could be absolutely debatable. Censorship such as in the book, ORGANIZATION1 is being used. The government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive. This is understandable also. I do not believe this amazing novel should be seen in this way. The language was not meaning to be used offensively, but simply to state how people talked and how things were when PERSON1 was alive. If it were not for books like this, how would out society learn about not only LOCATION1's history, but other culture's history? In all fairness, ORGANIZATION1 is an educational novel about how times were in the day of ORGANIZATION1 and CAPS1.     Censorship in movies is also growing. Television will block out things such as language, nudity, alcohol, drugs, and things of that nature. I would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere, but it could educate people on what and what not to do. I believe if censorship were not used, people's thoughts would be more apt to imagine. Imagination can scare people. Some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal; but what is normal? It is to the community, doing what everyone else is doing and not being different, this scares people.     This whole essay brings me back to the thought that censorship is basically conformism. The word conformism means to all become one; to conform. If this is the case no one will ever come up with new books, music, movies, magazines, or ideas; we will all just be citizens of LOCATION1 or any other culture trapped inside our very own minds",0

"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is grateful and happy. First, CAPS1 is very grateful because CAPS1 says ""...To give their children a better life"" His parents gave up what they were doing in their homeland Cuba to come live in LOCATION1 to make a better life for their child to start off and live in. CAPS1 recognizes this but, CAPS1 also knows CAPS1 can never do enough to thank them. Next, it says ""family has nothing to do with love relatives."" CAPS1 is very grateful and thankful that CAPS1 grew up in the neighborhood CAPS1 did where everyone was treated like brothers and sisters and they all felt saf in their community that they created. Also the story says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" CAPS1 knows that it took a lot of heart to do that much for someone else when all it did for his parents was make their lif tougher. They had to start over and that is what made him most grateful for his parents. That is what I truly think the mood of the story is.",0
"Since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south. The plants are losing there leaves. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence.

And when it comes back next year it will rejuvinate her.",0
I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was leading to it and the story  would have been pointless if it wasnt conclusion.,0
"The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a time period you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when weather change this can be different for Saeng. Maybe she is relating herself to the plant as to when it come to spring  the flower will be stronger, and she feel that she will pass the test second time around when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. And it also shows how she appriate the nature because if not, why would she wait until spring and when the snow is melting. The conclusion of the story is that she do like nature, because she talk about the hibiscus.",0
The mood  displayed by the author was a warm cozy feeling that felt like home. It showed his small house and family and their interests and how they all acted together. It really showed what he called home and what he called a family. The memoir explained the food he ate and the music he heared all through out his childhood and how he grew up.,0
My mood while reading this memoir written by the author was a little bittersweet. It talked about sweet little things that were sad but sometimes happy. They talked about sacrifice so much in this memoir. And it feels like they all have to grow up faster because it is so different than our lives ane they are more gratefull then us even though they have like not as much. And it sounds like everyone gets along so easily and yet they make do with all they have. It really touched my heart.,0
"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a heart-warming, and comforting mood for the readers. First, we see this comforting mood being established through the setting. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" (CAPS1 NUM1). This creatively loving setting gives the reader a sense of comfort when reading the piece. Next, we see this sense of heart-warming coming from Rodriguez's word choice. ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" (CAPS1 NUM2). This rich, vivid word choice sets a caring mood through out the piece. Lastly, the family's background started out somewhat bitter, and depressing when Rodriguez explains their financial instability in CAPS1 NUM3, but then later on, we see the family moving to LOCATION1, and finding comfort in their new home. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (CAPS1 NUM4). This sense of family contributes to the heart- warming mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir.",0
"The mood that the author in the memoir has created is a soft happy and CAPS1 mood. He trys to say how grateful and happy about his memoir. An example is ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their Rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am enternally gratefull)"" OR ""Passionate Cuban Music (Which I adore to this day). His mood is also saying that hes happy for what he has because he said that his parents are very couragous and he could of never did what they did. The authors mood is very grateful.",0
"Throughout the passage, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author displays many moods in his writing. One of the moods of the story is love.

Not their real family but the people in thier neiabor hood that they considered family. And they would always have they would always have people eat over and stay over if the needed to. And the other mood of the story is being grateful. That Narciso Rodriguez was grateful that his parents gave up everything to come to LOCATION1 so he could have a good life. That they gave up all their friends, family, jobs, and the country they loved so he could have a good life. And he was grateful for all the things that they taught him.

"In this selectian family is being defined, and Narciso Rodriguez gives it a whole new definition. Narciso Rodriguez is now a recognized clothing designer, but as a child she also had a great life ful of laughter and love. She grew up in a two family home within Newark, New Jersey. I can now smell, hear, and picture  the inside of where Narciso grew up. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today, and for which I am eternally gratefull."" This sentence gives me an image of that happy family and puts me in a good mood, While it reminds me of my our family and the memories that we share among our kitchen. Passionate Cuban music, which I adore to this day, filled the air mixing with the aromas in the kitchen. This sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime. Narciso Rodriguez definitily created a mood in this selection, and it was a good one.",0
"The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water.

"The author in the memoir created many different moods. One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he adored the music, culture, cooking and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because of racism is a bad concept and also because the family is Cuban. Other moods that the author set were moods of gratetfulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless parents and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love.

Well about PERCENT1 of the world says that computers are a great way to communicate with friends, family, and different people around the world. They also mentioned now its a good hands on-eye coordination on adults and students. A wonderful educational source to use in schools, jobs, etc. First off the reason why I say that its a great way to communicate is because of the programs that computers have memoried into them that are little numbers all around universe to connect with your friends, family, and people around earth. For example like yahoo, facebook, twitter,, myspace, etc these are all types of ways to communicate with people and bring more social which is a healthy way in life. More than half the world have these communication source because one it easier and you get more of your mind. Another reason why they MONTH1 have these connections its probably because its a better way to see one another if you live in different parts of earth. The reason why I said that its another way of seeing people around the world is because right now I'm living in LOCATION1 and in order to see the ones I love and care about is by my myspace and facebook to be able to see my family and friends that lice that live in different locations from me like LOCATION2, LOCATION4, LOCATION3, etc. Another reason is because its a good hands on eye coordination on adults and students.",0

"CAPS1 tired, lazy people sitting on their computer and wasting their life bacause of it. The issue to with is do you think that people are spending to much time on the computer or not. I strongly believe that people are spending to much time on the computer. And, here are CAPS2 reasons why, people are spending less time exercising, people not enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. Without a doubt you probably know that exercising is at least somewhat helpful to life, CAPS4 if people are sitting home NUM1 on the computer with no exercise, it is going to cause people to gain an excess amount of wait. Because the more they just sit around. And do nothing except the computer. The more they're going to be and the more lazy they're going to be. So they're not going to want to do anything and really it's just a waist of life. And, in some cases it can cause depression.

Just ask another local resident PERSON1 who says, ""I remember coming home everyday, and there was CAPS2 mom, no shades up, pitch block, it was like a dark cave, and she would sit there for hours on the computer wasting her life, and I remember asking her how long has it been since you've gone outside, she answered, its been almost two months.""

"cd, dvdvcr tape, magazine, etc.,because of whether or not they are offensive or obscene is a panzy move from the people who think the world must be perfect when in reality it is so far from perfect that it is disgusting,and yet the sad truth is the fact that only a small percentage of people on the face of the earth have come to accept this truth. If I have not conviced you other wise please keep reading.     I believe that if the world can not handle what is on the shelf at the public library they should just leave it alone, and stay in there comfort zone of reading seletions. If they are offended they can go to read some where else.       I understand that people might have been there first. If that is the case well then nicely ask the personpersons offending you to move some where else.     The world is not a perfect place by no means. The world does have it's positives for instance the CAPS1 nations, and north atlantic treaty organization (CAPS2.A.T.O.), but for some reason the world acts as if they are going to die if there is not perfection all around them.

The only thing good about the movie is CAPS2 was a few dramatic and thats it. Another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again. It's like the liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repitions. But some how it got an award and is one of the must for high school student's. I think the story overall was alright beside the fact CAPS2 was offensive in it though. Books like that shouldn't be put on shelves and if they are the need to take the offensive language out but obviously people liked the book or it wouldn't have awards.                                   So obviously 'To CAPS3 A CAPS4' was a good story but when it comes down to it could offend alot of people I hear people talking about the book still and I read it last year. So In CAPS7, I think CAPS2 should be censorship in libraries.",0
"In attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building the builders faced many problems. The first problem was the fact that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The problem with hydrogen is that it is highly flamable and would be a huge risk to have a hydrogen dirigible over a city full of pedestrians because it could catch on fire and hurt them.Secondly, the wins at the height of the Empire State Building were always shifting which presented great risk to pilots. If their dirigible got blown off course it could collide with other tall buildings in the city. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles got blown off course by the strong winds and the pilot could not take his hands off the controls in fear of hitting other buildings.Lastly, there was a pre-existing law that would have made it illegal for a dirigible to have entered the airspace around the Empire State Building.",0
"I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpfull place. Who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develope a lot of problems. Muisc can be straight offensive.      If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is raciest, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an affect on you. You MONTH1 not realise that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a differant race. If a person isn't raciest and they see something that is, it could offend them. They MONTH1 feel like they 'cool'. They go out and say raciest things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technicly bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries.      Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie.They MONTH1 not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They MONTH1 go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These moives can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it.      In magizines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magizines. If you see PERSON1 in a magizine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. Its normal for someone to be jeleous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We MONTH1 starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. Into today's society, people stive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stair. We use the girls in the magizine to helps us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magizines can be offensive.      In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head everytime you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realise that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just beeing a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, 'CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self harm. Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society. Their is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut theirselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries.      We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is ment to be a good place. Anyone can go their. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of.",0
"In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it. When he finally got to Gary & Wilbers fish camp, he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map.''",0
"In the book 'CAPS1 NUM1', books are outlawed. In such a society, owning a book would result in recieving a punishment. Without books, CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government. CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, CAPS2 important works would be thrown away.     A recent debate has arisen over PERSON1's 'The CAPS3 of ORGANIZATION1.' CAPS4 book is set in the LOCATION3 during the time of slavery. ORGANIZATION1 PERSON4 befriends a black man, PERSON6, and shares CAPS2 experiences with him along the LOCATION1. PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the LOCATION3 during CAPS4 time period. He was the first author to do CAPS4. Because he wrote it in CAPS4 way, the book contains the n-word multiple times. CAPS4 word is not acceptable today, and therefore CAPS2 people take offense to his work. However, CAPS4 book plays a major role in the CAPS5 cannon. PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of CAPS5 literature.     'ORGANIZATION2' by PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at LOCATION2, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with CAPS2 of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, CAPS4 is not the case. PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In 'PERSON2', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. CAPS4 story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with.     Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works MONTH1 have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning.",0

My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the x-box. Alls I did was sit in a chair and watch him. He finally got the x-box fixed after about seven or eight hours. Once me and my friend began to play the game it broke again. So then we had to take the game to CAPS1 CAPS2 and have them look at it. I had to have patients because if I didnt I would have been really bored. Once CAPS1 CAPS4 looked at the system they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting dirigibles to dock there. First the stress of ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" was a problem. So the steel frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the dirigibles. Next, they faced the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" CAPS1, the greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building that changed due to violent air currents. If you had a dirigible moored and weighted down with lead weights above pedestrians, it could lead to disaster. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders realized too many obstacles interfered and it could never happen.",0
"'CAPS1, CAPS1, CAPS1 I like CAPS4 CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men. While 'CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now look closly at both lymrics you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song CAPS4 CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere.     To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay. Well its not; banning books, music, etc. is just like cencoring someones imaginationa and creativity. It is just like the book DATE1, where CAPS4 CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read, and even think. Taking away movies and books, is to not allow people to learn from their past.     Take CAPS9 CAPS10 CAPS11 for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during CAPS12 CAPS13 NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go. Always remeber the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been cencored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hardtimes of the CAPS13 and what it can do to a persons soul and emotions.     A book, magazine, movie, etc are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was NUM2 at the time, and i rushed through my ipod to find a song 'CAPS14 to CAPS15 a CAPS16' by the CAPS17. I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of sucicide away.     While yes, there aresongs & books like The CAPS18 and the CAPS19 that MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We stilll see more good being done and shown through reading and writing. Because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can CAPS15 a CAPS16 as much as it can take one away. Even then we can that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get cencored. If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved becasue it is an unreachable thing",0
"CAPS2 people use computers more? No they CAPS2 not use computers more. Computers have many benefits to society but it also have many negitive effects on people who use them. People are spending more time on computers and less than exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First, people spend less time exercising. Most athletes have to stay fit and healthy to play in there sport. I am a wrestler and a baseball player but if I don't spend some time a day working out or staying active. I will be out of shape and weaker once my match or next game come along. I'm sure olympic athletes work out and stay active daily so they can be stronger and faster than anybody else out there so I don't know why people sit at home on the computer all day. Second, people don't take the time to enjoy nature. Nature is one of the most beautiful things on this planet. Wether you hiking a mountain of a lake, nature is all around you. I personaly love to hunt and fish. I take the time every sumer, DATE1, fall,and sometimes winter to go out, enjoy nature, and have fun, and so do many other people in the world. Everyone who sits at home on the computer can't enjoy this gift that we have been given. Third, people won't take the time to with family or friends. If you the computer all day ther you can't go out and be active with your friends, or go for a bike ride with you brother. If you are on the computer you on family friend time that could be being used as a fishing trip or a walk in the woods. If you don't spend time with your family because of something you're doing on the computer, then you just a person. You won't valueable thing that you have in life you r family and you CAPS2 always be able to make time them. Finally, CAPS2 people use computers more? No, they CAPS2 not use computers more.

So she saying she will take the test next year.,0
The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced was harsh. They had to figure out how they were going to get the dirigibles to land on the mooring mast. A another problem was that the government was getting unpaticent. What made thing worse was Al smith was being sneaky and unturful. He lied about how high the actulty hieght is. He lied about how he will fix the problems the was with the mooring mast. They were also afraid that a dirigible will blowup on the mooring mast like the CAPS1. So they just put it aside and made over time the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the use by the sightseers.,0

Almost all the features of the settin affect the cyclist. For instence the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. The water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt. These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweety and hes been drinking so much.

"The Empire State building is known as the worlds tallest building. The building is located in New York. Al Smith the head of building the Empire State building, added a top or a hat to the building, that made the building be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. The Empire State building was equipped for transportation. The transportation was dirigible, or zeppelin. The Empire State building had a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. An obstacle that the Building faced was New York's lack of a suitable landing area. Al seen an opportunity to get people to and from the Empire state building. Al seen it as something creative and new. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never fulfilled. No thought of safety was thought about before constructing the idea either.

"Coming from a teenager, CAPS1 offensive books, magazines and movies should be removed from a local library. A library is a place to go relax and read. Most books and movies are filled with sex,gang violence, and drugs. In my generation sex, durgs and, gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere. Books are suppose to be about learning. Offensive books and movies set bad habit on younger children.These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries.         Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence. Children should never be exposed to that type of  offensive behavor. You should be able to open a magazine and   learn somthing brand new.    Books are good for reseach paper and other school project, but sometimes you cant find what you are looking for because of other topics. Reason you cant find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covred with  the topic you dont want. As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence.     If younger children, countiued to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit on that child. They say you are involved  with what you read. Bad habit could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking , and pregnacy's. Thats why all parents should have guidence over there children.     Being who I am , there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazine in a local library. Offensive books and movies can cause many problems. It drive children where they sont need to be, and you wont be able to learn if you have to many bad habit. there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library.",0
"The effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one, and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced, not feared and avoided. Whether we like it or not, computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future. Besides, for personal usage, computers are highly beneficial. The main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers is radiates, which really isn't reasonable, when analyzed closely. To not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational, the computer is the future plain and simple. It is inevitable that the computer and technology related to that, paint the picture of the future of our world. Whether people like the concept or not, computers will be necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time. Computers can predict natural disasters, and with that, people in the area of the catastrophe's destination can be evacuated. Lives can be saved. Computers can calculate, pollutional margins, and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and CAPS1. ORGANIZATION1 Nature can be spared. So much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use. People must adapt to LOCATION1 technology, or we will fall behind and watch our CAPS1 slip away. This proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive, but necessary to advance in an ever-growing world. Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans. Computers in most cases, do better work and create less error than humans themselves. Instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water, computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas. Also, faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumtances, such as an occurance in a workplace causing the area to be off-limits. As member of the workplace can simply e-mail his employer, informing them of the accuracy and preventing them from putting themselves in danger, or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work. Even from LOCATION1 to LOCATION2, with simply the press of ""CAPS2"", people across the world can be of the accident. Foreign communication, specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations, in the fields of both business and government. Lastly, finding information, is so easy with a CAPS3. Where would be without computers to find information rapidly? We would be still going to the library and checking out books, reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less even a minute on a computer. Even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial. As you can see, on even a less global level of use, the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users. The one thing, parents especially, that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability. When these two topics are analyzed, it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer. Installing a program of which there are infinite to choose from, that allows ""good"" websites to be viewed, and ""bad"" on potentially dangerous CAPS4 to be binded. This eliminates all that is heard about on-line interactions and activity gone bad. Even without software to block dangerous websites, computers are generally safe. Only NUM1 out of NUM2 websites, includes content considered ""detrimental"" to humans. Also, of those NUM2, NUM4 provide reliable, correct information. Those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder. That goes to show that the computer's negative aspects can be eliminate, leaving only the positives to remain. In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives. Computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. Why wouldn't somebody want to save the life of another? Also, the benefits of CAPS3, or personal computers, are too large and helpful to pass up. Lastly, when viewed carefully, computers are very reliable, and can be made extremely safe, which eliminates the main fear computers. We have come so far to create such a safe, beneficial, and necessary device, we must put it to use, and by doing so, better our own lives, and the life of ORGANIZATION1.",0

"I believe that some materail should be remove if very offensive. I also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf. Everyone, has different thoughts about was is offensive or apropreate and whats not.  Also, everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books,music,movies,magazines, and so on are apropreate. Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be apropreate for them.And the liabary should put warning stickers on  the book, so that person knows the graphic or voulgur language. Therefore, I beleive that the laibaries should put warning signs on anything to reduce less books being removed from the shelfs.   And so forth my decision is to not remove certain materail, only if offensive. The liabaries should use warning stickers on books so that person knows ahead of time about the graphic or voulgur language. I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our liabaries. Even thought alot of people will dis agree, this is what I believe should happen.  Heres why I believe this should happen. One day when I was younger just starting to read I came across a book. I was reading it to my mother then she takes the book away and gives it to the liabarean and told what happen. I guess I said a very inapropeate word and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it. So, now everytime my mother takes my younger brothers to the liabary she makes sure the book they want are apropeate for there age group so the same incadent wont happen again.wouldnt you be the same way with your children? I know I would not just for my kids but for other children also",0
"My opinion about the effects of computers is that computers do help you but people should not us the computer to lot because people should exercise, interacting with family and enjoy nature. Exercising is more important than a computers because it will make you health, you will not be sick so much. Interacting with family is more important than a computers because the MONTH1 help you have friend but not a family's help you when you help and maybe that friend in the computer is maybe not real that is why it is important to interacting with family. And the last thing that is more important than a computers is enjoying nature. It is fun because you are not bored. You be outside, you will not think about the computer because you will be enjoying so much. My opinion is that computers should only be us to see your mail or to learn something you want to find out in the computer.",0

Very hot, the water was also NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, about forty miles into the petal, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot.",0
"Censorship in liraries, in my opinion is over-rated. Everywhere you hear of book, music, magazines, and movies being offensive or degrading, but does that mean that they should be taken off the shelves of our public libraries, or out of book stores? I say no because, future generations need to know of the material, it MONTH1 not always be offensive, and the public libraries have no right to tell us what we can, and cannot read.     Some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge, or become naive because of this lack of knowledge. I say this is because of the censorship in libraries. Katherine paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chilren have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. An then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So if they're taking books off the shelve because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broder view as so many people are lucky to have today.     Everyone has a different oppinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not. If one person see's a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also. I've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of The CAPS1, because the think it's offensive. Not everyone agrees with that. The CAPS1 is a big part in history and it being catorgorized as offensive is wrong, it's not the only thing in history that is bad. If they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten.     Lastly i believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read. We have the right to choose what we want to read, if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it. But that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offesive. Someone else might want to read it. I think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children their parents are the one's that could pick for them.     With so many different oppinions it's hard to decide what to do about censorship, I believe that if it's offensive maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading. Maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. Some of these obstacles had easy solutions, but some of them were really hard to solve.One obstacle they had was the dirigible on top of the building being hold by a cable tether only would cause stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem they needed to make modifications that would cost around six thousand dollars. This wasn't the only problem, there was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to get close to this area or even try to get tie up to the building. Adding to this, the most difficult obstacle the architects faced was nature, and this problem was hard to solve and also hard to control.All this obstacles they faced lead them to give up for now & wait to see if later with more technology the could finally make this dream come true.",0

"The mood created by the author in the memoir is like a mellowish mood. Almost like a fun loving feeling. The author had literally put himself into the memoir as I read. Paragraph two, had used parentheses several times within the text. The parentheses had given the author's look into his reality. Which had helped to create a calm mellow feel. Over all the mood was fairley simple, fun. In the last sentence it stated that the author had said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" It had basically described that the family did not have much, but made the best of what they did have. The last sentence had made the whole memoir have a calm mellowish feel. In conclusion, the author in the memoir had created a mellow feeling throughout the whole memoir.",0
The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.,0

His parents gave him these qualities which he adores but he is ""eternally grateful for his rich culinary skills that were passed on to him by his parents. PERSON1 also talked about the role of ""family"" in the environment in which he grew up in. In his neighborhood, many people were the victims of racism, so they all came together to be a stronger whole. By growing up like this he learned how to give a helping hand to those who were in need. PERSON1 also told the reader of the courage his parents had by leaving everything they knew and loved behind and how he wished he could have that same courage, but at least he knew of it.",0
"I think that they shounldn't remove the censorship books in the libraries because so bigger kids can read the books not the little kids because they don't need to here the kind of words in the books.  Also the little  kids has to small of ear to hear and also to small of eyes to even see the words in the book like that.  The bigger kids like in grades NUM1  should be able to look at the books because it will be word that have heard before.          The books shouldn't be in the lower grade libraries becaues the little kids will ckeack the books out of the libraries, like the books thatis called CAPS1 A CAPS2 CAPS3 because it says the n word a lot of times, a other one is CAPS4 and CAPS5 becaues says a lot of dirt words like the f, s, and ect.words that they don't need to hear that young of age.       Another reason why it wounld not be fair to the bigger kids if they take away from the libraries becaues they tring to get the out of the libraries so the littler kids don't get the books to take home read at home.  If you are going to take away the books tale them away from the grades NUM2 becaues the that the book called CAPS1 A CAPS2 CAPS3, and CAPS4 And CAPS5 will be bad for those kids to read.     Some more reasons why bigger kids should read the books and why not the little kids shouldn't read the books.  Why should the bigger kids in grade NUM1 should read them becaues they are bigger then the littler kids are. The littler kids shouldn't becaues we don't want the littler kids to go home and say the words to there mom, dad, grandme, grandpa, and ect.

"The builders of the empire state building where faced with multiple problems for their idea in for what the building would be used for.The first problem for the builders came up about the buildings frame. A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building held by only one cable would cause to much stress to the buildings frame. the load of the dirigible and the wind would have to go to the buildings foundation, which was much to far below. The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. The architects made changes to the building to fit these needs. But again the architects we're presented with a problem. The mast of the building would cause problems that should have been spotted by the architects way befor construction. the biggest problem having to do with safety issues. most dirigible outside the country used hydrogen wich is highly flammable. There already had been an exsplosion one over New York could be to much.",0

"Laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things. Like, if your having a bad day, a friend can try and make you laugh to help you feel better. Or maybe something like you lost a loved one. Yes it's a very tragic thing, especially if you really close to that family member. People will still try and make you laugh and tell you that there in a better place and won't be in pain anymore. I have had some moments like this and I sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh. I also know that I have people that care for me and want me to be happy and full of laughter. The most recent time I have needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. It was yesterday night, I had math homework that I needed too do. It frustrated me so much, I started too cry. i told my boyfriend this and he just started telling all of these silly jokes. They kind of helped. What helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this DATE1. I started smiling and laughing because I was so happy that he could. Another time that I have had laughter help me was when I was at CAPS1 with my mom, dad, brother, and little sister about NUM1 years ago. My brother decided that he want too take me on CAPS2 CAPS3. I can't remember if that was the ride though. Anyway, he took me in it about NUM2 or NUM3 time. I was so scared, and wet that I didn't talk too him for the rest of the day. He finally apologized and took me too a face painter lady in one of the stores. I chose what I wanted on my face, I can't quite remember what it was though, I think it was some kind of fish. But, after she had finished, I looked in the mirror she had and I burst out laughing. I laughed for about ten minutes and said that I accepted his apology. When we arrived home a few days later, I took the hose and sprayed him with it just too get him back. And too be a little stinker of a sister, like all little sisters should be every once and a while in my opinion. Thank gosh it was during the DATE2 because me and him did it a few more times just too be brats too mom and dad. Lastly, I remember this one time in NUM4 grade when my best friend CAPS4 was moving. I cried for days and days. Then finally he calls me and we talked for about NUM5 hours, and talking too him just made me laugh, and wish that he hadn't of moved. At least I still got too talk too him. Only about once or twice though. anyway, those times talking too him made me so happy. We talked about his dogs. One of his dogs names is CAPS5, she was about NUM6 months at the time. She started chasing her tail and when she went around about NUM6 times, she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. So, to end this trip down memory lane. Those three blasts from the pasts were the ones that made me laugh too help me feel better when I was feeling upset, or down.",0
"The question everyone is asking if computers benfit society? I believe that computers dont because you cant get exercise if youre always on the computers and CAPS2's really hard to enjoy nature too. Another reason comuters don't benefit society is that you aren't interacting with friends and family. hopfully I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family. If you are always on the computer how are you going to get exercise? CAPS2's proven that more than half of united states of CAPS1 is over weight. Exercising is more important than using the computer and knowing that you could be doing something use that you know is better wouldn't you do CAPS2? Interacting with poeple is important to do because you can meet new people and if you don;t then you might learn to be shy and not make as much friends as you like CAPS2's true taht oyu can make new friends over the computer but CAPS2's not the some meeting them in person. Also if you do make a ""friends"" over the internet, you don't know if they are a stalker or a murderer. I urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet. knowing that you are better off not using the computer and being with the poeple you like, wouldn't you do CAPS2? Yes you can play games on the computer but CAPS2 would be ebtter if you play CAPS2 with your fmaily.

"The builders faced many obstacles while trying to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph fourteen, nature was the biggest obstacle the builders faced. The ""violent air currents"" would cause dirigibles to move around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered. Another obstacle faced, was that the architects couldn't just add a mooring mast to the top of the building; over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building's framework. Lastly, as stated in paragraph thirteen, most dirigibles from outside the LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, even though it was flammable.

"Nearly every person has seen, heard, wrote, or said something that offended someone. Most of the people that offened others do it on perpose in there music, books, or movies. While some other people accdeltly offened people by the way the worded somedthing. If someone finds something offensive, they should ask for it to be placed somewhere else so it is still avaible, ask for a vote to remove it from the shelves, or just keep it to themselves until they know their not to only one offeneded.     When someone gets offened by something they see and hear in a library, that person should ask for relocation for the offensive meteral they seen or heared. In this case, other people can still watch, hear, or read the book or magazine, movie, or music. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else.     A book or magazine, song, or movie could be offensive to a lot of people, so it should be voted to be removed or stay in the labrary. This way the materal has a chance to be avaible in the future. Some music and movies could get removed then replaced with the censered version so it for the people that were not offened.     In some cases there is only one person that got offeneded by something that was in a library. In these cases the person could chose to wait to until someone else is offeneded by the materal to speek up about it's offensiveness.     If materal is offensive to someone they should get it relocated, voted on, or hold their peace. If relocated the materal is still avaible to other people. When voted one it could stay or be removed. Someone can speek up about the offensive materal after someone else find it offensive as well.",0

"I think there should be no books taken off the shelfs. Somethings might be offisive to some people but other people might need those books for a research, projects,etc. People need to read to understand why some people think that somethings are offensive toward other people. Every book should be on a book shelf in a public library. Everybody has the freedom to choose for thier self, let them decide if it is offensive to them and others.     Maybe an author wrote a book about gansters, and their kids. Maybe the author wrote the book to give you an inside look on somebody's life. We live in a very diverse world they are going to be different outlooks on the world. The author could be writing the book to show you what that child went throught during that point of life with killings, and violence. That should not be offensive to somebody because they are talking about killings and violence. Reading that book should let you see how that child grew up. The book could even change some of the childs parents who are in gangs their minds. It could let them realize how it will have an effect on their childs life later on in life.     I believe the same thing goes for movies and magazines. Through reading the magazines and watching movies it could help you. Say if you are in a gang and you watch movies and read you would find out what happens to the gang, it could change your thoughts. These books, movies, magazines could show what is going to happen to you. Maybe directiors writers do these types ot thngs to show you what will happen to you if you continue down the path in gangs and harmful clubs.      Why should certain people get to choose if a book, moive, magazine,etc is offensive to some people but not others? I think the only way to fix it is to leave every book on public library shelfs. Let the peple who come to the library to read books decide what is right or offensive for them to read. Even if library's make a decision somebody is going to get mad and upset. I do not think there is any way to solve an issue like this except letting people read and decided for themself. If they like the book great, if not then  do not read it again or return the book.Nobody can decide right from wrong for somebody, only you can do it for your self.",0

"CAPS2 a world without computers. I picture it as a better place. Why wouldn't you want to make the world better. Computers MONTH1 be helpful for work and business but young children are losing time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. What do you prefer having computers or no? In my opinion people would be better off without them. Lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society. Computers is one factor to blame with the LOCATION1 already being one of the most obese countries in the world who would want to add on to this cotastrofy. If the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in LOCATION2 will as well. If computers take away exercise than health issues will more often and at a younger age. Dr. PERSON1 says ""if kids are spending more of their free time on the computer rather than increasing the risk of diabetes will increase for them"" CAPS3 it also a possible result in less exercise. Older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack. It is said that five out of six people could have stopped a heart attack just from taking same time out of their day to go to the gym or take a walk. No one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet. Less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day. If more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue. In my opinion the citizens of LOCATION2 would want to keep it more clean and be more about their. more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals. People would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature. Lastly when your on your computer all day you don't realize what nature has to offer fresh air and animals. Or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more, computer should not be in their way. Wouldn't most people that their relationships with family members and friends could be a lot stronger if they interacted and spent time with them instead of with their computer. CAPS2 how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family. Plus people need family. Your computer can't get you through the emotional pain if losing a loved one. PERCENT1 of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family. Last but not least your social life could improve if people werent on the computer all day. Not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around. No one wants to be that way. Also your computer might not be working all the time, but your family and friends always will be there. The world would be better off without computers. I think everyone that sits in their room on the computer could change their exercise, enjoy for nature, also family and friend relationships by getting off it and do things that they will actually benifit from. There is no need for a computer in your life, but don't speak for everyone. The question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good.",0

We finally came to an agreement that we had to get the money first , CAPS1 I went back to my house in LOCATION1 to make a plan to get four hundred dollars, my dad was doing the same, but he has a job CAPS1 its not that hard for him cause he gets paid. NUM4 a lot harder on me cause I have no job. CAPS1 I decided to fix my bike and go looking around for any jobs available. I went door to door to find people that needed any help around there house. I found a couple of people who needed some stuff done and CAPS2 both agreed to pay me fifty bucks, CAPS1 out of each I could get a hundred right off the bat.I had to haul a bunch of old tree branches and garbage away. When I was done I put that money in my pool savings for later. I also went to this place called ORGANIZATION1 and I was good friends with one of the kids that was related to them. I talked to him about him asking them if I could do any work for a little cash. CAPS2 said that ""I could go to every tree and put a pink tag on him and CAPS2 agreed to give me eighty five bucks.

"If we were to take away every thing that someone in the world finds offensive, there would be nothing left. Many people in different cultures find many different things offensive. it's not right to take away from others something becuase a select group of people take offense at it. Something being offensive isn't always a bad thing. There's many different reason why, but removing something because of someone else's opinion isn't right.     First, whether you find something offensive or not, is laregly based on your culture. To most CAPS1 cultures, declining food is offensive. To CAPS2, eating or hurting cows in anyway is a complete disgrace. If something is offensive to one person, it MONTH1 be because they have a different background. You're never going to please everyone.      Second, one of the best thing's about the LOCATION1 is that you can have your own beliefs. If something was removed from the shelf at a library, because someone found it offensive, I would be disturbed. I have my own beliefs that I'm sure not everyone agrees with. Some of my beliefs wuold be offensive to certain people. That doesn't mean I should have to stay silent about my beliefs, does it? No, of course not. I wouldn't want anyone else's beliefs forced on me. I'm sure no one wants my beliefs forced on them. By removing things from a shlef becuase took offense at it, you'd be removing freedom of speech from the shelf also. That's not only wrong, it's illegal.     Some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it. Some people would be offended by a CAPS3 cover with a pentgram. That doesn't mean they should be taken away. It's good to get offended sometimes. It often makes people stand up for what they believe. To me, it's reminder of why I believe what I do. I MONTH1 be angered by what I see. I'm sure the terrorist group ORGANIZATION1 is greatly offended when they see the CAPS4 flag. We wouldn't stop waving it, would we? That'd be absurd! Just because someone takes offense at something doesn't make it wrong. It never has. It just means they have different beliefs. We should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed.      I personally believe that removing things from the public eye, merely because they're offensive, would be wrong for many reasons. So many people find so many thigs offensive. It'd take away everythign if we removed eac and every one. Removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech. Plus, many things that are offensive often remind of of who we are. We should be string enough to look away and not fight about it. I don't think they should be removed. I want my library to be what CAPS5 was made to be, a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. I don't think anything should be removed unless it directly causes harm to people",0
"I was at ORGANIZATION1, waiting in line for a ride that I really wanted to go on I was a huge line! It was like a big line of domminus. I do not like waiting in big lines. Like most kids, I dont wine and fuss about waiting. In my head Im thinking when I whould get to go on the ride. I dont scream and shout though, I just try to stand still and wait. The second go on. tic tac tic tac. Just waiting for the line to get shorter and smaller. Minutes later it was finnaly my turn to go on the rollercoaster I was so exited! I went on the ride, it was fantastic! The only thing is that it was only a minute! that line that I had to wait in was like an hour. Well on well. That line was worth it.",0
"The CAPS2 is trying to describe his house when he was a kid. In this case he describes his Cuban heritage and how being CAPS1 is really fun and amazing. The CAPS2 is saying that the Cuban kitchen is pouring out with amazing foods and during holidays his ""Family"" would come and visit. Cuban is a very exciting culture is what pops into my head after reading this story. The mood is that festivitys and holidays are the best for him.",0
"The story is about a time I was patient. I am being patient right. I am being patient about waiting for CAPS1. Im not a person who ??? to be patient. When I want something I were that second. Cristmas is my favorite holiday. There is so much good stuff about it. There are cokkies, family and present. There is always a problem and my problem is I like to try and figure out what my present is. That is what stinks about being patient you are always waiting for something good to happen. All my family knows not to put anything in a bag for me because I will look in the bag easily and if they dont wrap it very good I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are yelling not to leave them unpackaged. Something also it seemes to be all holidays are like that. Well I guess we all have to be patient on something Im being patient on LOCATION1 football winning the CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4 and ORGANIZATION1 and flordia gators.

"Computers are a common household item these days. Due to how much computers are able to do, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people, their jobs are on computers. Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch. Computers can also keep you in from outside, to get fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in someways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a pefect resource. When your history teacher assigns you a NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happend in the civil war. In this case computers are good. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones. Computers seem like a perfect resource. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I belive, that a lot of things would be different in our society today.",0

"Builders of the Empire State Building never achieved their goal. They had failed to predict the potential problems that they would face. First of all, they couldn't proceed to attempt to land the dirigible on the Mooring Mast because it would be dangerous. Indeed, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph NUM1). They realized the complications it would imply if there were to be an incident like the one in New Jersey. Also, nature was an obstacle to the project; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents"" (paragraph NUM2). Consequently, due to the winds, the back of the dirigible would be swinging around the mooring mast, which would be a huge danger to the streets. As a final point, dirigibles wouldn't be able to moor at the Empire State Building because there was a pre-existing law concerning how low airships could fly over urban areas.",0
I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played against the bull dogs in LOCATION1. We were losing in first half and before first half got over one of our goalies got his hand hurt. So they took him out and they put in the other goalie and one of the other team players kicked the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach. So it knocked his wind out and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying that he was going to pass out and he just got his wind knocked out of him. So then out first goalie that got injure he had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie because they were to scared that they would score on them. After first half we scored NUM1 goals so we won NUM1 to NUM3 . The reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't.  The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it.,0
"To CAPS2 Or CAPS3 To CAPS2     CAPS5 it wrong to ban a book?  It has come to my notice that this CAPS5 exactly what our library has just thought about doing to any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that any person finds offensive.  To this I disagree.  The world CAPS5 a better place to live, when everyone has a level playing field.  Some information CAPS5 sensitive, but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the CAPS6 itself. Our country CAPS5 based on a freedom of press and speech, to deny that CAPS5 to deny our livelihood as a country.  To solve a situation as this, we must all create a type of checks and balances system to keep the information out there, but also protecting it from younger ones until the time CAPS5 right from a guardian's viewpoint.         Our country has many problems, but a few of them are CAPS3 the core values that are upheld in the CAPS6.  In the CAPS6 it CAPS5 stated that we have the freedom of press and speech.  This means that we can publish anything, no matter the inappropriateness of the matter.  This also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips.  There was just an example of this, inside the LOCATION1,when a local library had to allow any person wanting to look up porn on library computers because of the laws stated in the CAPS6.  However much some MONTH1 dislike the thought of this much freedom, we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some.     The world CAPS5 a contantly changing place, with almost nothing a given constant.  This CAPS5 the exact same for information of all types.  No one can say what will or won't be accepted in our society in the future.  At this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation.  The only problem with this CAPS5 the ease at which this type of information can be gotten.  The internet CAPS5 the very place where so much information passes through, be it good or bad.  To block all of this information just can't be done, but to restrict it CAPS5 our only hope.     To to create such a restriction, our library can needs to have a type of checks and balances sytem that could allow those with orderly consent or those of age to get a hold of these types of works. Those of age NUM1 or older could easily be allowed into sections containing these works, but those under NUM1 would have to have a guardian's consent before allowed in these sections.  A perfect example of this would be off of 'CAPS10 CAPS11 and The CAPS12 of CAPS13' when CAPS10 CAPS5 CAPS3 allowed in the restricted section of the library unless he has a signed pass from a teacher.  That type of protection would still allow the works to be released to the public, but still keeping the younger generation from having any freedom to look at inappropriate items for their age.     As humans we crave information, whether it be via watching, listening, or reading.  To block any part of this experience CAPS5 to block our full potential.  Many things are offensive, but then again much of life CAPS5 offensive.  Our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the CAPS6, and now we have a CAPS6 that protects all our information.  This CAPS5 a very good thing, but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them.  We need to protect our freedoms, but also protect our children.  To do this we must create a program that allows those that want view what they want, and those that are too young view what they are allowed by their guardians.",0

When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story.",0
"CAPS2 has been a debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for the people. Some people think that it benefits society because computers can teach hand eye coordination, they can help people learn about faraway places, and allow people to interact with friends. Al of this seems to prove that computers are good for society, but truely it is not. People who use their computers too much can have some harmed side effects, including obesity, red eyes, and even can get cyber bullied. People are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health. The number one problem of the LOCATION1 is obesity. It seems that people are getting fatter every day. Computers are definetly taking part in the problem. People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. These people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day. They start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are. This process continues until the certain person can barely yet out of their chair. Obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health, their eyes are being damaged also. It is obvious that more & more people are having problems with CAPS2 eyes everyday. Computers are making this happen. When a certain person is on the computer for only an hour, they are damaging their eyes tremendously. The computer screen is straining their eyes horribly & for the people who are on the computer NUM1 - DATE1 hours a day are pretty much sending their eyes to blindness. When I go onto the computer for only NUM2 minutes my eyes start to water. It is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much. Computers are damaging peoples health & CAPS2 should be something done about it. Although computers aren't only damaging people health they are also ruining peoples lives. Bullying has been a major problem in the LOCATION1 for many years. Kids would be bullyed all day in school and always had a horrible time. But when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends. Computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or ORGANIZATION2. This can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way. As I pointed out before kids are bullied a by in school but when they got home they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid. Not any more. This new ORGANIZATION2, video chat, CAPS4, etc. has brought the unlucky bullied students a one way ticket to getting cyber bullied. I have heard of a case where a student was cyber bullied to such an extent that she suicided on the internet to show how depressed she was. Computers made that event possible. Video chat, CAPS3, CAPS4, etc. gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide. I can understand why you would contradict my argument but I truely hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important. Obesity, straining the eyes, & cyber bullying should be in my mind enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines. They are causing a variety of problems in peoples health, mind, etc. I really hope you will consider writing this article.",0
"The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old mens help, and doesnt seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next town he hits doesnt have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasnt further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief.",0

"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. One obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified. After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the ORGANIZATION3 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The result of the expirament were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass. Within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles, as transportation, were long forgotten.",0
"The ORGANIZATION1 spire was originally built to be more than just visibly stimulating. The spire was actually a mooring mast to be used for docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were thought to be the transportation of the future, but the mast had many obstacles it had to overcome. Al Smith saw an opportunity to make the Empire State Building and all of New York on the fore front of modern travel. The mast would have to support and withstand a dirigibles weight so, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The constant threat of wind made the plans too dangerous as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Finally, most dirigibles were highly flammable and couldn't be safely docked with at endangering the public. A disaster like that would have been much worse..."" if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Building a mooring mast on the empire state building and many obstacles involved.",0
The author concludes that statement at  the story at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng wont give up just like the hibiscus.For example the hibiscus does its  best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts over in the spring.Saeng will also survive the winter and star all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author  wanted  to  show  the readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way that she has to start over and retry what she has failed as if the hibiscus had died in the winter.,0
"CAPS2 more and more people use computers people ask if computers actually benifit society. In my opinion I think computers do. They provide entertainment, acess to daily uses, and have many websites for social interactions. I think computers really do benefit society here in why. Computers provide entertainment to people. Many people will want to watch funny videos or thier favorite CAPS1 show on the internet. of the most popular website for watching videos on you tube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their or play them on websites like CAPS2 you can see entertainment on the computer has a much more compared to the CAPS1 were CAPS2 program is shown at a certain time instead of when ever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is acess to dailt uses, the internet provids that can tell you your local weather. Instead or local news imidiatly acess it on you CAPS4 you can acess encyclopedia and distionarys like at the websites CAPS5 provide an easy imidiats fools for daily uses. One least example towards the of computers Their are many websites that you can. One of CAPS5 websites is called , CAPS6 lets you upload picture of pople or family events for people in you MONTH1 video chat with people over a and see the other persons face. You can't do that on a telephone or with texting or a cell phone. Many experts believe that computers are taking away time with family and friends but with websites like CAPS6 it is actually adding time. In conclution, CAPS5 reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society, They provide entertainment, easy acess to and have many websites for social interactions, CAPS7 society would be alot harder and this is why I think computers benifit society.",0
"Experts are concerned about the use of computers. They say that they spend hours on the computer and less time exercising enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I agree. While people use the computers, they dont interact and meet new friends in person. They stay inside and don't get excersise, and kids might talk with strangers. When we use computers we chat with friends online and don't really interact with others. We meet new friends and chat online and never meet them and socialize, so that is one disadvantage of a computer. Another problem is lack of exercise. While we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise. Then we slowly begin to get unhealthy. Another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers. Some might meet some random people online and give them personal info. Kids might even meet with some of the strangers they talked to online and get hurt! well thank you for reading my opinions about computers. I hope you take them into consideration. Kids and even adults dont interact with freinds, lack exercise, and give personal information to strangers.",0
"The mood of the author Narciso Rodriguez was he was always proud of his culture and mom and dad. For example in paragraph two it talks about CAPS1 where he lived and how he said that he ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)"". ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). In the story PERSON2 always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile. And he was positive and honest. And he even talked about his community ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" And Narciso also said ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.""",0
The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence.,0
The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert. This caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated. The seconded way was that there were rough roads and hilly snotts this made him more tired faster. In conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit.,0
"The mood the author created in the memoir is a roller coaster. It goes up and down. At the beginning of this story, it was quit deppressing.

In the end, home is about relationships rather than physical space.",0
"The author creates a mood in this memoir. The author starts off with a mood that is kind of sad. He explains how his parents lived in a one-room apartment when they moved from Cuba to the United States and that there was a lot of segregation going on in the United States. The memoir gets happier as the author describes in paragraph NUM1 how friendly and close the people living around him were. The hardships of the author's parents are listed in paragraph NUM2. The fact that they had to start all over again is sadening. The author finishes of in paragraph NUM3 and NUM4 with a happy ending. He describes what he has learned from his parents and everything he is grateful for. For example, he learned the true meaning of ""family"". The mood that the author creates is very important to the memoir.",0
"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many obstacles of building the Empire State building as a docking station for dirigibles are describle. John Tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the empire state building forgot some very important things to take into account. First the entire building would have to be modified because ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stres to the building's frame"" (paragraph NUM1). The second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph NUM2.). If an accident like German dirigible Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph NUM3) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of ""forceful wind."" (paragraph NUM4). The obstacles of making the empire state building into a mooring mast caused too many obstacles that could not be solved.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacle while building it, some of those obstacles being saftey, the technology they had, and, the planning that they put into building the mooring mast. There problems with the safety of the mooring mast was that, dirigibles that were from countries other than the LOCATION1 use hydrogen instead of helium. Hidrogen is very flammable so the risk of a fire in the dirigible was very great. Also another problem the builders faced with safety was that the winds on top of the building would be much too great to succesfully land a dirigible. The problems that the builders faced with technology was that they didn't have the technology to succesfully land a DATE1 ft dirigible at the top of a tower using a single cable because it would add stress to the buildings frame, and the stress from the wind pressure would be hazardous to the buildings frame. The obstacles that the builders faced with the planning of the mooring mast was that they didn't plan well enough and that they should have seen that the mast would be a failure from the start.",0

"I think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them.           Somethings are ok for reading and learning although they are indeed offensive it is ok for these matrerials to be left on the shelves, if it will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun. It is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials. Not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing. If we took everyting off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers would there be many books that would keep peoples atention?       In conclusion I strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf. These materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention. Keep these items on the shelves!",0
"The new millenium brought a new wave of technology. Computers is the main invention that most likely everyone uses. The computers teach us great things such as learning about a vacation spot or a far off country. The computer allows us to talk to friends or family while they are away or even home. Also, typing on the computer teaches us hand eye coordination that can help us with other things. The computer is surely a great invention. Have you ever wanted to go on vacation to somewhere overseas? Well the computer is a great source for learning about these places. The effects it has could be significant. One day some one might want to go to the bahamas, but then finds a new location such as LOCATION1 or even LOCATION3. In addition the computer benefits students very well. Students usually have to do projects on places in the world and the computer is the main source of intelligence. When I have an essay to do I always use the computer first. Recently my grandmother moved down to LOCATION2 and I can only talk to her on the phone. Although on my computer I can actually see her on my screen. The webcam allows me to see me grandma. The computer allows you to keep in touch with friends and family that you do not see on a regular bases. For example CAPS1 or twitter keeps you in touch with friends from high school. The computer can also send emails to friends and family so you can say hello every once in a while. Sports require a great deal of hand eye coordination. The computer makes you better at this. By looking at the screen while typing, gives you a boost on your hand-eye coordination because you are doing two things at once. A sport that requires a lot of this is CAPS2. While the ball is in the air you must focus on it while holding your stick at the correct position. Although hand-eye coordination is mainly taught through the powers of the computer. To conclude, all that I would like to say is that the computer is a great source for intellegence. It also allows you to keep in touch with high school friends and far away family. Finally, the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer is a very important piece of technology.",0
"Have you ever just read a book or a magazine that you just despised and thought that if that book was taken off of the shelf then it would save many people from a waste of time? Or have you ever read a book or heard a song that was not offensive to you, but to other people it might be offensive to their race or gender? A lot of people run into this problem and personally, I have ran into that problem, but that doesn't mean it needs to be taken off of the shelf. If everybody in the world goes to a library and grabs one book off of their own local library shelf to go and throw away, just one, that they absolutely despise because of their own personal reason or just because they didn't like it, there would barely be any books left!

I understand that some books MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but do not read it if you take it to offense. Books about slavery MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but that is history and some people might like learning about that subject, or MONTH1 even need that information for a research project. There are also many books on the CAPS1, some people MONTH1 find that offensive, or MONTH1 not want their kids reading about that, but that is history. It's a time period in the past and it MONTH1 be something a high school student is doing a research paper over. I have done a research paper over the CAPS1 and I have read some very mature material that younger kids MONTH1 not need to learn about right now, but I would not suggest to take every book over the CAPS1 off of the shelves at our local library.     There are many different reasons for reading a book and if you want to read a book for enjoyment and you end up reading one that you find offensive, then choose a different topic to read about because some people MONTH1 like reading about that topic. Just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic the book covers does not give anyone the right to take the book off of the shelf because they feel that it is sending a bad message to younger kids or might be offending to some people. If people do not want their kids reading about that topic then tell them when they go to check a book out at the library not to get a book over that topic.      If it becomes too big of a deal to where people begin to find a lot of books that offend them or other people, then suggest for the library to have a list of the books and their topics. Each library could be required to have a list of books, and have the suggested age of the readers beside it, or there could be different sections of the library. One section for kids, one section for teenagers, one section for adults, and one section for middle aged people. Also, if it absolutely needs to happen, each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about. This will give you an idea of what the book is about before you read it so if there is a certain topic that offends you then you can go ahead and find another book and find out what that one is about. This would help many people not read books that offend them and it would help them find a book that is more suitable for what they want to read about.      Songs are a whole other subject. An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing songs about what they want. If people find the profanity in the song offensive, then do not listen to it. There is no way that you can tell a song writer not to sing or rap about what they want, and stores are going to sell albums that give them business. If people do not want their kids around that kind of language or message that the song is giving off then they can just tell their kids not to listen to it, because artists are going to write songs, rap songs, and sing songs about what is going to make them money, and that is just a fact.",0
"I would like to say that my first subject is communication, computers allow us to talk to everyday folks or folks that are around the world! There are many ways to talk, text, speech, and webcam, and it is not like you cannot talk to them there are hundreds of communication cients, servers online NUM1 usually, so you will always be able to someone! Secondly, I would like to say computers have a great way of creation. On a computer you can program CAPS3, design presentations, documents, drawings, maps, graphs, almost anything you put you mind to can be virtually made. You can gather information from servers websites, CAPS1, CAPS2 CAPS3 you can create and learn a lot on your everyday computer. I am not fisned! There are CAPS4, CAPS5, CAPS6, reading, book sites all on the web! This gives the opprotunity of the ""web searcher"" to have a vast ammount of information! and allow he or she to learn alot more in every day life. Finaly, I would like to say that computers has a wide range of entertennent! There are many to choose from like videos, movies, CAPS18, CAPS1, games anything that is suitable for the user or users of the computer. On a game a user MONTH1 talk to friends, while CAPS14 a game such as a (CAPS8 CAPS9) for example CAPS10 CAPS11 CAPS12 online, CAPS13 CAPS14 game. These kinds of games skyrocket entertennent lovers for the vast ammount of enjoyment they can endure while CAPS14 a CAPS8 CAPS9. Another type of entertennent is videos people can watch videos and movies on a video and more website which has a database of not thousands but millions of videos and movies. Whatever the user wants is a text and a click away! The last type of entertennent is CAPS1 and CAPS18, these allow the user to daily life or take to friends, family or relatives. To sum this all up I would like to tell you Local news paper that you should agree that computers are a good thing for the society! Please reread and pick the right CAPS2!",0

"I think laughter is good for a relationships and here is why . When I first got to CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 i was trying to be myself and make friends. One day I was in class and CAPS4 came into my class room and came up to me and she started talking to me and I started laughing .The she told me that she liked my laugh so she stared laughing like me. So that I would laugh more an CAPS5 felt good knowing that she was making fun of my laugh she was enjoying CAPS5 . She was trying to get me to laugh cause she thought CAPS5 was funny because she had never heard anyone laugh like that. Everyone has a different laugh i have two laughs which she found out funny . CAPS5 was the best day of my life because i was being myself and I know she wasn't laughing at me. Every time she hears me laugh she laughs and tries to make me laugh so that she can laugh and we all have a good time. For me CAPS5 is funny because lot's of people don't notice how other people laugh.  CAPS5 feel good that she noticed and liked CAPS5 and wanted to have a good time. Most people when they make fun of someone they say hurtful things CAPS4 wanted to make me laugh again i know she wasn't making fun of me. She just thought CAPS5 was unique and funny but not a haha you are weird funny but like a omg i love your laugh, its cute and funny. Now every time she sees me she tries to make me laugh CAPS5 makes me feel good every time she does CAPS5.When you are new at CAPS3 good to make other people laugh specially when its not at you directly. To be honest CAPS5 made me feel like people were startling to like me and not knowing me as ""the new kid"" but as a human being an actual person and that they say me for me not for what i wanna be or for what people see me as. That's all i could really ask for. So my opinion is yes laughter is good for relationships CAPS5 shows that you have a sense of humor and that there is a actual person inside that body not just bones.  Another reason is CAPS5 shows your personalty your real self. Isn't that what people, to want people to see them for who they are not what people say there are.At least that's what i want. that's why i will never forget that class period. CAPS4 showed me that if i just laugh with other people ill know that the aren't laughing at me like making fun of me they are saying that i am funny. That's what people want is to see people for who they are.  The teacher was a substitute for that day and she kept on getting mad at us for laughing but we couldn't help CAPS5 because CAPS5 was so funny. That period i laughed the whole time. I was laughing so CAPS8 that i peed my pants a little. She made fish faces and sounds like she pretended to be a monkey in a tree. She laughed how I laugh she did everything to make me laugh. CAPS5 was so funny CAPS5 took up the whole period. That's is how much i was laughing.  I got up and was going to go to the bathroom and when i got back she was still there and i sat down and so she started making me laugh. So then i sat down and CAPS7 and PERSON1 came in and there was something in his pocket and i poked at CAPS5 and said what is that its CAPS8. We all started laughing cause CAPS5 was funny CAPS5 was is wallet. I didn't get why they were still laughing when I stopped but then I continued to still laugh because the way they were laughing. We all were laughing and then we all stopped at the same time and because we all stopped at the same time we all started laughing cause CAPS5 was funny.The sub came and stood there by us and we all got quit and then started laughing again. I think that the reason why we were laughing was because we were doing dumb stuff. I turned around to do my work and then CAPS4 spinned me around so that i would start laughing again. Then i started laughing again CAPS5 I started crying. I was laughing so CAPS8. CAPS4 started laughing so CAPS8 that she started laughing. At the end of the period I had to pee so bad. CAPS4 wouldn't let me go she just kept on making me laugh more and more. Sometimes just laughing for no reason is the most fun. I guss my whole belief is that laughter is one of the best things that a person can do. Not only is CAPS5 fun but CAPS5 is also a very healthy thing to do.",0
"The features of the setting in the essay, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this mans journey he was confident in his abilities. I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey.",0
"They say laughter is the best medicine CAPS15 I personally think that's true. For one jokes are a great thing fro laughter but it depends on the joke sometimes because some jokes are extremely funny CAPS15 some or CAPS14 plain horrible. Another reason why laughter is CAPS5 great is when your laughing that automatically means that your in a good mood CAPS15 i love to be happy or in a good mood i hate being all mad CAPS15 upset it CAPS14 isn't me. I CAPS14 love it when i cant breathe i am laughing CAPS5 hard those are the best jokes also you CAPS11 about wet your self especially if your extremely ticklish CAPS15 i know quite a few people that are CAPS15 i feel sorry for them because i would be down right embarrassed if i wet myself in front of anyone. My whole life has had laughter in it to me anytime is laughter time.  Well I have quite a few stories about laughter but i am only gonna tell you one CAPS15 its one of my favorites its when me CAPS15 my friends are all hanging out at at mt grandmas house for my NUM1 birthday party CAPS15 were all having a great time on the homemade slip CAPS15 slide the food CAPS15 the drinks (soda of coarse not alcohol). But anyway my cousin PERSON1 has these games that he came up with like the CAPS1 relay , CAPS2 fishing , CAPS3 the gum in the whip cream, CAPS15 my favorite CAPS4. CAPS4 is a game where you CAPS11 have as many players as you want CAPS15 all the supplies you need are a lot of sting a lot of balloons CAPS15 one person to start out as the CAPS4. CAPS5 say you have NUM2 humans CAPS15 one CAPS4 all the humans would have balloons tied around their waists CAPS15 they all try CAPS15 run away from the CAPS4 CAPS15 the CAPS11 hide anywhere inside the boundaries CAPS15 it doesn't matter how your balloon pops who pops it or what pops it once it is popped CAPS6 your a CAPS4 until there are CAPS12 humans left CAPS6 you start a new game. Now you might ask yourself why this is funny CAPS15 now I am gonna tell you why. CAPS5 were all at my party having a great time right CAPS5 my cousin PERSON1 says ""CAPS5 who wants to play the game CAPS4? "" CAPS6 we all say well whats that?"" CAPS6 he goes over all the rules like a said before CAPS15 we say ""lets play."" CAPS5 me CAPS15 my friend CAPS9 are running away CAPS15 all of the sudden we start hearing my cousins CAPS4 noise that means he coming CAPS15 he freaked out CAPS15 ran away CAPS6 when he leaves you CAPS14 hear the screeching scream come out CAPS15 you here his balloon pop that means that he got out CAPS15 were all CAPS14 laughing because when he flew he launched about NUM3 feet backwards it was the funniest thing ever because when i got over there he was still on the ground CAPS15 everyone CAPS14 it trying to breathe i swear i think everyone was about to wet them selves CAPS15 the probably would've laughed some more if it wasn't for the game CAPS15 CAPS6 CAPS9 got up CAPS15 started chasing people with my cousin PERSON1 CAPS15 the rest of us CAPS14 ran out of there as quickly as possible CAPS15 yet again you here my cousin making his CAPS4 noise CAPS15 people running CAPS15 screaming CAPS15 my friend make trying to make the same CAPS4 noise but cant CAPS15 one by one i hear the balloons popping CAPS15 soon i was the last one left CAPS15 i was gonna give up CAPS5 i am CAPS14 getting chased CAPS15 chased until i am completely out of breath CAPS15 CAPS6 one of my friends ORGANIZATION1 comes up in front of me CAPS15 i CAPS14 said ""I don't care CAPS14 get me out i CAPS14 wanna lay down."" CAPS5 he took the balloon CAPS15 CAPS14 popped it CAPS15 i asked ""CAPS11 i take a nap?"" CAPS15 he said ""CAPS12 because we have to get ready for the next round CAPS5 you better rest up quick or you'll be dogging."" CAPS5 i CAPS14 rested up as much as i could before we got everyone straped up for the next game i was hoping to get some kind of reward for winning the very first game of CAPS4 but CAPS12 my cousin PERSON1 had to be a samrt alic about it CAPS15 say"" CAPS14 getting to play the game isn't a big enough reward for you stingy!""CAPS15 as always everyone starts CAPS14 busting up laughing at every single little thing that my cousin PERSON1 does but i do have to admit that he is one of the funniest guys that i have ever met. CAPS5 there you go there is my story about laughter but i do have plenty more but i think ive wasted to much of your time CAPS5 thats all i have to say.",0
"The builders faced many problems in their attempts to allow a dirigible to land at the Empire State Building. One of the main reasons was safety, ""most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I would have been to large of a risk to allow such a dirigible over New York. Another problem was the air currents, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A final problem was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would forever prohibit any airship to dock with the mast, or even approach the city to attempt to dock.",0
"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.",0
"I have had to be patient many times in my life. One that I can remember was waiting in a long line for opening of CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS6 for this DATE1. The line must have at least NUM1 people. This is one of the largest apple orchard in the area I lived in. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her also. Her name is PERSON1. The opening was going to be at TIME1, and it was only NUM2, the line still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster. I glanced at my watch almost every NUM3 second. Time seemed to forget to keep ticking. Finally, it was NUM4. That was when we heard an announcement. Beep! CAPS4 ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up CAPS3 CAPS6 in NUM3 more minutes. Im sorry. Thanks for your cooperation click. I heard everyone in the line groan. A lot of the people just left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, PERSON1 and I just sat down to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! CAPS4 once again! Are you ready for some CAPS3? Then come on in! Its time for CAPS3 CAPS9! That was my story of being patient.",0
"Should someones work catagorized as 'inappropiate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not able to be sold or seen in stores? If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for CAPS1 be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries.     When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing. Just as when CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropiate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live CAPS3.      Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or cd's with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered. Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try.     When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not if your talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available.      If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ad's and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biography's then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropiate' then the song writers and actors will more then likely not have the urge to do it all over again.     In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone belives that an item is 'inappropiate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropiate' and they think its funny. Surely if the write or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropiate.'",0

"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were some of the following. They needed an exact way of getting everything perfect for the job. The whole building process for this job was very complicating and needed the best expertese.In paragraph NUM1, Al Smith's quote greatly backs up to my point. He says ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast"". It tells just how much people are working on this job.In conclusion, this was a complicated job. They weren't positive if the mast even be able to stay. They also werent positive if the fluids inside would be but a problem factor.",0
"I think people are spending to much time on the compture an these are my reasons, Less time exercising, an enjoying nature and interacting with friends an family. My reason is less time exercising people are to busy on the computer playing games an talking to other ones. Dont you think you should be outside doing some exercising like running around or playing sports instead of being in your house on the comptuer doing nothing. People should at lest get NUM1 of exercising. You could be on the comptuer for a little while but not on it NUM2. Take a break from the comptuer an go outside for a little bit injoy the weather an being outside. People just cant take NUM1 away from there comptuer time I find that really hard to belive that people cant. Its like the comptuer took over there brains an all they want to do is be on it an never get off. My second reason is enjoying the nature go outside for a little bit an see whats going on there go take a walk outside in the woods an look for the animals or look for animal tracks. There are a lot of fun things you can do outside like climb a tree or going fruit picking. You dont have to be inside all day an stare at the computer playing games an talking to friends. You could be outside injoying the nice weather you are getting. Peopl need to learn that there is better things to do with there time. My third reason is that interacting with friends an family. It inportant you spend time with them an see how they been an what they been up to. But instead people are always to busy to talk to there family members becuse they are always on the comptuer doing stuff they dont need to being doing. There are a lot more inportant things in life an people need to understand that. Family is way more inportant then being on the computer but people these days they put family second because they never want to talk to them or see them because they are always so busy waisting there time on the comptuer. Like checking there email is fine but waisting your time on these chat things like CAPS1 or CAPS2 or CAPS3 its just a waist of your time people can hang out an do things they dont have to be on the computer asking there friends that they should just call them an ask. Dont get me wrong I have a CAPS2 to an it takes away from your hanging with family an things but I make time for I can hang out with friends an family an enjoy the natuer an I do exercis. So I dont see why its so hard for people to do that. So in conclusion I think that people do waist there time on the comptuer to much like I said there are more inportants things in life an things you can be doing like exercising, Enjoying natuer an hanging with friends an family. So I hope you take my ideas an consider them an thank you for listening to what I think. I hope people can get it through there head that they dont have to be on the comptuer NUM4.",0
"Real life is rated CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? If a library feels that if a book is too graphic, a movie too violent or that music to agressive then its their own choice to remove it or not. It is true that that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers.Explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature. The never ending game of shielding this generations teenagers and children is already finished.     In this point in time, the main focus of alot of movies and music and books is something violent, agressive, inapproiate, or explicit. The idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless. The will always be violence and crime in todays world along with excessive swares and cuss words all around. It's exceptable that some parents don't want their children reading,watching or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of but even if the kids are protected and home out in the world sometimes the parents wont be there.     Libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frusterated or angr if the books, music or movies they liked were no longer avalable due to the cencorship. It MONTH1 seem as if viewing, reading or listening to something violent or explicit, would have an effect on the listener. On the streets, at school, at the park and more places children and teens will be exposed to this type or explicit language so attempting to cencor it in their reading and viewing matterial is just pointless.        In my experence I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies and more explicit material and not been effected. I saw my first rated CAPS1 movie when i was nine, so parents can give thier kids somewhat of an age but at one point trying to cencor anything is a waste of time. With schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and the sexual deseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to. Any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inapproite material, explicit canotent, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images.     Real life is rated CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? Trying to block the explicity and violence in the world is an endless battle. Certain things MONTH1 go over the line, but others are just renactments and previews of whats really going on in this world.Why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers? Movies have a rating and music CAPS4 have an explicit content label so people should know whats approiate for themselves. The first sware word a child hears probably wasnt in a song or movie and was probably somewhere in the real world.",0
"I do believe that certain materials should be taken of the shelves if they are found offensive. I think children should only be able to read certain books cause, some books say things should know until they get older.Some books, music, movies , magazines should be removed if offensive. I think they shouldnt make some kids movies , books, music like that for little kids. They put to many things they should not  in kids movies.     The movie the CAPS1 they should not let kids watch that movie its not a movie i would let my kids see until they was older.The reason why is cause it has alot of  bad language in it . It is about these guys who take ruphies. This guy cheats on his girlfriend, and it is just not a movie that i would let my kids watch.There are people getting drunk in the movie . they do stupied things.They try to make it look like its a good thing to do and that it is so fun to do all those things. I just think that is not a movie to let kids watch.   Some music has to much bad language in it. I think they should make better songs for kids. Songs that really mean something or about someone. Most of these songs they sing now is about dumb things that do not mean anything.I think some magazines are okay to read but some just talk about actors. Like PERSON1 I read one time about here doing something that was bad, and she should not be doing. I think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it.   I believe that if they are offensive they should be taken of the shelves. I also think that if they are not offensive and do not talk about bad things kids should be able to see them or read them. If they did that kids would not talk and do things like they do today.That  kids would not try to stell and things like they do in these movies they see it happen or there friends do it. So they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that but, it is not.",0

I then CAPS35 to do the same thing, but with no effect to PERSON1. ""CAPS19 isn't CAPS5 working?"" I ask. ""CAPS26 I'm awesome like that CAPS3 CAPS18're NUM2 says. ""CAPS6, CAPS28 I'm gonna keep at CAPS5 until I get CAPS5 right."" CAPS9 I CAPS35 to mimic everything I saw him do, but to no avail. All I made happen was I spilled CAPS11 hot chocolate all over myself, which made him laugh, albeit not the way I wanted to. ""CAPS18 want me to CAPS22 CAPS18?"" PERSON1 says. ""CAPS31!!!! Please!"" I beg. ""CAPS6, CAPS33't say I didn't warn CAPS18."" CAPS34 proceeds then to grab another chip CAPS3 while looking at me from the corner of his eye, bites the chip. I start laughing uncontrollably then CAPS3 without pause. After about NUM1 minutes I stop laughing.   ""I'll get that right!"" I say. PERSON1 says,""CAPS35 CAPS5."" I grab a chip CAPS3 look straight at him CAPS3 bite down, nothing. I CAPS35 again, this time while looking at him from the corner of CAPS11 eye, nothing yet again. I CAPS7 to myself, ""CAPS36 I CAPS33't get CAPS5 this time I'm giving up."" ""CAPS6, here goes."" I grab a chip CAPS3 slowly bring CAPS5 to CAPS11 mouth while squinting at him from the corner of CAPS11 eye. I bite the chip. I notice CAPS34's laughing. CAPS34's laughing!!!

"In the DATE1 on the month of DATE2, I experienced laughter on a grand scale. If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of CAPS1, when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began normally as any CAPS1, when all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I lobbying around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity, I just enjoyed. People, my family, looked upon me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept distance from me. Though I continued I still felt a sense of worry, for if I had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wish would vanish from my being. Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself, see the sane person I use to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews. So onward I continued in my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, yet it differed in my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released, a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowed into my soul, my alter-ego coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name PERSON1, and with these new emotions that came with I accomplished great feats. Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives strength to me, by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me. I view him, as not another person so to say, however as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise. I do believe that we all have this person, this personality within us, empowering us to drive forth and never look back.End.",0
"The CAPS1 sets a good mood in this memoir about his house.the CAPS1 states the house is a sign of life and love. The CAPS1 states, ""always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love."" The CAPS1 explains the mood by a Cuban feast. Also when he learns that in the neighborhood there is love to. The CAPS1 states, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The CAPS1 shows how many cultures and countrys show satisfaction in the whole neiborhood that is filled with mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in the LOCATION1. The CAPS1 shows a good positive, and geneorus mood in the book that has all started in the kitchen with a Cuban feast.",0
"I believe that not all books should be banned, but some books should. For example their are many good books that are banned because it MONTH1 have a little bit of cussing in them but I believe that is ok, I mean it isn't like the child wouldn't hear the same words maybe even worse if he turned on his CAPS1. But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someones religion.     For example I read a very famous book called The CAPS2 of PERSON3 by PERSON4. This was a very good book but for some reason it was banned in my ORGANIZATION1 CAPS4 so I couldn't check it out. I had to go to the CAPS3 CAPS4 to get it. I don't understand what is so wrong with The CAPS2 of PERSON3 that it is banned by ORGANIZATION2. This book MONTH1 talk of a mischevious youngster who runs away, does alot of differnt crazy activites, and even smokes but this is no worst then what we are exposed too on CAPS1.     If I was a administrator in a ORGANIZATION1 I would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express. For example if a book is offensive to some one for instance a book written by the PERSON1, this piece shouldn't be aloud on the shelve. But if it is a book about the CAPS7 CAPS8 and the ORGANIZATION3's view on slavery this would be ok. Because the PERSON2 book is more hate than anything it is for instance promoting the PERSON2 and that isnt right. But the book on the CAPS7 CAPS8 and the ORGANIZATION3's view on slavery is a part of our history it shows differnt ways of thinking of the time that we don't really know if they were right or wrong it is just what they believed.     So my point I am trying to express in this piece is that don't hate a book because maybe the language in it or the events in it MONTH1 not be what you agree with but judge the book because of the message that it is trying to express.Hopefully you will agree with me in this.     But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someones religion. I have expressed my opinion on this matter I hope you agree with me and can maybe convince the ORGANIZATION1 that they need to take a second look at what kind of books we keep on our shelves and what kind of books we take off our shelves.",0
"Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclist have many obsticles to over come while riding. One obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclist are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Going off  road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge. In the short story Do Exceed posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie also has another example for an obsticle cyclist have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, I eased past, trying to keep by balance in my dehydrated state (CAPS1 NUM1). The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike. In conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead.",0

"From the idea of building the Empire State Building to attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced different obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith thought it was a good idea to add a mooring mast so dirigibles could dock there for several hours. However, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, builders had to transmit all the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building could add stress to the frame of the building. One of the greatest obstacle builders faced was the wind or nature. The strength of the wind were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For safety reason, most dirigibles weren't safe because they mostly used hydrogen and hydrogen is flammable. Another obstacle they faced was an existing law that didn't allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. Irving Clavan said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Due to the obstacles the builders faced, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles disappeared.",0
"Some people MONTH1 think that certain book, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they MONTH1 be found offensive. I believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of 'offensive' material.      What really makes something offensive? If someone were to tell me that it looked as if I've lost weight, I would find that offensive. The person wouldn't have meant it that way, though. Although I would have found it slighly rude, another person MONTH1 have found it to be a nice compliment. With this logic, can one really conclude that anything is truely offensive? By saying something is offensive, you're stating your own opinion. Even if they aren't the same as everyone else's, everyone is intitled to their own opinions; equality is something most people find very important. Because of this, one person's definiton of offensive shouldn't be held higher than another's. If we rid libraries of 'offensive' material, that is exactly what you would be doing; you'd be making one person's definition of offensive superior to another person's.      I also believe libraries should not get rid of 'offensive' material because by doing so, they would probably be getting rid of a lot of interesting material. Let's use my religious beliefs for an example. I am CAPS1 CAPS2. Basically, I do not believe in 'CAPS3'. If someone were to write a book about my religion, I would find it interesting. Some CAPS4 MONTH1 find it to be offensive, though. So if a library got rid of that book because someone found it offensive, I wouldn't want to go there as often. When I go to a library, I want to find a book that I'd enjoy reading. If all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library, would there really be anything left? If so, I doubt many people would find it interesting.      I also believe this because by taking a book off the shelf because you find it offensive, wouldn't you be offending the author? As I said before, everyone is intitled to their own opinions. Because of this, libraries should allow authors to speak their minds. By taking their books off the shelves, you'd be offending them. They took their time and effort to think about and write that book, and for you to offend them by taking it off the shelf, you'd be controdicting the entire purpose of removing it from the shelf.      In conclusion, I believe that nothing can truely be defined as offensive. Also, people should be able to speak their minds. Therefore, libraries should not attempt to rid there shelves of 'offensive' material",0
"I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.",0

"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe this because we can talk to people in different countries in a quarter of a second, we can send e-mails to other people, and finally we can go to LOCATION1, ask CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. First, we can talk to people in different countries. Did you ever have a relative go on vacation in a foreigh country and have no way of calling them to see if everything is okay? Lets say for instance that they brought their laptops but for at their cellphones. Then, the only way we can contact them is by e-mail. Even if your just happens in you can keep in touch through email. You can even a computer so you can video chat, and not have to wait to get your reply. Next, we can send e-mails to other people. Have you ever set somebody a letter by mail and had to wait two to three days for a reply? Sometimes, your letter is even lost, and these is no way of finding out. Well with e-mail, the wait time of your reply depends on how fast the person whom you are talking to types and most people I know can type a reply in NUM1 to NUM2 seconds. I believe that is a from two to three cars. With e-mail those is an eghty three percent chance that your email will not be lost. If for some reason it is lost, there will be a message sent to you telling you that your message was lost and that you need to sent a new message. But most likely chances are that your message wil reach its destination. can go to LOCATION1, ask CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. Were you ever wondering about something and the answer was on the tip of your tongue but you just cant think of it? If so you probably would be smart to go to LOCATION1. You can ask CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. And I mean CAPS1 question you can ask questions from wat the price of is in LOCATION2, to what an is. If you wanted to you could ask math questions as well, such as what is the square root of pi, and what is NUM3. From LOCATION1 to myspace the internet is full of information that can have a positive effect on people. This is why I think that the has a positive effect on people, we can talk to people different countries we can send e-mails, and we can ask all sorts of questions.",0

"Should the librari be censord on the books it has on the shelvs? I think it should be. There are many offensive books and thangs on the shelvs. I wouldnt want my kid or anybody els kid reading offensive books. So lets get rid of all the bad stuff or atleast filtyer it all.     I beleve any book, movie and magazines that have alot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be cheked out to a certion age. If they wana keep teh books on the shelves they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permsion slip to get the books. Removing teh  books and thangs complitly MONTH1 cause to much troubl so we should defntly make sure the kid is a certian age and has permsion.     I would not want my NUM1 year old kid read a book with bad language in it. Kids cach on to that stuff and they will start talking like that and it would not be a good thing. There is alot going on in socaty now a days that badly influnce children. They do not need to read about how guys rob places and are crimanals. I think thats why we have so much of a probly to day becouse evry one sees it at a young age and they want to be lyk that wehn tehy get older but that is a very bad thing. They do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good. If we do not filter wat they do at a young age they will end up being hellins and outa of countral becouse they will think just becouse someone in a book or movie did it that its ok for them to do it but its not.     I would not wnat a young kid to read bad things. I say lets put a ge limit on them and mack our socity beeter and are kids to become beter adoults later on in ther life.

"As a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is a wonderful resource. Multiple variaties of books MONTH1 be found at a local library from documantaries to science-fictoin or just fiction. The most amazing part of a library is the fact that one MONTH1 choose what he or she reads. Yet if one man opposses the view in one book and believes a certain book should be removed from the library, then the freedom of choice is lost. The selection of reading should be open to every reader, and although some MONTH1 disagree, heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary meassure that constricts the ability to gain knowlegde.     In today's society, many people differ in taste or genre. So much so, that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting. The library is a place where people MONTH1 be able to enjoy their diferences, reading different types of books spread across many shelves. Yet if one person dilikes a book, their opinion should not influence the removal of the book due to their preference. Author Katherine Paterson made a wise remark on the idea of censorship saying, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books'(no pag.). If one person finds a work to be vulgar and believes it shuld be removed from the library, then what stops another person from removing a book that they dislike? If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, then libraries will become diminished resources, only containing a few documents.      Still, censoring age specific materials is necessary in libraries. Allowing a child to read or watch a movie or book that is inapropriate, is an inexscusable action. Censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though. Removing a book from the shelf of a library is just as wrong as allowing a child to read a book that is too mature for his or her age. Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none osf our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'(no pag.). The censoring of books in a library cannot lead to the removal of books that have shaped our society and ideas, even if it is to protect a child. A medium must be found between true censorship and opinionated removal of books, due to one's belifes. Doing so will not only help libraries but also society.     There are many different opinions in modern society and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas, at times people will disagree. Yet it is important that poeple agree on allowing each other to have a choice. A very important choice that each individual makes on a daily basis is what to read. Libraries allow for people to make their choices and help to expand one's knowledge in the process. Literature, whether it is found in a library or at one's home should never be cast out due to someone else's opinion. Censoring of libraris should be considered, but not at the exspence of knowledge. Libraries should not be censored.",0
"Laughter CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4 ""CAPS5, we've got something to tell CAPS3."" I knew CAPS9 they were about to tell me. I saw the signs. I knew that CAPS8 they went into the other room, CAPS6 wasn't for some quality time together. They were getting a divorce CAPS11 the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words ""We are getting a divorce,"" rang in my head like church bells CAPS8 a couple is getting married. The happiest sound CAPS3 could ever hear. But that was the exact opposite of CAPS9 was going on right now. As I looked up into the face of my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue, gray mixture used to meet CAPS11 become one, CAPS6 had turned red CAPS11 irritated. CAPS6 killed me inside to see her crying, CAPS11 while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell that he was thinking that he was so in love CAPS11 that CAPS6 all just went downhill, leaving him with an intense feeling of resentment CAPS11 anger towards my mother. The love of his life, was now his enemy.  At seven I couldn't fully wrap my mind around CAPS9 was happening to our family. I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand CAPS7 this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. If I was confused, he had to of been off on another planet. At the thought of my family crumbling before my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. If a genie had been there to grant my three wishes, I would of used all three of them if I thought there would be a possibility to save my parents relationship.  Crying just seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say ,""CAPS6's not your fault, don't blame yourself, this is between your father CAPS11 I."" CAPS7 did they think those statements made CAPS6 better? Because CAPS6 really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, CAPS11 the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in LOCATION1. Plus, there was still the underlying factor that my home was broken. CAPS11 more importantly than my home, my heart. CAPS6 was broken CAPS11 I didn't think there was enough super glue in the whole world to pull the pieces back together.  Just CAPS8 CAPS6 felt like the whole world was going to crash down upon me, my mother said something to me that I CAPS1 never forget. ""CAPS8 CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as afamily."" One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. CAPS8 dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. The time CAPS8 mom CAPS11 I made sugar cookies in the winter that ended up burnt, but still made the whole house feel warm CAPS11 familiar. CAPS11 especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. The one that forever changed their lives CAPS11 mine.  I began to laugh, CAPS11 then to cry. My parents weren't sure CAPS9 to think about my sudden change of emotion. They asked ,""CAPS9's wrong, CAPS10?"" CAPS11 I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, that we would still laugh. That CAPS8 someone slipped on a piece of paper, CAPS6 would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, CAPS11 the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. That with laughter in our lives, CAPS11 memories in our hearts, we would survive this.  From then on, i solely believed in that one statement spoken to me by my mother. ""CAPS8 CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh."" The statement that said to me, CAPS6's okay to be sad, but that as long as CAPS3 have laughter in your life, everything CAPS1 be alright. In my heart, I applauded my mom for handling that situation so well. If CAPS6 had not been for her, I would of kept on with the water works CAPS11 never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to just take a moment out of every day to remember each punch line to every corny joke, CAPS6 CAPS1 CAPS2 CAPS3 CAPS4.",0
"I believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves. I feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not. I have also been in this position where I came cross an article that upset me. Also I have had an arguement once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them.    Once when I was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that I grew up in. The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent. This upest me and made me feel ashamed for living there. But I thought more and more that this article was someone elses opinion. That just because they wrote that article, doesn't make it true.    This arguement went out of hand. She had her opinion and I also had mine. My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework. While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artists cd. I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was. My friend went to my sterio and turned it off. She told me she didnt like it and that it was offensive music. So after that we pretty much argued the whole time. I finally said that I feel its great music and I shouldnt have to stop listening to it. We had a deal that while she was there I wouldnt listen to it, I felt I would respect her feelings.    Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are putting their opinion into it. Sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say. I mean if it is on the shelf and dislike it, dont pick it up and read it.",0

"Patient is very important if there were no patience everyone would be irritated all the time. if there were no patience we wouldn`t be able to get through the day we would be constantly looking at the clock thinking when am I going to get out.

That could affect how everyone acts toward each other no patience could affect the littlest things we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like. It`s also going threw life without saying why can`t I do what or you can`t because I can`t. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience.",0

"In the memoir the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood.

Also by how he feels so confortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner to call them family.",0
"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building faced the obstacles of the use of hydrogen in dirigibles in which is highly flammable, nature itself, and an existing law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.It stated in paragraph NUM1 of the excerpt, most dirigibles outside the united state used hydrogen, which is very flammable. Realizing that this kind of happening above an outrageously populated area such as New York City would be extremely dangerous. To explicate. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"".However, the greatest obstale was nature itself. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting. which was certainly not safe. For example, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The builders soon realized that this issue could unfortunately, not be resolved.Lastly, a more apparent obsticle that the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to even approach the area.The obstacles of the use of hydrogen, nature itself, and an existing law, made it impossible for Al Smith's plan to become realistic.",0

So for his birthday I decided an getting him a computer. It's been NUM1 month since his he had his computer and CAPS8 he was trying to hit a baseball at his sons party, he moneged to hit the ball NUM2 out of NUM3 where he used to hit it NUM1 or NUM5 out of NUM6. PERCENT2 is a termendous increase in only NUM1 month! Just something CAPS8 simple CAPS8 a computer improved CAPS7 friends hand-eye coordination a termendous amount. Secondly, the computer can help you learn about far away places CAPS8 the LOCATION1 or LOCATION4. Do you really want to travel up to the icey cold, and piercing winds of the LOCATION1 just to learn about it? For some I'd say like that but what if you cant travel up the LOCATION1 due to money or flying conditions. I want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry. A statics from the CAPS3 CAPS4 of CAPS5 states ""PERCENT2 of people wpould love to experience the thrill and excitement of the ORGANIZATION1 lights. But out of those PERCENT2 only PERCENT3 said they'd actually travel to LOCATION2 to see them"". So you can see that PERCENT4 of those people wouldn't go whether it be due to money or the cold. Thery CAPS6 said thats why they love the computer. They can experience the ORGANIZATION1 lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold.Lastly, that better thing to do on the computer than with family you've never met before or don't get to see them. The editor for the LOCATION3 Local states ""CAPS7 parents live over NUM8 miles away. I rarly get to tell to them now because I can't afford to travel that distance ofter. So I use CAPS7 computer, CAPS7 parents and I now communicate PERCENT1 more than we used to. I love the computer it helps keep me close to CAPS7 loved ones."" CAPS8 you can tell, thanks to the computer we talk PERCENT1 more to his parents than he used to! In conclusion, the computer is a gracous device that is extremely benifital to people. The computer teaches us hand-eye coordination, lets us learn about places we other wise would never learn about, and to have conversations with friends or family that we generally dont get to see often. Now you go out and make anyone that says computers are a horrible inventions you tell them exactly why computers are so important!",0
"A time when I was patient was when we were leaving on vacation. It seemed like I had been waiting forever to go to LOCATION1, really it had only been about a month. I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to LOCATION1 was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldnt sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling.  Finally we loaded up the car and left for LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost NUM1 days. But it was worth it, LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty. We also went to ORGANIZATION1 and had an awesome time. I had to be patient at ORGANIZATION1 since there were long lines for the rides, so we had to wait a while. I had a really fun  time in LOCATION1!",0
"There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he come by. but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. This had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut havent peen out for awhile. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a ""desert in California in June."" The cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water. The hills also had an affect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. The Welchs building also had an affect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the National Park.",0

"To whom it MONTH1 concern;      As a student, I find myself reading frequently: at home, at school, in the library, in the car, basically any place I can get my hands on a novel. However, the novels that I have read are not always novels I have chosen for my personal gain. I must admit, I am not an avid reader on my own. I am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me. Many of the books I choose are relatable to reality, which often involves content that MONTH1 be considered explicit. I believe books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be taken off shelves.      As CAPS1 citizens, we have the right to free speech. This allows us the freedom to speak our mind and express our thoughts without restricting our personalities.This law allows authors and producers the right to base their work on what they want. Media that MONTH1 be considered explicit is appealing to a variety of people, and to some it is considered disturbing. With the freedom we have as CAPS2, we have the choice to see said movies, or read said books, but we also have the choice to avoid those situations. When producers produce movies containing sexual content, language, or violence, they aren't producing the movie, expecting every citizen to see it. They know some citizens are against that content. There is no law forcing us to see movies that we do not desire to see. We have the ability to choose what we want and do not want.      Explicit material is available everywhere you look. Walking in LOCATION2 and LOCATION3, we see books, music, and magazines lining the walls, most containing explicit material. Though many novels contain explicit material, there are still numerous amounts that do not. People complain about explicit content in novels when in actuality, there are many novels without explicit content. We are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations. We lead pessimistic lifestyles. Citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible. Look for the good in situations. There is an abundance of media that contains no explicit content or sexual material and we are given warnings as to what contains and does not contain this material. These warnings are required! Labels such as CAPS3 or CAPS4 are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision. Parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in. They can set rules for their children, saying they MONTH1 only see CAPS3 rated movies, or they have to have parental consent to read a magazine or novel. Parents are guardians for a reason; they need to monitor their child and care for him or her. If they do not like the music, novels, movies, etc. that their child watches, change it! They have the authority and right to do so. Instead of taking explicit material off the market to everyone, limit what you, personally, want to be off limits to your family on your own, and talk to them about it!     Katherine Paterson is completely correct when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf. . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we were given the right to remove and books, movies, magazines, etc. that we do not believe should be on the market, it is likely that we would have no media anymore. With the billions of citizens we have in LOCATION1 alone, each individual is bound to find some flaw in a certain book. With each flaw found, we would want to eliminate that book, movie, or magazine from society, thus leaving us with no variety of material to choose from. People who feel strongly about eliminating explicit material would act quickly upon this law, rather than people who are against it. This would create a corrupt society, with a lot of fighting. We, as humans, enjoy the freedoms we are given and the choices we are allowed to make. Taking the freedom of what we read or watch away from us would take away or personality and sense of expression. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to be read based on opinion, and it should remain that way.     Books, movies, and magazines should be allowed to stay on the market even when they include explicit material. The choice to read or watch this material is up to the person, and should have no influence on other humans opinions.",0

It was just about one week ago when I got into a fight with my best friend in the world. And later that day I realized that we were both.

"Many things are said to bring people together. These things can vary from favorite foods to fashion taste or even disliking the same people, but nothing can bring two people as close as a good laugh can. Laughing will always lighten the mood, bring out a winning smile and from time to time, a tear to the eye. Laughing makes the bad days manageable and the great days fantastic. In my perspective, the world wouldn't go around without a good laugh every now and then. By 'good laugh', I CAPS5't mean the kind that makes you happy for a moment, I mean the kind that brings tears to your eyes and creates a shaking feeling in your stomach. The kind of laugh that you remember. I've had many of those moments, but one that I cherish most just happened to occur during a school day. A couple weeks ago I was having a pretty nice day, sure its CAPS1 so the weather dampened my spirits a little, but I was doing alright. I had my normal classes, got my average homework load, and then it came time for CAPS2. CAPS2 is basically study hall at my school. I sit at a round table in there with a few of my friends and we talk about nearly everything. Everyday, I sit by PERSON1. PERSON1 and I occasionally sit and talk with everyone else, but we tend to disingage ourselfs from the others and lock ourselves in our own private world of inside jokes, smart ass laughs and people watching. So that day during CAPS2, I can't quite recall what we were talking about at our table, we all just couldn't keep ourselfs from laughing. Most of the laughing was just giggles, and some of it was straight up, hardcore red faced laughing. After we all settled down from the most recent up roar of chuckling, PERSON1 started talking. She somehow spit out the words, ""CAPS4 it you guys! You're making my eyes hurt!"" amoungst the giggles still blossoming out of her mouth. After she said that, I became puzzled.I just stared at her and stuttered, ""...what?"". I was sure she made a mistake and said eyes instead of stomach, but after she replied with ""CAPS5't your eyes hurt when you laugh really hard?!"" I lost control. I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe and I felt like I was going to pee! See, the funny part is, PERSON1 is CAPS6. So the idea of her eyes hurting from laughing really hard is just uncontrollably funny. After PERSON1 and I caught our breath, we asked other CAPS7 around the room if their eyes hurt when they laugh and guess what? They CAPS8! This only made us laugh harder. This occasion instantly became another inside joke we treasure.That inside joke is by far one of the funniest ones, and it being funny, just makes it funnier! Everytime she laughs I ask, ""CAPS8 your eyes hurt?"" and we just burst into more laughter. The idea of the joke alone brings a smile to my face, that being the reason why laughing is such a big part in our world. It brings happiness, joy and love. Well, actually it brings just about every possitive emotion. I MONTH1 not be a doctor yet, but I know I'm right when I say; everyone should get their daily dose of laughter. Laughter can cure just about anything.",0
Alot of people are offeneded by things that are uncenored.  Some peopole think they should be censored and others think it  should not.  Its all a matter of opinion.  I dont think anything should be censored because it takes away from the freedom of speech.     With censorship one can not fully express there self or opinion.  that is way nothing should be censored,0
"Have you ever been running late to a party and just realize you don't have the directions to the person's house? Have you ever had to write a paper and there wen't any books or encyclopedias available? Or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend? CAPS1 you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable CAPS2 and the can be fun too. To begin with let's go back to that example in the paragraph above. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the direction's to the person's house? CAPS1 you have, there are two things you can do in that situation. You can call up the person who probably wan't answer because they're CAPS4 fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in and you will have your directions in seconds. Call me crazy, but this way seems quicker more efficient and reliable. My mother always says to me, ""CAPS1 you're CAPS4 trouble finding CAPS2, go on the computer,"" because she knows that there is all the CAPS2 in books on the CAPS3, and more. And it's just one click away, CAPS4 sold that, the computer has positive effects on you because it gives you quick and reliable CAPS2 In addition, computers have positive effects on you when you're trying to have fun. For example, CAPS5. CAPS5 is used by teens and adults like, and for one reason only, to socialize with friends via computer. CAPS1 you to another date and wait to see what your last friend's up the best thing to do would be to go on CAPS5 and ask A ORGANIZATION1 shows that in a family of five, four of them use the CAPS3 to communicate and socialize with friends. Obviously, this is how computers have a positive effect. In conclusion, whether you're bored at home and it's a rainy day, or CAPS1 you have to nght a research paper you saved until the last minute, a computer will be there for you. Positive effects computers have - are that they are quick and reliable, and they are fun to use.",0
"The construction of the mast was intentionally a good idea, but the people who where constructing it never actually realized the true dangers of the whole idea.Although they should have known, they should have realized that because the ship was attahed to the mast in one area, the ship was bound to swing around when it comes to a windy day because of the lack of weight. The builders also had to keep in mind that because the idea was huge, they had to make it perfect. They had to realize that many other builder are going to try this con cept which means they have to lead by example. If not then the other builders would have major problems people would be in danger.The builders and men who thought about using weights to balence off the weight of the ship.

"In my opinion, books that MONTH1 seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf. Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or MONTH1 come off as offensive.      A person should be able to read an article without feeling like somone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable. Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. Well say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with. If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down. No one is forcing you to read it or look at it.      People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them. Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people. If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelfs of library's there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person.      Movies are a whole other issue in itself. There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. If you do not cuss and say you go watch 'CAPS1 CAPS2' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word. If you do not like CAPS4 people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch 'CAPS3.' CAPS4 people find movies offensive or not to their liking the usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth. The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable.      In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it. Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other peoples, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you. In my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to",0
"Computers are a great invention but people are starting to dislike it. On the hand, I believe the computers put positive effects on people. First of all, they are a great way for kids to have fun: CAPS1, people can learn very interesting facts. Lastly, it is a great way to communicate with friends and family. These are a few reasons I think computers put a positive effect on people. To begin with on a computer you can have a lot of fun by playing games. The computer saves money for a lot of us. For example, if you bought a game system it would cost well over MONEY1 but on a computor you can find and play games for free. Not all games have to be like ""CAPS2 of CAPS3"" or ""CAPS2 of CAPS5"" they can be games about sports. Supose one student broke his leg and he love playing soccer. He could just on the computer and play a game of soccer even though he has a broken leg. People can CAPS1 learn various facts right from their computers. The most important thing that computors are made for is to learn new things. No one in the CAPS2 knows everything, but if every one put what they know into the computer than people can get learne any thing from them, I remember CAPS6 my friend once told me about some guy named PERSON2. I had no idea who he was so my friend started laughing at me, CAPS6 I got home I searched him up and by the time I was done reading about him I knew more than my friend about PERSON2. If he ever have a question in class and our teacher can't answer it heshe always tells us to either ""CAPS7"" it or ""CAPS8"" it. They both are search engines. Not only can you learn a lot from computers you can CAPS1 communicate with people from different countries. What if PERSON1 did not invent the telephone? How different would our life be me right now? Anyway most people use the computer to communicate nowadays. Whether it CAPS9 or CAPS10, or whether its ORGANIZATION1 or CAPS11 all are a great way to communicate with people. With tele phones it costs money to talk with people in a different country, but with the roputer it is absolutely freen. You could be living in LOCATION1 and chatting with someone in LOCATION5. You could live in LOCATION2 and email someone in LOCATION3. Communication every where is fast and easy with the computer. My whole family lives in LOCATION6 and it costs us twice as much to make a call there. CAPS6 we use the computer it is even better because they can even see our fare throught the webcam. As you can see, computers are not negitive at all for all I know is that help people around the CAPS2. They help kids have fun with the games we can play. CAPS1, it teaches children and adults various now things. Lastly, it is a great communication strategy. I hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so every one can see how computers have a positive effect on people.",0
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is nostalgic, warm, and thankful. In the memoir the author explains the importance of family, recounts his experiences with family, and thanks his family for all the important life lesson they have taught him. In paragraph two the author says: ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This excerpt conveys a feeling of nostalgia and warmth as the author praises his childhood home. In paragraph three the author says: ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This sentence also makes the reader feel nostalgic and warm because the author really gives the reader a sense of his childhood community's unity and love. In paragraph five the author says: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" In this sentence the author really conveys his CAPS1 of thanks of his parents to the reader as he praises them. In paragraph six the author says: ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and Friends are.""

And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" These excerpts really sum up the author's CAPS1 about family.

"I am writing to you because computers are affecting humans in many ways. Some can be terrible, and others not so bad. Many average people are now staying inside all day on the computer playing games, or on facebook and other interactive websites such as twitter and CAPS1.

"Living in todays society there are many diffrent people and many diffrent outlooks on things, the world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions. There are an uncountable number of diffrent ways people look at the world and ways that people percieve things. To tell someone what they should and should not know is simple minded in the aspect that anyone can percieve a book, music, movie, or magazine diffrently.     CAPS3 quote by Katherine Paterson,in short, metophorically uses a book and a shelf to let the reader comprehend the importance of information that is passed down from generation to generation. The book represents the information in the world and the shelf stands for the the place the imformation is stored for one to go seek information.     To remove the book off the shelf indefinatly is to close the mind of a future generation. It was once said ' you can not know your present without knowing your future.' CAPS1 the book MONTH1 offend one reader it could also inspire another as well. Everyone has a diffrent opinion and life style. CAPS1 CAPS2 people are granted with better lifestyles than others, CAPS2 are unfortunatly living everyday in struggle.      One book that MONTH1 offend a person who thinks the book is harsh and should be taken off the shelf, could also inspire a young child going through struggle's to overcome there surroundings and be a better person.      I have read many books that did not interest me and passed them on to my sibligs and friends. Shockingly the book interested them. After interviewing my siblings and friend over the book it turns out that they got a diffrent message from the book than I. No one thinks the same thoughts a hundred percent of the time.      'CAPS2 MONTH1 argue that the glass is half empty while others argue it is half full.' CAPS3 quote is a perfect example of the minds of the world today. Ultimatly if everyone thought the same then everyone would be the same person. To 'leave no books left on the shelf for any of us' is like programing a robot to only do what you say.      In such a diverse community it is impossible to remove any book off the shelf.

"Society is always dealing with what is appropriate and what is not. We witness things of that nature every day even when we are not trying to. It is the classic argument between two parties trying to prove eachother wrong, what is admissable and what is not. We should try with all our efforts to keep inapporpriate books off of our shelves and out of the hands of the young population.     People can be influenced to do just about anything. There are too many of these tales to pick out even one. The interesting thing is people can be affected by someone indirectly. Whether it be through television, music, or books, man can be molded into something through what they are conditioned to believe.      The influences one encounters can be either positive or negative. As a lowly person who only wants what is best for society, I know that movies with criminal acts or explicit images do not help anyone become a better citizen. It is no different with books. Books that have politically incorrect messages are in no sense better than movies that achieve the same goal.     I am not in any way against reading books, rather I am quite on the contrary. Reading is overall good for mental and social health because it allows us to explore things deep inside of us that are often rendered useless in our fast-paced world. But if one is constantly overexposed to books that are against our very human nature, they should be removed for the good of the people around us. If one cannot find a book to read that is not deemed appropriate, then he or she needs to take a look at themselves. There are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also can have a positive influence on one as well.     We as members of the ORGANIZATION1 are already in enough trouble as it is with all our financial troubles and what not. We do not need to add more to the table when we let the population gain access to obsene books that would typically make someone only rebellious to society. If something is making the people of our lands more riotous than it should immediately be censored or removed from society in general. Believe it or not, there are ways to have fun and get a good message across at the same time!",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there and those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable landing area in LOCATION1, a mooring mast was needed to the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and to let passengers on and off, The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand-foot blimp mooring at the top of the building held by a cable tether would cause stress to the building frame. The blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below. The last obstacle in the allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.",0

Patience is difficult to do. Waiting in line for something or waiting for a letter to come in the mail. A time when I had to use patiences was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could and I only ended up with NUM1 lines. I couldnt think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arive in NUM2 to NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time. One day NUM2 months from when I sent the poem in I got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond. Anyways I kept reading and it said that I used patience.,0
There I was on a cold DATE1 TIME1. Still almost pitch black. I was hunting in my blind with my dad so quiet we could hear a pin drop. I had to be very patient cause even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We were sitting there for almost NUM1 hours not even making a sound. To me being patient was hard but I did it. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came by. I had to be patient and wait till his head went down so I could stand up and shoot it. That took about NUM2 minutes. But it was worth it cause I finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some deer for dinner.,0
ear news paper I think computers good for you because you can use the internet and myspace and videos and some school work like math and essays so yes I do think that computers are good for you because you can do all kind of things on computers. And computers can help you with school a lot and you can print out lots of things and why computers can help you is with your math writing spelling and most defyntly is science and ant also literature. The reason why I chose those NUM1 things is because you can look those NUM1 things up on. Computer and get the answer to math and spelling right like read NUM3 helps you write and spell thats one at the reasons why I like computers because I can get on read NUM3 and I love doing read NUM3 a lot and I like the read NUM3 class also because the computers sometimes I like reading on the computers but not all the time but I have to read that's how I'll first learn how to read by forsing my self forward to read. That's how I'll first learned how to read by computers and putting forse to my self. That's why computers is more important to me and look words up.,0
"In the story Winter Hibiscus, the author concludes the story with, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The authors reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories from Saengs homeland comforts her. So much that they she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous. it was like walking into another world, said Saeng, when she entered the florist shop, after failing her drivers test. It was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants, flowers. The flowers take her to a happy peace and make her feel at home. Like everything is going to be alright. This is  why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test.",0

"Is it understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age?  No it is not the whole situation of wether or not libraries should have things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to certain people due to there age should not be an issue.  My reasoning on that is not because of how it MONTH1 influence people in a bad way.  Then again it MONTH1 influence them in a fantastic way.          Thats how people find out who they are such as, what their interested in, what they like, and what they want to do.  If it wasnt for establishments such as libraries most people would be the same as the others and not have a sense of character to themselves. People would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others.  People should be aware of some of the content in books. Just not to the point were those areas become restricted to certain age groups.  Movies and cds are more understandable do to the actual graphic violence and language that some musicans and actors MONTH1 use.  Except in a book its not what other people are doing and saying its what you yourself is reading and how you yourself is interperating it.  It takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what your reading and how your reading it.     Thats why the whole situation of wether or not libraries certain things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to a certain age group, but instead having the ares labeled on what the category is to know before looking.  So therefor that is my views and beleifs on why or why not libraries should be restricted to certain people.",0

"I think computers have affect on people because firstly, it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, gives online games to little kids. Lastly you can wacth video's that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example if I want to go to LOCATION4 for the DATE1 and I know nothing about the place I can go online and look up I can look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even there landscapes. Also the computer is good for book reports if your teacher told you to do a book report on LOCATION5 instead of going in your text books, goion line you can look up their culture, there food, there location, how is there economy like, what kinds of school the kids go to what kinds of festivals they have etc. My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example there are NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer and that is CAPS1, and CAPS2 these two allows you to talk to friends that live faraway from you, my friend lives in LOCATION1 and I live in LOCATION2 we don't have cellphones so we go online to eiether CAPS1, or CAPS2 ""isn't that great""!!. The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistic say the PERCENT2 to PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids. Also when kids play computer games it more fun to them then sitting in class all day like my litt",0
In the memoir the author created the mood of being happy and joyfull. One reason I feel this way is by the way he talks about what goes on in his home. Like when he talks about the hart of the home being the kitchen and how his parents passed on the skills and a love for cooking to him in paragraph NUM1. Another reason I feel this way is the way he describes the types of friendships he has with is neighborhood. Like in paragraph NUM2 he talks about how all of the different cultures come together and have great friendships with each other. As I read this it makes me think of all the fun and joyfull things that happened at my house and wonder what else will happen at my house in the future.,0

Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and upon reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and in the neighborhood of zoo degrees. CAPS1 setting-related issue for kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for mile until he was able to find a spot with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate.",0
"Many things about the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts. This contributes to the cyclist nagging sensation for a drink of water. The ride on the hills and through the desert, also tire him out dramatically. Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is tarlike and ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist in this story really must want to get Yosemite National park if he is willing to go all through all this trouble.

"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a ceartain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the moood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood realitives. It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family. They always came over and had dinner babysat him and every thing that is why it is love.",0
"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the greatest being safety. As stated in paragraph NUM1, most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable. Also another issue was purposed in paragraph NUM2, this was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered down, the back of of the ship would swivel around the morning mass. Yet another obstacle as to the reason why dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building was in paragraph NUM3, this was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles made it nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to serve it's original purpose.",0

"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced such as the high winds, and how they could dock the dirigibles when it is against the law to fly an aircraft to low near urban areas. one obstacle the builders faced was the safety of the dirigibles anchoring above busy streets filled with people and high winds. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable, so any foreign dirigible that was anchored at the Empire State building would cause a safety issue because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur causing the dirigible to blow up and potentially endanger pedestrians. Another obstacle the builders faced is the law that made it illegal for dirigibles to ever dock at building because it was illegal for aircrafts to fly to low near urban areas and it would have been a long process to ever get the government to let them.",0

"I believe that they should not be pulled off of the shelf if they are found to be offensive. Many people have there own taste in what they like to read, write and do. Therefore, there should be a wide variety of these things on the shelfs so people can do what they enjoy best.     Books and magazines MONTH1 be offensive, but they MONTH1 also entice the reader. i personally love books about drugs, sex, and many other inappropriate things. In fact my favorite book is banned from my school library. If they took all inappropriate books out of they library. What would i read? not everything can be just peachy kin all the time. Its not in real life, so why should we have to read a little fantasy world that we know isnt true? I know i would'nt want to read that.      Just like books and magazines, every one has their own taste in music. some like country, classical, metal, and maybe even rock. If you took the songs that were offensive off the shelf that would make people angry. That's like not playing a song on the radio thats offensive, and many songs played on the radio are degradeing to women. if it can be played on the radio. Why cant it be in a library? there going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway.     Most movies these days are very gory or offensive in many aspects. Many people are interested in these movies. If you can watch that movie in a movie theatre, why cant you check it out of a library? Some people go to check out movies that are shown in school so they can watch it if they were absent. What would they do if that movie got taken off the shelf? Fail? I know i would become angry if that would happen to me.     Keep offensive books, music, movies, and magazines on the library shelfs. People will eventually see them, hear them, and watch them even if its not in the library. Even if you take out offensive materials there still going to get them sooner or later no matter what you do",0

"There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was the stress added to the building's frame when the dirigible wore it at the top of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to rearrange the frame to make it work. Consequently, the workers were never able to accomplish the goal. Safety was a major factor in the failure to dock dirigibles at the ORGANIZATION1 dirigibles were highly flammable which could have caused a serious accident to occur. However, the ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" CAPS1 there were heavy air currents above the building, it would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"" when attached to the mooring mast. There was also an existing law that prohibited planes to fly low over city areas, which of making impossible for dirigibles to reach the building.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, while trying to build a dock for dirigible. One problem was safety. While American dirigibles used helium, other countries filled their dirigibles with highly flamable helium. If a dirigible were to ignite in a heavily populated area like New York City, the result would be deadly. Nature also caused problems with the mooring mast. The winds above the building were too strong and ever-changing, and could potentially destroy the dirigibles. Finally, federal laws stated that an air craft could not dock that close to a building. These three factors made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles docked there. Based on excerpt, one of these obstacles were the lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. If they got close enough to tie up, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers because of the fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell. Also, for the dirigible to be added, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework.",0

"What's your first thought when you're thinking about a library? Is it quiet, peace, or calm? Many people would think that until they come opon a certain book, magazine, movie, etc. They would start reading, and soon read something that is completely offensive. Books, magazines, movies, etc. should be censored and removed from a library if found offensive.     Although everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I believe that a library is a place of peace. Having offensive literature in a library makes it look as though it's a bit trashy. If people want to read a certain magazine or book that offends a large sum of people, then they should go somewhere besides a library to find it.      When I was younger, I participated in events at our local library; such as seeing who could read the most books over a certain amount of time, or other events like that. I liked to explore the library and find new things. I remember back then, and still today, there were always a large amount of magazines sitting on selfs, categorized into their correct sections. Many of them showing half-dressed women and men. Now, I understand that people like to know what is going on in the real world and like to be up to date, but I believe that they can go elsewhere to find such magazines. Having these offensive magazines in libraries for children to see is not good, and could easliy upset the parents of the children.     Another reason why books, magazines, and others should be censored is because they MONTH1 influence teens to do wrong andor bad things. For example, many books talk about drugs and smoking. If teens read this, they MONTH1 start thinking that it isn't wrong to do these things. If these type of books were to be removed from libraries, then I believe that the number of bad things that teens are influenced by would be greatly decreased because they aren't going to read them.     In my personal opinion, libraries would be better if books, magazines, movies, etc. would be censored. Not only would it make people happier, it would make the world better. Besides, if you are looking to read something bad, you shouldn't be looking in a library anyway!",0
"To who it MONTH1 concer, I am writing this to inform about how the ocmputers benefits society. I think computers aren't that great because people use certain websites. People use CAPS1 messaging and its also a way getting connected to others. I also think that some people ae addicted because you can search someone or CAPS5. You find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users who use the computers. Some computers are bad education to some kids who are trying to learn majority of kids use computers for internet access most kids will be on the computer playing games that MONTH1 not be suitable for the age group. My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use. For example: CAPS2, CAPS3, ORGANIZATION1, ect. Many people use websites to check the emails. For exmaple: ORGANIZATION2, LOCATION1L, CAPS4.mail, ect. My other reason to you why people use websites is for CAPS1 messaging. People sue CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, & other people they MONTH1 not know. People say its a faster connection to people MONTH1 not could reach. For example: person doesn't have a phone, the person does not live close by & the person lives in another town. I also think it good research to browse people. For example you know someone but you can't find you can browse. Another second one is people maybe addicted. For example: they go on website & they go on it over & over & over again. they don't stop using it until it gone. In additional people think it keeps them busy. For example you don't have anything to do go on the computer. Lastly you find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users. For example, you find a website but its not suitable for minor. Only CAPS5 adults could watch. One more thing computers aren't bad education. For example you can learn from apropriate websites that builds brain muscles. My opinion is that I do think computers benift the society because it mainly helps you brain storm & you get to know websites & learn about them.",0
"I think that laughter is a key element to any lasting relationship, because if you didnt have laughter then that would be one boring relationship. Let me share with you a personal story of my own.  I recently just started dating my boyfriend and his name is CAPS1. We first met here at school and then he transfered and moved away, then a few months ago he added me on facebook and we started talking again. At the time we had started talking he had a girlfriend but shortly after finding me again he realized that she was not the one for him anymore. It was rough for him to break up with her but he did it and i am proud of him, becuase she treated him very bad.  In the beggining of our relationship we were both really shy and didnt talk much but the more and more that we hang out the more we start talking. We want to be the type of couple that can talk to each other about anything in person the way that we do in texts. Everytime i see him i get really nervous and it almost seeems as if my heart skips a beat. Whenever we are walking down a street i cannot help but to smile. And when we lay on the cowtch and watch movies i can't help but to laugh when he tickles me. We laugh at each other all the time, wether its when one of us makes a mistake or what not. I believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us going strong. Everytime he leaves i cannot wait to see him again. Laughter is what keeps most relationships going because without it i feel like it would be a really boing and if it is boring than you wouldn't want to spend time with one another. I personally think that every moment with your significant other should be fully taken advantage of.",0
"The mood that was crea ted by the author was love, and inspiration The mood was love because throughout the whole story he told his parents that he loved them and was proud of them. he feels proud of them because of all they do for him and the family. So he is proud of them. he is also greatful to have parents like this because they do so much for him they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration this mood is created because of what he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perservirence. this means that he is proud of his parents and he is thankful for what they do for him, he says tha he is thankful for all they have sacrificed. These are some examples of the mood that was created.",0

"CAPS2 is no doubt that computers don'CAPS6 benefit society. First of all, most people only have a limited amount of time to things. Secondly, many friends would get mad if you can'CAPS6 see them. Last but not least, you have to watch out for your health. To sum up, computers aren'CAPS6 always a good thing. From my point of view, time is a big thing. When people get so involved with something, its hard to back away. Thats just like smoking. The nicotine attracks you so once you start, it is very hard to quit. Many lazy people like to put things on hold. In other words, you waste time. The time that you could be spending on homework or even working on a job, your wasting it. Other people know that they need to do something but keep putting it off. For example, you need to paint your house or fix the motor in the car but you keep putting it off. NUM1 out of NUM2 people do this in LOCATION1 everyday. As you of all people can see, many CAPS3 don'CAPS6 think too much about time. The next big topic is CAPS4. You and I both know that every one needs a CAPS5. When you don'CAPS6 interact with your Friends, your friends might not bother trying to talk to you. The might not even go near you if you forget about them. Pets on the other hand need you. They usually just sleep around the house when they are lonely. I'm sure that you know pets need love and need you to play with them. Parents need to be CAPS2 for their kids. When you were little, didn'CAPS6 you need help? I know I did. Thats why parents need to interact a lot. In conclusion, the more you stick with your friends and stay away from the computer the better you will be. That leads us to the next big topic, health. Staying healthy's no joke. If you want to live long and watch you rkids grow up, the healthier you are the hotter you'll be. Everyone needs exercise. Exercise helps prevent against diseases as well as keepin gyou in shape. NUM3 out of NUM1 eople are over weight. When you are sitting in front of a computer screenplay games or sending e-mails, that's just as as palying video games on your CAPS6.V. You know as well as anyone, most video games are not good for you. Last but not least, most people don'CAPS6 eat healthy when they play video games or go on the computer. You and I both know, a healthy diet and exersice will give you a happy life. From my point of view, computers don'CAPS6 benefit society. Time is a big thing which many CAPS3 don'CAPS6 realize. Secondly, CAPS4 which everyone needs is another important thing to look into. Last but no least, everyone everywhere needds to stay healthy. For a long happy life. As you can see, many people would be better off without computers!",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was that the dirigible would have to be held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the building's frame in order to make the frame or sturdy, there was modifications to the building's framework which cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was the dirigible's use of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Since New York was a densely populated area, this would not work out well. The dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights. In order to do so, the lead weights would end up dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was a safety issue one last obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area.",0

"People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated 'CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into.      If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturty on the material. Levels are letters, such as 'CAPS1' for mature. 'CAPS1' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song. With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear.     Stores won't let kids under the age of NUM1 buy a rated CAPS4 movie. Rated CAPS4 stands for sexual act, language, and blood. It can stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated CAPS4 movie, but senice the law says a NUM1 year old kid should be aloud to watch it, then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it.     We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'CAPS1 sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website. We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch. We just have to raise them the best we can.",0
"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock their. First, the expectations of the project were unrealistic because there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" CAPS1 even if they found a safe way to land dirigibles they would be breaking the law. Second, there were ""violent air currents."" When they tried to dock the dirigible on the building, it could not get close enough to it to land because of the wind. Lastly, it was a huge safety hazard. Most dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is very Flammable. In a densely populated area. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [bad an] accident could have been. As a result, dirigibles never fulfilled the expectations of the transportation of the future and they did not dock on the Empire State Building.",0
"Pride, determination, relief  all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First the cyclist started of rideing on fresh legs and good directions, but after a while down the road he started to dought the old men, a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their been a sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it. After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode out of pride to get to his destination. Next the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things, I gathered  a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst. This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally the cyclist was fatigue when he arrived at the CAPS1 shop because he then knew the old men were right and would reach his destination, As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink this quote shows he was polite naturally to get water but to know the men were right.",0
"For some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. Patience is a big part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. Take this for example. I had woke up at six and jumped out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I pulled on my camofage and hunters orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. The moon light shone bright and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in its place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exiting time, and it was all because of patience. Patience MONTH1 not always help in ways you wish, but it can help you see many diffrent and beautiful things.",0

"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives a certain mood was created. The type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and CAPS1 mood. It was because of the different things that were happening in this community, and more importantly the house. This house had become a home to Narciso because of all the different that would happen there. like the Cuban music, the constant in and out of extended family members, and the fact that this all happened because his parents selflessly came to this country to give him a better life, even though they had to leave behind their families, careers, in the country they loved.

"The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in its non-natve land, Saeng will too.

"Do I think we should have to take books off of shelves? No  we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves. Think of it in your own perspective. For example, say you like horror books. If someone else doesn't like horror and you do, and they take it off of the shelves, how mad would you be.     I like CAPS1 magazines. Magazines like CAPS1 CAPS2, or ORGANIZATION1. If there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off. My perspective is that if you don't like what you see then put the book, magazine or whatever it might be up. Don't just sit there and complain, because how would you feel if the same thing happened to you?     I have had personal experience with these kinds of problems. At my school, we used to have magazines like ORGANIZATION1. Just non-hurtful things. All it took though was one person to complain about it, and boom! They were gone. CAPS1 fanatics like me don't like to see our favorite things gone. So really, what is the problem?     The problem is that people can't handle what they see. It is understandable to a certain point. Like if your a very religous person, then yes i understand that you couldn't look at those things. But when you do it just to spite someone, then that is very hurtful.     Finally, i just want to say that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself. Just because you don't like something, doesnt mean someone else won't. You wouldnt want it to happen to you",0

I strongly agree that computers have a positive effect on our society.

So please, local newspaper keep reading and I will change your mind about computers effects on people. Do you have family or friends who CAPS1't live around here that you want to keep in touch with? Using the computer for email or a chat site like facebook will do that. I have cousins who live in LOCATION2. The only way my family can keep in touch with them not spending money is email. My mom and her sister are sending emails to each other all the time. If you ask me I think that is a positive effect computers have. Have you ever researched anything using a computer? I knew I have! For a school project in CAPS2 I had to research about LOCATION1. I did all my research on the computer. I got an A+! I would not have gotten that grade if I did not use the computer to do research. Do you use a computer in your job? Well even if you CAPS1't I know a lot of people who do. For example, my dad uses a computer for almost the whole day he is at work. He is a CAPS3 CAPS4 which means he managed portfolios. He has to use ORGANIZATION1 to check on the stock chart. Another example is my mom, teacher, she has using the computer to email parents if the student need help or up. So as you can see computers have good effect on our society.

I hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. Say yes to computers good effect!",0
"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to snow sympathay for the hibiscus. Another reason would be showing that Saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her. Meaning that she doesnt want her mom to think that she is going to give up. This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. Lastly I think that this last paragraph snowed how Saeng wants people to know that even some as small and meaning less as a plant can help her overcome obsticles, and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that how we know that Saeng will not stop believing in herself.",0

"Laughter is the best way to show someone that they are funny. It is the best way to relax. Everyone says that hearing a baby laugh is great. Watching comedians doing their acts can cheer people up and have them start laughing. Laughter is the best way to relax and here is three reason for that. First, is that no one can stay angry at the person making them laugh. Second, is that when someone laughs everyone around that person start laughing. Third and last reason, is that no one can stay sadden when something funny is happening. What do you think when you hear a baby's laughter? I think that the baby is truly loved by its family. He or she is having a bast playing with someone in the family or themselves. They think that whatever you are doing is funny. A comedian's job is to make a crowd of people laugh at or with them. One way a comedian does an act is stand up comedy. That is when a comedian is on stage and does his or her act. Another way is a comedy. A comedy can be a CAPS1.V. show, a play, or a movie.

"When Al Smith first came up with the plan to use the Empire State Building is a mooring mast, he had no idea how obstacles they would face in a attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One large obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (CAPS1 NUM1) The reason this is so unsafe is because if the gas inside ever happened to catch on fire, the entire craft would exploded in flames. This is a hazard to those in the ship, as well as those in the streets below. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (CAPS1 NUM2) This was a problem because it would cause to the dirigible to move all over the place. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast, without changing the design, the dirigible would probable tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework,"" (CAPS1 NUM3). That is a ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it possible for the dirigible to dock. It is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face.",0
"In my opinion I think people are spending to much time on technology because their is many people I know who stay on technology and don't even do work. Also, spending to much time on the computers and others things then taking time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People who stay to close to there technology will be addicted to it and they will start to kill brain cells. Some times people get locked because to much information was given out or you did somthing that you were'nt suppose to do. Downloading certain things also bring harm to your computer like viruses that can crash downthe computer hard drive and system. There are many good and bad thing about being on a computer like the bad things stalkers, hackers, seizers, blindness. Then the good thing about being on a computer is it teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, even allow people to talk online with other like friends or family. In my life it helps a little because I play lots of army games so when I go out with my cousins and friends we go label tagging in a sports complex and I use the same tactics that i learn to beat the other teams. It hurts some people eye site when all their doing is stairring durectly at eh screen. one experience was like NUM1 months ago the last time I stayed at my aunts house all my cousins do was stay on th ga me till they have to take a bath, clean and eat, They didn't even go to sleep till eight in the TIME1. Some parents should at least give an hour a day to say he game. For me I only go on the computer for like twenty minutes then log and go back online later on in the day.",0
"The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life. I-I failed the test, Saeng had failed her drivers test and was very unhappy. She also disliked her new home. She was still too shaky to say at home she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up. After talking to her mother, it renewed her hopes so the author uses this paragraph to signify that she still have hope in the end and when she is ready she will try again. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.",0
"The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful andor thankfull mood. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their ""family"". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him.",0
I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness made up of many different moods. The other moods are reminisceance and hapiness. Thankfulness is focused on in paragraphs NUM1 and NUM2. Narciso Rodriguez talks about thankful he is his parents gave up so much to come to LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were. He showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like. Lastly happiness which is mostly his mood when he remineses his past and family. Those are the moods of his meimor.,0
The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story.,0
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there are no cars, building, water, or people in sight. It goes from flat road to rolling hills. Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedeling. Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free. So he pedeled up to the building, and that with all the others was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case. He is in the middle of nowhere. He finally came to bend and say Then, as easily as randing a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.",0
"The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story with winding roads and hills peddling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging, with the rider having little to know way or the roads were ten times harder to deal with. And with no landmarks or places insight its hard to have confidence because theire is nothing to keep going for.",0

I was just waiting for his to be done. Then his picture was done we looked at it and we all laughed. I was next I sat on the seat the sun was right on me. I got very hot and I did not just want to sit their but I was patient. I didnt say a word just sat their and smiled. A picture that took about NUM1 to draw felt like a half hour. Then I was done.

"Being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a DATE1 and my mom woked me up at NUM1 she say we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didnt know that I was going to have to be paitent the whole day. First on our way to the ORGANIZATION1 market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about NUM2 mins to an hour. When we finally made it to the ORGANIZATION1 market we had to stand in line for about NUM3 mins. I told my mum Im ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another NUM4 to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life.",0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, When they com back, Saeng vowed silently to hersef, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test again. I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her com fort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.",0
"My father is a stone cold mean man. About the only time he smiles is when hes has a beer or when hes with friends.

"Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce hisher speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water.",0
"do computers give a possitive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, although computers help with certain everyday life, I think that it gives one negative effects. I have many reasons for this belief, but the three most important are going to be stated. First of all, people are to busy on their computers that they spend less time. People are also in busy with there computers that they spend less and less time enjoying nature. Last but most importantly, people are so caught up with technology, they barely spend time with freinds and family. So, in my opinion, I think people should get technology, and the real world. Have you ever walked down the street and saw someone the size of a boulder? well it isn't a good sight is it? My point is, that can happen to you let me change that to everyone in the world. Nowadays, people are spending less and less time exercising, but instead sitting at home on the computer, or slouched on the couch with a laptop. People are ignoring their health and instead staying on the computer. I for one, know how hard it is to resist playing the computer, but you shouldn't let a tiny CAPS2 take over your mind and now your future. Nature. The most wonderful thing in the world I say the second most wonderful to technology. Have you ever turned on the t.v. and see nature its beauty? Well you can thank and global warming for that. When people use computers they burning fuel which harms our environment. People are technology they don't care about their and surroundings. If I was a I would say, ""CAPS3 less computers and CAPS3 more green!"" CAPS4..... it's luxury of having a family. Family and friends , it's most important thing. Sue to computers, many people are family and friends. For example: CAPS5: CAPS6 want to go ride bikes? John: CAPS7. I want to play my computer. Kids and adults was single-handed. In my opnion family most important, unlike a piece of metal that has a screen In conclusion, I think that computers of a regular effect on people, life you people by it. People are spending less time with their health and exercising advance in technology. They are all spending less time at the park big or simply just enjoying nature's beauty. Most importantly, there is less interacting with friends and family. But, this is just my opinion, it won't mean anything if you don't agree. I consideration.",0
The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didnt have much water. In the text it says I was traveling the high desserts of California in June. The deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasnt able to drink much because he had limited water.,0
"If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be offensive to anybody don't even bother to look at the material.  Even if you might find it interesting, in then end you find out that it is offensive to you then just take it the other direction.  No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the materials because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation. Nobody has the same views as everybody else, each person is different in their own way.  Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional?     Each individual has their own opinion of each material. It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person it might not even effect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard. Others MONTH1 have to realize that even if its written down it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have tooken it the wrong way. Even if your just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you. Don't let anybody tell you different of your own opinion.     The cenorship in libraries are not made just for you, they are made for everbody around you. If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inapropriate then just walk away and put it down. Anything in the library shouldn't be removed, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will find it interesting. If you find any material offensive then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong.  You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it.      I go to the library once in a while,and most of the time i'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up. Once I start reading it, and if I feel  the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive I just leave it along and put it down.  I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book. So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me?  I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that someone else's opinion and not my own.      If anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic. Anybody should know that your own opinion matters than anything else or anybody else. The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter. It doesn't change how you feel about the topic. The way you feel about it should not affect the way other people feel see it",0

"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.The first problem, presented in paragraph nine, was that they hadn't originally designed the building to hold a one thousand foot dirigible with a single rope."" A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building.... Would add stress to the buildings frame."" CAPS1 had to reinforce the building to handle this new stress.The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was that the dirigibles are made out of a dangerous element, ""Hydrogen is very flammable."" The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area.In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & led, they could no longer do because of the location that they desire to dock it. The builders of the empire state building atempted to fight architectural flaws, dirigibles safety flaws, and the flaws of nature allow dirigibles to dock there which ultimately didn't work out.",0
"but not everyone does that, The computer is a good resource to invest time in. The effects computers have on people is good (for the most part).

When people use a computer they can get information which for research and work (word) That's because, when your on a computer you can simply relax but get available amount of work done.

"In the memoir, the author emphasized a very specific mood. She greatly emphasized warmth and safety. By warmth, she meant that you were always surrounded by loved ones. It meant something you'll always remember, because it's such a remarkable feeling. By stressing this warmth, it meant that it created memories. The other part of this mood was safety. The explanation of the safety was that you're surrounded by people that care about you, and there's no one to judge you, no one to hurt you, and you're safe from any dangers. I personally love the mood of this story because it's something I long for each DATE1 down thecape. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is very clear.",0
"The author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their determination. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. When she sees the Hibiscus, she is filled with memories of the past and weeps.

The mood by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is happy. When the author talk about his or her memoirs it seemed like they felt happy having those memoirs to talk about. Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you. That is what I think the author's mood is.,0

I think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a   room just for grown ups. In the dunkirk library there is a room that has just adult books and the kids cannot go in there with out a parent. So whenever you go in there your parent are with you. But i dont think you can check them out. But if i had a kid i would not want them to see that kind of stuff until they got older so i think there should be seperate rooms. So whenever they got older and maturd they could go in there and see the books and maybe one day check them out and read one of them.      But on the other hand why not leave them on the shelf for kids to see because if not there gonna see iot other places or from other people then they go home asking there mom what this means and stuff why not let them learn on ther own from a book. There are some people that woulf agree with that but then there are people that would disagree with that. So maybe there should be rooms for different books and you can go in them whenever you want or maybe there should be rules that you cant go in there with out a parent.          I don't no what to do maybe there should be a vote between people if they like it or not. But some people would be mad over that so if you chose one someone would not like it or aomething like that.My upion is to just keep the books there and let the kids find out on there own.Some people would think im a bad parent but would you want you child to find out somwhere else.,0
"I think that the author concludes the story she fails the driving test, so they added she was going to take it over. And maybe the plant is or would be good luck to her after the snow melts and the geese return it would be a fresh Start. Also it would be nice after she descovered the plant.",0

"ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room?

But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games.

There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment.

"Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. PERSON1, the head surgean at ORGANIZATION2 says, ""CAPS3 technology, our ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything."" CAPS4 PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before.

Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped.

Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living.",0
"It was midsummer, and i could feel the cool ocean breeze washing over my skin. You would think everything would be calm, but it was the exact oppasite.I wouldnt talk to him or even look at him. He was trying so hard to get me to laugh but i just couldnt. I was so furious with him that i thought nothing between us would ever bee the same again. I thought that our three months together was up, and it scared me so much. He left for his trip the next day, and he left without saying a word.       I cried myself to sleep for a week. I knew he was back in town already, but he hadent called or said anything to me. After weeks of wondering and waiting, i could feel th at it was over. I talked to my sister and she told me that he would come around again and i had to be patient. I tried to take her words in my heart and i wanted to believe that it was true. I called his house everynight, but everynight i got the same answer, ""he's not home, but i'll let him know you called"". i wanted to believe that i would hear from him, so to pass the time i kept my self busy with cleaning and going out with my family. A couple of day's of not thinking and worrying about him did me good. I was smiling and laughing again. I felt like i could begin to breath a little and have fun. My sister's advice ended up working cos a week later he called me and told me that he wanted to see me. I told him he could come by DATE1 and that i was very excited to see him again. The call ended and i was smiling from ear to ear.            The next couple of day's i was in a complete fenzy, getting everything clean, figuring out what i was going to wear. Everyone thought i was going crazy, but the truth is that i was scared. Scared of what he will say to me, and were we would go from here. Th days seemed to fly by and the next thing i knew, he was knocking on my door. I let him in and he took my by surprise with a big hug. We sepnt hours jsut talking and listening to music. It was as if nothing had ever changed. Before we knew it it was dark out and he was leaving. I walked him to the front of my trailer park, and he sat me down on the side walk and took my hand's. I was shocked and didnt know what to do but listen. He told me that he was sorry for the way he acted and that tonight he realized how much he wanted to be with me, and that he was completely in love with me. I couldnt do anything except cry and laugh at the same time, and soon enough he was laughing with me. I couldnt have asked for a more perfect moment.      It's been six months since TIME1. We are better than ever becuase we have the laughter. It's what help's keep our relationship solid, and it keep's us close. Everyone need's a little laughter in there life.

"After reading the quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test.

Reflecting back I feel Saeng felt that the geese was secretly letting her know what she was doing was right.",0
"When the cyclist is at his low point, he is an abandoned ghost town, looking for water that tastes like battery acid. The cyclist feels hopeless in the abandoned town. When he first reaches the water pump and the abandoned juice building he has a little hope only to be let down, because the building has no juice and the water pumps water is too hot and the water is not any good. The setting is the reason his mood changes through out the story.",0
"CAPS1! Get off that computer it is TIME1. But mom I dont want to im in the middle of a game. Does that conbersation sound familiar? Of course it does. Every kid likes to play on the computer. However, noticing your kid being on the computer NUM1 is not a good thing. In this matter experts are definatley PERCENT1 right because kids and adults are spending too much time on the computer. These people can do other things like excersising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer is not healthy. On the other hand, if someone kicks you of the computer you can always get that six pack you wanted. There are three main things that can get you in shape. First, taking a light run every night on your community track can get your legs from being fatigued every time you walk up the stairs to having your legs be firm and able to run lap after lap just for a warm up. Every years my dad takes me to the track in DATE1 and times me for NUM2 and NUM3 yard dash, the NUM4 meter, and the mile. Between the months I train all the way up to DATE2 then my dad does another assment. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another way to get in shape. Some basic excersises are bench pressing, squating, and dumbell curles. There are more challenging excersise but I won't go into that. Once you feel like your in shape, take all of that trainign and put it into a sport. Excersising is not the only thing you can do. Enjoying nature is another option. Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absoarb everything about the nature. From the squirrls to the tress. If you are in the winter enjoy the snow instedid of being inside NUM1 playing computer games. But, if that doesn't work out for you then hangout with your family. Hanging out with your family can be thing you can do. Gather your family and plan a trip. You can go to a baseball game, park, or movies anything that will get you away from that computer. That is my opinion why I think people should get excersise, enjoy nature, and spend time with their families insted of being on the computer NUM1.",0
"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building.A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework.The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for diringibles to land there. The diringibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibitting the aircraft flying so low.",0
"The builders faced many obstacles when trying to build the empire state building. First of all for it to be a NUM1 ft building it would have to have a very strong base to support it and they had to reinforce the base too to be able to mount the mooring mast on top. They also faced issues with the strong air currents that flowed above New York. None of the dirigibles were able to dock because of the high current. The mooring mast also placed stress on the frame. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" this proves proves how much difficulty the builders were going to have with the construction of the Empire state building.",0
"In the article Do not exceed the posted speed limit, the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off the whole Setting was a dry, dusty not desert that would chair anybody. The sun was beginning to beat down, but i borely noticed it. The own affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which bring me to the next point. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in June. This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory. This affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. In the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water.",0
"The censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already.  A few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is.  Those reason are That the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read.     The first reason is that parents shoud be in charge of what their children read.  If the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it.  If the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area.  Although, sometimes the child MONTH1 stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice.  That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read.     The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship.  Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious book (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely innapropriate.  Some people would say that books like CAPS1 mythology books are innapropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever.  Most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read, so they would not even look at them.  Few people would agree on censorships, and a lot of people would disagree.     The third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the innapropriate books.  The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others.  It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say 'CAPS2 I want to read that one.' the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort.  The point being that a person can read other books than just innapropriate books.     Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. The censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree.  The children probably would not look at the innapropriate book anyways, because they would not interest the child.",0
Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.,0
"Should we take off books that are offensive? I think that we should not take them out if they are offensive. If we do take off the offensive stuff off the self then there are not any more on the self. If all of us could take off the book, movie, or music that in fensive to us then there will be no books, movies, or music on the self.     First off all, there will be no war books, movies, or music on the self. All the hippys will take the war stuff off because they dont like war. They will say that it infensive on them on take them off. I think that we should read about war and witch them because it is a good way to learn our mistake. If we don't learn the mistake of war we will lose and we wont learn how we loss and we will go into war over and over again we will win some and lose alot because we wont learn how we lost.     Secondly, all the music that are good and bad will be taken off the self. All the mothers that are to protactive they will take them done. It have bad language in it and a bad theme to it. If they take them down how can the football players, solders, and fighters can be ready for the fight if they don't have the songs that they like to listen to and get pump for the fight.     Finally, they will take out all thethe books of star wars and forgetten ralms. Some people don't like them because they think that it wont come true and they will take them out and say that it infensives them on there thinking wise. Star wars is a good book and movie and forgetten ralms is a good book maker company.     All of this is why i don't want this to happen. All the good music, books, and movies well go away and the people who like them well get mad.",0
"One day not CAPS1 very long ago, my brother PERSON1, had homework troubles. And yes CAPS2 is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night. Mostly math. One day he needed help. I had said on what. CAPS1 he said CAPS2 math homework its just too long and I cant do it. CAPS3, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney I need help. CAPS1 I helped him. It took alot of patience, and I was very patient, for him taking an hour long. I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. While I patiently wait for him to get out of the shower, I get a separate piece of paper copied down the problems, answered them, and got them right. When PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills I helped him. At student led confereces I seen he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper.",0

"During the DATE1 of the sixth grade CAPS4 parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at CAPS4 best friend PERSON1's house.   ""CAPS1, CAPS2 CAPS3 father"" CAPS4 CAPS5 said through the phone to me.   ""CAPS6 CAPS5, CAPS8's CAPS9?"" I asked him.   ""CAPS10 need to come home, CAPS10 CAPS18 has served me today with divorce papers."" CAPS12 told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell CAPS9 in CAPS4 eyes. I had no clue CAPS8 was happening, I was only NUM1 and vaguely knew CAPS8 divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung CAPS9 the phone and ran into PERSON1's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to CAPS8 extent.   I stayed at LOCATION1's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see CAPS4 CAPS18 or CAPS4 father. At night I drempt about CAPS8 CAPS4 sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered CAPS8 CAPS4 father was doing, where CAPS4 CAPS18 was, and whether or not CAPS4 sisters were CAPS13. Even though I knew I should have gone home at one point during those two weeks, I didn't.  During those two weeks at LOCATION1's house, I felt safe and secure, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion that I had longed for, but all the times that I tried to smile, tried to laugh, tried to be myself, I couldn't. I knew that something had changed in me when I hung CAPS9 the phone on CAPS4 father. I had never hung CAPS9 on anyone before. It was something that I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset, I did it anyways.  When CAPS4 CAPS18 came to pick me CAPS9 after CAPS4 two week extended stay at LOCATION1's, she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in CAPS4 CAPS18 before. She usually was so calm and in control. I had never seen her so concerned or upset. I knew that she was concerned for me. I also knew that PERSON1's CAPS14 had called mine several times during CAPS4 stay. I assume she told her about how I was acting, but CAPS8 was I supposed to do? CAPS4 parents were splitting CAPS9! CAPS4 whole life was being flushed down the toilet. I knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside.  No one spoke on the ride home. I could feel the tension building as we turned onto CAPS4 street and drove towards CAPS4 house. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran to CAPS4 room, leaving CAPS4 things on the back seat of the sedan. For two days, I didn't eat or sleep. I just laid in CAPS4 bed longing for CAPS4 father to come home. I had never gone to bed without CAPS4 father tucking me in, never woke CAPS9 in the TIME1 on CAPS4 own. There were so many things that CAPS4 father did that CAPS12 wasn't there to do anymore.  Things didn't start to get better until CAPS4 CAPS18 sent me and CAPS4 sisters to CAPS4 CAPS15 house in LOCATION2. I don't know why, but when I was there, I felt that same sense of safeness and security that I felt when I was at LOCATION1's house. Even though I felt safe and secure, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I had visited PERSON1, and I was dying to go back to her house. I knew that that was the only place that I could actually recover from CAPS8 was happening. CAPS4 CAPS15 house was nice and all, but it didn't feel like home, I didn't think that anywhere I stayed would feel right. All I knew is that I needed CAPS4 CAPS5, not CAPS4 CAPS17 or CAPS4 CAPS18, just CAPS4 CAPS5, and maybe PERSON1.  When I came home from CAPS4 CAPS15 house, I made arrangements to go over to LOCATION1 house. I knew that I would be staying awhile, so I packed extra. When I got there, I told her about CAPS8 was going on and how CAPS4 sisters were doing. On the night that I arrived, we decided that we would go to the river the next day. I thought it was an alright idea. The next day we went to the river, her brothers decided to join us. Her brother PERSON2 wanted to prove to us how much of a man CAPS12 was, so CAPS12 jumped off of the largest rock at the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannon ball, but it wasn't. CAPS12 landed on his stomach for the perfect belly flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think i stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I had since the day CAPS4 father called me at LOCATION1's house.",0
"The mood created by the author is warmth. First off, in paragraph two, it says how his family would always cook food and turn on the cuban music. It also says how the smell of the food would fill the house. In paragraph four, it says how they would always have family members over for dinner. Some of the family members they would have were Grandparents, Aunts, CAPS1, and cousins. The last reason the mood is warmth is because he said in paragraph seven, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that before they lived there, it was just three rooms; however, once they moved in, they turned it into a place where friends and family could gather and have fun.",0
"The memoir's mood is a sense of happiness because its talking about a place where neighbors are like family and everyone is very close. Like how Sergio and PERSON1 became his surrogate grandparents, when they were people who lived in the basement appartment. Alegria, his first friend normally ate dinner with them. The whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors.",0
"Based on the excerpt some obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the laws CAPS1 plane height, the fact that some dirigibles used hydrogen fuel instead of helium, and lastly at such great heights the strong wind currents were a problem as well. The restriction of plane height was that plaes could not fly to low above cities without being a safety hazard. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". (The MOORING MAST). Another obstacle related to the fact that some outside the U.S dirigibles used hydrogen fuel in place of helium which could cause a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable. ""From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"". (The Mooring Mast). Lastly, strong winds were an obstacle as well, the high wind currents would blow the dirigibles all around as the attempted to dock at the Empire State Building which would pose as a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". (The Mooring Mast). In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",0

One time my CAPS3 planned a fishing trip to LOCATION1. CAPS8 CAPS1t know. He told me to pack my suit case for three days worth of clothes I said why he said we are going to LOCATION1 tomorrow with your causins PERSON1 and ryan. I was so excited that I flew to my room and pounded cloths in my CAPS2 and looked through everything I would need. I asked my CAPS3 what we were doing there he said were going on a fishing trip in the CAPS4 river for pike. The CAPS5 CAPS6 I got a new cherrywood fishing pole and a really nice underspin real. So I got my fishing poles ready packed my CAPS7 and went to sleep so I could get up early. NUM1 am come and my alarm went off I was so tierd I could barely see CAPS8 we had to be at my uncles house at NUM2 so I had to get ready. Once we got to my uncles house we met them then we all left. I wanted to sleep in the car CAPS8 I couldnt once we got in LOCATION1 it was so cool with the huge cliffs and hills we even sas a bear CAPS10 a river that we stopped at then we went up river and there was a clear mud hole withe millions of frog in it. When we finally got there my CAPS3 made me wait and unpack. Once me and my causin got CAPS12 unpacking we went right to the store to fish my first cast I caught a little NUM3 incher on a ORGANIZATION1. After that we caught nothing so we came back up when it got CAPS13 and roasted hotdogs over the fire. The next morning we got up early and only fished on the lake CAPS10 the LOCATION3 we caught nothing. That night we went fishing on the CAPS4 river and we still caught nothing. The guy that owned the cabin said we should cath NUM4 or NUM5 pike a CAPS5 CAPS8 it had rained seven feet so they wernt feeding. The next CAPS5 we got up early again and fished all CAPS5. In the morning I had one hit we had nothing afterward. At lunch we found a little LOCATION2 to eat lunch on it had a actual rock cave and we had scared a bear off the LOCATION2. Later we went to this little canyon that was really hard to clime I almost fell halfway CAPS19 CAPS8 I got looked on a root. We saw another bear eating berries that we video taped and we killed a chipmunk with a CAPS21 rock that we threw CAPS19. Wham it almost took my pole I fought it for about ten minutes I waited and waited it was a digantic pike CAPS8 it shapped my line and I still have never seen that pike.,0
"When building the dock for dirigibles. Al Smith was only able to think of a few obstacles that would come up. As it turns out, there were more obstecles than expected. One that was expected was the building could be pulled over by the dirigibles as stated in paragraph NUM1, third sentence. An obstacle that was unknown until after the mast was built was the violen shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast and to dang weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered unsafe as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to the fourth. Another untold issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph NUM2, first sentence) along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph NUM3, second sentence). The whole idea of a docking mast was not well thought out.",0

"The byciclist from Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit was effected in many ways from the environment. The most talked about feature in the environment was the lack of water. The byciclist was going to die because there was no water and he was really dehydrated. Another feature was the heat. It was really hotwhere the narrator was bycicling. When CAPS1 hot, the heat dehydrates you. So the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was hauntinghim until he got mad at the lodgers hetalked to and was really frustrated.

"Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast goes the wind, pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation.

They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly NUM1 feet below.",0

"In my way of viewing things i say that what i think is that the book, movies, music, and magazines should be put in critical order because some of us want or like to read or see stuff about what we want to see like the news that are in one way good to us, but some others like to see what's behind from the reality and want to speak up but they can because they are afraid that they would get hurt for speaking up. So i think that those things(books, music, movies, magazines) should not be removed from the shelfs because those books or movies can bring you what's going on in the world and how is affecting us in the way of not paying attention to it. Some experiences that i have is music i had once heard a song in spanish called 'CAPS1 The CAPS2' and it talks about the corruption in LOCATION1 and that how the people from the bottom suffer because of the people from the top do not care about them, also if you treat them as kings they will treat you as a slaves, and that if you give them the CAPS2 to control you, they will take out advantage of it, how the honest people work hard to bring food to their homes, but its not enough because of the leaders on top that want all for them... its a very good song that says the true about it and that nobody does something to finished.So i don't want that songs or books that show the reality disapper because some people doesn't like them at all",0
"Many believe that laughter is the key to the start of a great friendship. CAPS1 can mend the broken bridges between people and even make awesome relationships even better. Laughter can be such a powerful thing and most don't understand CAPS7 powerful. I especially didn't know until two years ago when I met PERSON1. CAPS1 only took the move of my former CAPS3 CAPS2 to understand laughter's full potential of the beginning of a great friendship CAPS1 all started a couple weeks before school ended when the news was received. At the time i was part of a small CAPS3 group, in a small church, in a small town. CAPS3 CAPS2, PERSON2 and PERSON3 were moving, and would no longer be able to lead the CAPS3 group. The entire church congregation was saddened by the sudden news. But none were as depressed as the CAPS3 that they had touched in their many years in ministry. We had grown used to the couple. Many of the few that had been around the longest , including myself, had spent nights at their house, or in my case babysat their young daughter. They were like family to all of us and no one wanted to see them go. But sometimes I wonder if they hadn't what would have happened. Many well wishes and tears were exchanged between the day they had departed. As a congregation everyone thought that no one could ever touch our hearts they way that they had. But that was just a thought. Two short months later, word had gotten around that someone from LOCATION1 was traveling here to our small town in LOCATION2 for an interview for the newly open position. All the teenagers were guarded the moment that he had walked through the door. His name was PERSON1, only in his early twenties, but had quite a lot of experience in ministry. My first thought was that this must be some kind of joke! CAPS7 could he lead a group of kids if he's only a kid himself!? I wasn't very keen of him. Neither was anybody else. But something was very different about him. He wasn't afraid to tell us about his life, CAPS7 he had grown up, and seemed to be totally honest with everyone of our questions we asked. And that was when we knew as a CAPS3 group that maybe he was the one.  Even though I knew PERSON1 would be our new CAPS3 CAPS4 I still didn't want to accept CAPS1. I tried and tried to avoid him although CAPS1 always seemed we were having to deal with each other more than either of us wanted to. So finally, PERSON1 decided CAPS1 was time that the two of us needed to get to know each other. One DATE1 TIME1 my mom got a call from someone at the church, she wouldn't tell me who, but that I needed to go. So I did. And who was there? PERSON1, in the sanctuary just the two of us and the associate CAPS4, because CAPS1 would be too inappropriate for us to be by ourselves. "" your mom didn't tell you CAPS6 your here, did she?""I laughed, "" CAPS6 no she didn't"" "" CAPS7 do you feel you and I talk? Go hang out, wherever you want?""""um....ok CAPS7 do you feel about going to ORGANIZATION1?"" The question was puzzling to him, CAPS1 did to most, but he accepted the idea. ""CAPS8 CAPS6 are we going to ORGANIZATION1?"" he said as he pulled into the parking lot."" I don't know CAPS1 was just the first thing that popped into my head.""We both chuckled. I felt more at ease with him now and actually thought for the first time that maybe this would be a pretty fun trip.  As we walked through the building CAPS1 started to be quite boring. But the boredom faded away as we decided to pass through the toy aisle, and set off all of the toy alarms and sirens. Toy after toy had started to go off as we went through the aisle touching every toy that made some kind of absurd noise that would drive anyone up the wall, which many did. Finally we walked around the store to other departments in the store and got to know each other a little better. CAPS1 surprised me that both of us liked a lot of the same things. He told me more of his childhood like CAPS7 he was adopted and what CAPS1 was like before hand and afterwards. CAPS1 was wierd that only a short time ago I didn't want anything to do with PERSON1 and now I was walking around ORGANIZATION1 laughing and just having a good time. That was about three years or so ago. Shortly after PERSON1 had to leave. Many rumors were told CAPS6 because he didn't really tell anyone other than the fact that the council had asked him to leave. No matter the reason I still am in touch with him and am glad that the day at ORGANIZATION1 had happended.",0

"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the author, ""... was destined to never fulfill its purpose [Empire State building being a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively.",0
"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is a nonstalgic mood is created from his memories. The mood is created by his parents and where he lives. One way the mood is nonstalgic is he's grateful towards his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (CAPS1 NUM1). By being grateful towards his parents, he is helping the nonstalgic mood grow. Also, where he live helps the mood. ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home those"" (CAPS1 NUM2).

"In The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State building faced Problems trying to dock the dirigibles. One big obstacle is that the dirigibles were a safety hazard. For example ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible had caught on fire while docked in such a highly populated area many people could have been killed. Another issue was nature, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around, making it unsafe. The builders faced many obstacles and unfortunately could never dock a dirigible at the Empire State building",0
"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time. This paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers. The text say, when they come back... I will take that test again. This quote shows that Saeng can see herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She knows that her winter is her test and that when she is ready, shell be able to take the test again and be successful. The budding of the hibiscus represents the time when shell be prepared to take the test. Though she is having a tough tine now, she'll be able to get through it and make another attempt. This paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus. Without saying this, the readers would have never gotten this message, instead, they would believe that the role of the hibiscus was to serve as a connection to Saengs past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to show readers that everyone can balance back from a bad situation.",0
"Can you imagine life without laughter? Life without laughter is plain, dull, and boring. Laughter is an important part in life. There would be nothing to look forward to if laughing didn't exist. Laughter creates memories, relationships, and it fills in the awkward silence between two people.   Some people don't realize how important laughing is. Life without laughter is like life without water. I think that's how important laughter really is. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is true, but laughing is more then just an element. It's way more important than that. Well I guess we could all live without laughter, but who would want to?  No laughter means no fun times like: swimming, water parks, ice skating, dancing, etc. Those fun things can lead to laughing. Without anything fun to do no one would look forward to tomorrow. Everyday would be a waste, if there wasn't any laughter in the world.   Some people might just think that laughing is just an element. Why is that? Laughter is important enough to be more than that. For example water is an element because it has something to do with the earth. It stands for the ocean. Laughter doesn't fit in that category. Laughing has such a huge impact on our lives. Laughing makes everything tens time better. Laughing creates memories, memories creates relationship. That's why laughter is an important part in any relationship. It's amazing how the smallest thing can make such a big difference in our lives.",0
"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in trying to dock dirigibles there, but they had to figure a way around. The architects believed that the mooring mast would work and they started building. Soon enough, problems evolved that could not be fixed. An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. After all these problems, the architects never added the landing gear to the mooring mast because they knew that it would not be used as it was intended to.",0

"One of the obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was to strengthen the frame of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph NUM1)."" If the building was not strengthen, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying it's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts in danger the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature is another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the Building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on Top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is no where close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and blow onto a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles faced in docking a dirigible successfully.",0

"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included issues in safety, nature problems, and a dilemma with a law. Safety was a major concern as many dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. An example of such a dirigible was the German Hindenburg, which went up in flames in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York City."" CAPS1, nature was a big obstacle the owners faced, as the winds on top of the building constantly shifted. According to Lüsted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" which would not have been ""practical nor safe."" CAPS2, there were legal issues the builders faced. There was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas.

"Computers are helpful in everyone's life. New things can be learned from them. They can provide a way to contact others. And they make writing a lot easier. Overall, they have a good effect on the world. Technology lets everyone explore new topics. If something is typed into ORGANIZATION1, results will pop up within seconds. Click on these, and information that is needed is displayed. The computer is also helpful for research papers. The internet allows a more elaborate final draft. Learning benefits a grade in school or in work. It is always good to be able to contact anyone who is wanted. With the computer, people are abel to CAPS1, talk on CAPS2, or even talk to a loved one on a webcam. On CAPS2, pictures be added so anyone who wasn't able to be at an event can now see what is was like.

"Many people have different views on different types of things. There is not much that can be helped with that. No one can never make everybody happy. That is a major part of life. I do not think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive. You cannot make everyone happy, some people enjoy those materials, and everyone is entitiled to their own opinion.     The first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that. Just because some people take offense to certain things, does not mean that everyone does. If they do not like it, they do not have to read it or listen to it. They have libraries so you can pick out books (and other materials) that you like. You have a choice there. There are lots of books that are at libraries around the world. People are going to be mad whether they are there or not. Have you ever heard the saying 'CAPS1't judge a book by its cover?' CAPS2, well that could also be a reason people want materials removed. They might see a 'suggestive' cover or something, and they might take total offense to that. Just because a cover of a book might make people take offense to it doesn't mean they should remove it.      The second reason offensive materials should not be removed is because it is enjoyable for some people. There is a reason it is in the library, and that reason is because some people enjoy it. If there was a book or magazine that never got checked out, do you think they would keep it? Nope. I am pretty sure if it never got checked out, they would get rid of it. Obviously someone has to read, listen, or watch it. People get offended by things everyday. Removing 'offensive' materials from libraries will not be much help to the problem. It MONTH1 help a little, but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily.      The third reason they should keep materials is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do. For some people, taking away things like that would be like making kids at school wear uniforms. It takes away freedom. We are living in LOCATION1. LOCATION1 is supposed to be a free country. It is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people. I got news for you. If you CAPS1't like it, CAPS1't read it. There is no harm at all by keeping materials on shelves.      No matter what, someone is always going to take offense to something. The world is not perfect, and it is never going to be perfect. Taking materials off the shelves because it is offensive to some people isn't going to make the world a better place. People are going to be mad or angry no matter what happens",0
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, saeng was talking about how she failed the test, in which she wanted to retake. So, saeng declared that next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding , she shall take the test again.",0
"To begin with, a woman might read a book about wifes and find it offense. But it was her choice to pick up the book and read it. Should it be taken off the shelf? No why should it. Different people have different perpectives on what they're reading. Not all people feel the same way. Samething goes for music, movies, magazines, etc. They might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it. It was there choice to pick it up and read it. No one held a gun to there head and said 'read the book etc.'      CAPS1, why should a book, etc., be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it? You still have the rest of the population who might love it, some might just like it, and the ones who don't. You can't just think about that one person you have to consider everybody esle. If that person finds that book, etc., offensive then they should have chosen wisely the first time andor never should have chose what they did. It's there own fault.     For my conclusion, nothing should be taken off  the shelf if its offensive just don't read the book and etc. Another person might read it and like it. Some people who finds things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way. Keep the book etc., on the shelf if they take it off then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive. Then what we will be able to read or listen too",0

"Libraries.     What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of the things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them.      The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for CAPS1-rated thing. Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects.     When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some CAPS1-rated thing. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library.     What can be done about this problem? Even though it MONTH1 cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do. If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they MONTH1 think that it is ok to do. Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide. So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do.     Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers.",0
"CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computer including me. The computor in my opinion has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these ""exports"" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you cant find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isnt doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost realtive you havent spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Im not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to. Lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go. If this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one.",0
"In society today, people take things in very many different ways. So things that might help one person, MONTH1 offend other.      In libraries, there are different kinds of books; fiction, non fiction..(etc). So if you dont like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area. I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offened a few people.      We are blessed to live in LOCATION1, where we have freedom of speech. So authors have freedom to write what they would like to. They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf becasue it offened a few people? I do not think that is right.     'CAPS1 man's junk is another man's treasure.' I think this quote goes along with this topic very well, because the book MONTH1 not mean something to one person but it MONTH1 mean the word to someone else.      You never know what people MONTH1 need to hear. Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in hisher life and is ready to change, and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic. Now, this kind of book MONTH1 offend a few people, but it MONTH1 save a family, a friendship or maybe even a life.      Take CAPS2 CAPS3 for intance, her journal is now a book. Now this MONTH1 offend a few people that might have been thereor maybe don't like CAPS4 CAPS5, but her story has the right to be told. Yes, there is violence in it, and i understand that maybe you don't want your NUM1 year old to hear about how they use to treat CAPS4 CAPS7 women, but the story has the right to be told, and should be told.      I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library, just because it has offened a few. There are lots of different kinds of books, if the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book",0
"Builders of the Empire State Building faceD many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When designing the mast, they didn't realize that the mast ""would add stress to the building's frame"" and in order to fix this problem, they would have to pay ""over sixty thousand Dollars' worth"" for modifications for the building's framework.      Another problem they encountereD, besides the fact that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This did not allow dirigibles to be able to get close enough to dock, in fear that the ""wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" which would damage the dirigible's shell.      An alternate problems faceD by builders was realized when the Hindenburg was destroyeD in New Jersey, due to the fact that ""hydrogen is extremely flammable.""

"In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?",0
"I am a student from CAPS1. I wanted to let you know  that there have been some great and interesting books that I have read from the schools library and the public library as well. The only problem is that there have been some complaints from my friends and families about the books. Not only that but I've also seen books that are not appropriate for children to be reading. I just wanted to let you know this because I was kind of thinking that taking books out wouldn't be a good idea for them to do. I think so because without books less people would want to read and not learn.      To begin with, I wanted to talk about the complaints that friends have told me. One of them was that at the school there had not been good books to read and that they want to take most of them out and replace them with the ones they like. I was thinking that if they did that they would be the only ones to go to the library because it is only there choice and not everyones. So what I'm trying to say is that if we don't have good books students won't be going to the library. If they don't get books then they won't do well in school which is something that will affect the school.     Furthermore about the complaints was that one of my own family member had seen  a young girl looking at a book that was not appropriate for her at the public library. So instead of taking those types of books out they should be put into a room that is strictly not for children to go in. They should do that because if it were to be taken out then that book wouldn't ever be used again. Also another reason is that If they were to be taken out, then another peson might need information over the topic of the book and wouldn't be able to find it because it isn't there. That is why I thing those types of books should be in a special room intead of them being taken out.     Finally, as I had somewhat mentioned earlier is that books are truly important. That is why I go against taking books out that are not favored by others. If a person doesn't like a certain book magazine  then they should just request the book magazie that they want to read. By doing that then the book that arn't being used could actually be used by someone else that is intersted in it. So if we keep all our book, then more students and people would go and read.      In conclusion, people might say that taking out book is better than keeping them. Well in the way I see it, they are wrong because keeping them is better. It is better because  someday those books can be useful nomatter how old they are. If they were inappropriate books like metioned earlier, they should be put away in a good place. If there arn't enough interesing ones then requesting one is another way to do it. That is why I think that taking out books from the shelves is wrong and they should do watever in order to not let books go to waist",0
"No, cause if that is the case evry  book you read could be offense to somebody. If they think the book is bad then don't read it.First off a book should not be banned from a libary.It is just a book.Second the only reason they would want to band a book is because people like to start drama. Third reason every could be offense to somebody.          First off they should not band a book just because people don't like it.If your child read an adult book that is good for them, for reading those big words.And if they just happen to see a naked picture it is not the end of the world. I bet it is not the first and it won't be the last.     Second some people would try to band a book just to start drama. They know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author.     Finaly If they band books for being offense then they would not have a libary. Cause any body says something is offense.In all they should not band one book.",0

"There were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. One obstacle they faced is the safety of the passengers when the dirigibles would dock and the frame work of the building wouldn't collapse. I know this because in between paragraph NUM1 and NUM2 the excerpt says, ""'One set of egineers are here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.'"" The mast weighs alot so they're afraid it will put too much pressure on the empire state building. The egineers were also afraid of the dirigibles blowing up because the dirigibles use hydrogen. Hydrogen is way more flammable than helium. I know this because in between paragraph NUM3 and NUM4 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. These were a few of many obstacles the workers faced",0
"Libraries have so many books, and books that talk about everything so what would be the point of having a book taken off the shelves. If people want to read something that is to bad I say let thim what is so rong with reading everyone needs to read maybe thats the only books some people like to read. So by taking thim books off isn't helpping anything. I think some of the bad books taken off the shelves are good just have bad things in thim, any book is a good book. If something is so bad it needs off the shelves there has to be a reason for it, the way I see it is that there as to be a really good part in that book that just loves to make people mad and you know what that is funny. People get mad at books that they dont want there kids to read, or there mad because that didnt come up with that idea. If you dont want ur kids to read it tell thim not to let the older people that dont care have a good time reading. Most people like to read about mested up things.           Music and Movies are a different story. Bad movies shouldent be put out for everyone to see movies arnt the same as books because a kid could get a bad book and not now have of the bad stuff means. But movies show you how bad things are shown. Music can also teach you how to do bad things by doing the same thing they did to make thim look cool. But I still think you should be able to have what you want to pick and if you have kids you are a boss to thim you can tell thim not to get anything bad",0

"The library has many books, they would have anything that you could possibly imagine.The library is a great resource for any information. They have so much information that if you were to go to the library, you would be there all day. Libraries carry many different kinds of books. They would probably even carry a book perhaps on hats. There are libraries all around us and are very convienent.     If a library carried misleading books, music, movies, or even magazines, I would have to say that they could get in a lot of trouble, especially if a magazine or a movie or any other source of information, would show anything that would affend someone in any way, then someone should tell the librarian or the manager and say this should not be on the shelf. When people go to the library they are exspecting clean reviews about the library.             If a library were ment to carry offensive products it would not be called the library. The library is ment to be a quiet place where someone could go there and browse around maybe, or just go in and get what they need and come right on out . Most libraries are pretty peticular of what they should or should not put out on there shelves. If someone put something way out of the ordinary, and that person knows that they should not put the book on the shelf they should automatically be fired.       In conclusion libraries are very nifty and important to the town or city. The only thing would be is to keep an eye out for any offensive books, music, and etc. You never know when they will be randomly out on the shelf, and if you happen to find one you should imediently tell the librarian or the libraries manager.

"I as a student, a child and a citizen of of the united states believes that every book, should be allowed in any library.  Books, express feelings, emotions ect., the same thing with movies, music.  I we don't have them how will we be able to learn anything in this world. Each book out there has an explanation, a title and a reason to be read.  Today millions of poeple read more ad more because of all the books out there.            I do believe however the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different.  It doesn't matter what the books about, some might seem offensive but everyone has something that they dislike.  There are many poeple out there that get deffensive over things, for example certain people, animals, countries, different skin colors, cursing and even sports.  We all have our own opinions, if you do not like a certain book because it has a content that you don't like then it's simple don't read it, others might like it.

"CAPS1 would a person do with out a computer? Well I think nothing because CAPS1 if you are like me that have their family far away in another country well whith a computer you can see them throught a camara and talk to them just like if you where there. Computers just don't take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and CAPS1 was the condition it happend. People that work in a important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don't lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand. Well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier. Many people say that they don't CAPS1 to have to much papers; with a computer you can have all those paper in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it. As you MONTH1 see many people that have computers use it in a productive way. It's not just a pass of time like people say it is. It also helps you do many stuff for your own future: not just to play around with some new friends. Well as you MONTH1 see this are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way.",0

"Builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  First, there was the problem of having a large dirigible moored to the top of the building help by a single cable tether which would add stress to the frame of the building, all the way to its foundation.  To fix this, the frame of the Empire state building would need to be strengthened.  Another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below.  Dirigibles using hydrogen could burst into flames.  Also high winds would make it hard for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast.  The dirigible could not be weighed down since the weights would dangle over pedestrians on the streets.  The effectiveness of these winds was shown when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock.  During this attempt the winds were very strong and the captain of the dirigible feared that it could be punctured by other buildings sharp spires.

When the builders were constructing their plan they didnt consider the fact that the load of the dirigibles would add stress to the entire building.

"Have you ever felt really good after you laughed a lot? Well studies have shown that after you laugh you not only feel better, but it's a great way to lose calories. One time when I felt bad my cousin came over and made me laugh. It was a very important part of our relationship, she to only made the day better but put more energy in it. When people don't laugh how can you have as much fun?  Studies have shown laughing does a lot for your health. It increases a certain blood flow in your brain which helps a person to be more energetic and happy. It has also shown that laughing leads to a longer life span. Also every time a person laughs it helps a person burn calories. If it's healthy for you why not laugh a lot? Just think, if nobody laughed how would this world be? It would be dull and full of unhappy people, just like this one time when my cousin came over to see me.  One day I was feeling down and depressed. Nothing was going my way and it was ending up a very bad day. Then all of a sudden my cousin came to ORGANIZATION1 and surprised me. I was in ORGANIZATION1 one day after school and looking at some things when she came in ORGANIZATION1 and snuck up in back of me and scared me. We both started laughing so hard. She made a bad day turn into a fun one. We had a movie night and ate candy and pickles all night. We made songs up and sang them. We had the best time of our lives. All night long we had this party. I don't know what would happen to everybody if none of us ever laughed.  If we didn't laugh then our relationship certainly wouldn't be as strong. It would seem like we were sad or depressed all the time. If their was no laughing I wouldn't look forward to seeing her as much if we just sat around and didn't laugh. Laughing for me is a huge part of having fun in any relationship. It shows your comfortable with the person and are having fun also. If you have ever been down and wanted to give up, you know that's not fun at all. But whether you watch a funny movie or talk to your friend and it makes you laugh, you know what joy it puts in your life. So laughing must be an important part of you life or in any relationship you have.  Overall laughing for me is one of the most important things a person can do to make another person feel welcome and comfortable around you. Also a great way to have fun and lose calories at the same time. If you need some happiness in your life then watch a funny movie or hang out with people that make you laugh.",0

Basically, computers effect our lives so much in a good way that it would be chaos with out them. Computers allow people to learn how to type which can improve all around skills such as hand eye coordination, they let us connect with places we are not familiar with and see family members, and they allow people to have an online education which can help with the economy. Computers effect us in a very good way and they change our every day lives, CAPS2 children these days cannot type. A recent study done at ORGANIZATION2 showed that PERCENT1 of kids older than NUM1 already know how to type on a keyboard. Computers have such a big effect on us with so many skills that people don't ignoledge enough. Because all of thoes kids know how to type, they can spell better too. I remember one time when I was in the middle of writing a report online. I got NUM2 a word I didn't know and had always had trubble spelling it. So I took my time and typed it out one letter at a time, and it was correct! This example shows that computers can effect everyones lifes, even younger kids. The way that we get information from computers is just like the way our hands get information from our brain to move. For example, when babies learn how to walk the religh on their brains show them how it's done. This is just like how when there is a natural disaster, such as the earthquake in LOCATION1 we religh on our computers to show us and tell us what is going on and how something like this could happen. Computers can effect us this way because there are many things we might never know about our world without them. Computers effect families everyday lives by giving them online educations. My NUM3 year old cusin told me that she was happy her mom could go back to college from home because then they could spend time together. I know you might think that computers can make families get further apart but they actually bring them closer together. There is only one choice and that is that computers effect all of us in a good way. They can help us learn how to type, connect us with our world and bring families closer together. Without computers we wouldn't be the same as we are today.",0
"There were a lot of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, they wanted to add more hight to the Empire State Building so it can be, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation dream"" PERSON1 said. Next, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building so it can allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Then they, ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" Also, ""the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at it's corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms"". The roof had to be completed before the mask can take place. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. In conclusion, those were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.",0

"CAPS2 name is PERSON1 and I will be talking about the wonderful impact computer technology has had on man kind. So many great discoveries and great topics have been found on the compture, studees have shown <PERCENT1NUM1> of famous in the united states has at least one computer in there house holds. There a great way look up important information withoout going to the and searching for hours, to contract others, and lets face it they make our a life a whole lot easier. Imagine this! your stressed and on edge you have just NUM2 hours searching for a topic on your upcoming history essay. You have a pounding head ache and just want to quit, your probably in the libary reading through hundreds of books. Now imagine you being at home sprawled across your lap, all it takes is a few taps on your keyboard and bam! Instant information. Now how easy was that, thats one of the great impacts computer have made on us, humanity. Computers are terrific to learn things with a fast pase to it. I personally have used computers to CAPS2 advantage you logon go to google type the subject of knowledge and its just like you have a personal teacher in your own home. A local study has been underway the have a groups, CAPS6 A which has a libary full of books and CAPS6 CAPS3 a CAPS6 with a CAPS4 CAPS5, The scientist gave them all the same essays, CAPS6 CAPS3 <PERCENT1NUM3> of student have passed with flying colars while CAPS6 A <PERCENT1NUM4> passed with a CAPS9 or higher. Thats important because higher grades, means higher test scores. higher test scores equal fundimg. I think computers are the best invention and is not imparing humans its evolving them. Imagine this! your sitting at home crying because your special other has moved far away from you well computers are a great way to reconect with that person. Computers have software were you can instant message, send emails, or even video chat with that person. For even some business man its an way to have meetings without flying NUM5 miles.

Imagine a chasier counting all the money, a banker having to take time counting one by one other peoples cash, a telemarketer calling with no way of information. All these ways and more that computers have impacted us. Now lets see how has computers not needed our learning ability, contracting others, and last but NOT least made me and yours life better.

"Many obstacles were confronted when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Such as the danger of the non-U.S dirigibles docking. The problem with that is they used hydrogen instead of helium, causing them to be highly flammable. They thought about when the German dirigible crashed and realized how much worse it would be if it happened in downtown New York. Another issue being nature's wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was always aggresively shifting. Plus using lead weights like they do when landing in the fields would be hazard for the people below. Finally the law was a issue. The law stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas. Though two dirigibles attempted they both experienced first hand the dangers of it.",0
"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a few problems. First, they had to figure out a practical way this could be done. When they decided to construct a ""rocket-shaped mast"" that the dirigible could attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first. After the building of the mast was completed, saftey became an issue. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph NUM1) If there were ever an accident with a foreign dirigible, the safety of New York City would be at risk. Also, the dirigibles could not be tied down with weights like they can in an open field. This would also be unsafe for the people of New York. The main obstacle the builders faced with saftey, which is a big issue. Therefore, the dirigibles could not dock on the Empire State Building.",0

"What is offensive? How do we know what offends people, I mean everyone is different, everyone has their own thoughts a beliefs. So how are we suppose to know what offends who?     The things that I would find offensive would be racial discrimination, gender discrimination, or religious discrimination. Those types of things would offend most people I think, but you can never be to sure.     Books will always be books though and you can not tell people what they can and can not write or publish, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech. People will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want. People need to come to sence and understand that consept.     If a book, magazine, song, movie, or any other type of writen or vocal recording offends some one then do not read, listen to, or watch that item. No one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them. People will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases.     Books, songs, movies, magazines, and many other things will always offend atleast one person in the world we live in, but to be honest do we really care if it offends people if that is how we feel or believe? So I believe that if it offends a person then they will not take it off the shelf and if they do then that is their own personal problem people can not tell others what they can or can not write or record, it is their life let them live it.",0

"I believe that computers can be a very good thing to implement in society. First of all, if people never used computers they would miss out on an immense opportunity to learn about the world around them. Also, with computers, people can communicate with people from across the world. If people use computers more often they'll probably develop the skills to pursue job opportunities on a much wider market. Because of this computers can greatly help any community. Computers can give many chances for exploring education. People can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books. People can find alsmot anything they want to know about on the internet relatively easily. If not for solely learning but for reference. If someone is making a project at a school. Computers can expand on many peoples opportunities for education. Secondly, the internet can be used as a widespread communication tool. Any document or piece of information can be transmitted from say, LOCATION2 to LOCATION1 CAPS2.C in a matter of seconds. Simialarly if two people are seperated by a large distance, they can easily communicate since the invention of social networking, people that MONTH1 have lost touch can easily meet again and discuss things. With computers communication is becoming faster and faster. Finally, because of an over-expanding job market, use of computers is becoming a common requirement of many professions. Most jobs that pertain to engineering require use of different programs for modeling and drafting. Also now most governments are networked with files on computers. Also, most any job that has to do with any sort of business has a requirement for the person needed to be able to type quickly. Because many jobs require experience with computers they shouls be a part of any community. In conclusion experience with computers can benefit any one person and entire society all together.",0
"CAPS1 a place where they are all on computers all day long, everyday. I dont think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time exercising, less time enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise. And wouldnt you want to go exercise and lose weight. Other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it. PERSON1 said that PERCENT1 of people that get a new computer spend NUM1 minutes more than what time they usually spend on it. Next, is that you could be outside enjoying nature. New CAPS2 CAPS3 Newspaper said that they are worried that it too many people got a good computer that no body would be outside enjoying what left of nature. Because sooner or later there wont be any trees left in the world and humans would became extinct for eternity. Lastly, is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends. Like when I got x-box live, I couldnt get off of it. I was addicted to it. And when my family got our new computer, my older sister couldnt get off of it. She would spend all day and all night on it. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids they will have more time to exercises more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. Computers are not good toward society.",0
"I'm writing to you today about computers I believe that computers can teach you things such as, hand-eye coordination and how that, can open job doors for you. Also you can socialize as well as study with this device. My first reason being socialization. i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options. one example would be facebook. This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. in a recent poll NUM1 out of NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel. You can talk to people without the long distance fees of . This can range from the CAPS2.S to hungary in seconds. My second reason would be that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good they use hard to find. With the computer you can access multiple sites. This being you can from wikipedia all the way to the infamous google in just . Another reason I believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless. you will get a the . The lost . My third and final reason is computer give you exceptional hand-eye coordination can because I know accountant. i asked him, ""CAPS3 did you take that accounting job?"", and he answered, ""They only took me because I have good hand-eye coordination."" CAPS4 thats one job exemple, another would be real state. Due to computers multiple options you can look up because in the your client. With good hand-eye, however, you can be more efficiecnt with your work. This could help you lead competition, thus, making you more money. This then ends my essay. Stating with socialization, skipping down to studies and ending right on jobs and and bye's front steps. These are only NUM3 of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. CAPS1 I hope you read this with my regards.",0
"As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldnt have trusted but did any way. This led him through the desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water op one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a roll in the cyclist feelings. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact. For example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water. Finally just when his strength was to give out he found the bait place & water and that dramatically and a place to rest too bad there was another old man there, isnt it?!",0
"Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate? Did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from? Well many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more sensorship in libraries but we can not always do this. Maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book. You MONTH1 never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. There are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions. So instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just sensor them.      Censoring seems like a no brainer but a lot of people do not think about it. We can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them. Censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books. The tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book.                    People do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them. Parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading. Although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech. No one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves.      Instead of banning the books or complaining about it them, people could try a rating system for books. When you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves. This is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books. It sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it.     You MONTH1 not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading. If everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure",0

"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been able to anchor blimps to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, architects of time (DATE1's) believed that it was quite possible. What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest issue that was faced was safety of the public. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately why the mooring mast was never a success.",0
"Acording to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles in attempting to attache a dirigible mooring unit to the top of the building. In paragraph NUM1, CAPS1 says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" and Then describes how harsh winds could render the mast unstable. Another obsticle in the making of the mast was a law stating derigibles could not fly under a certain altitude, The set altitude was higher then the building was tall. The last obsticle was safety, in paragraph NUM2 CAPS1 talks about how some blimps are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The effect of a blimp fire over a vastly populated area would be devistating. The mooring mast on the Empire State building was an ingeniose idea, but had to many obsticles to make it work.",0
"Obstacles are faced everyday, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why dirigible could not dock there were obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable elements, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develope. Another obstacle, being faced, was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangeling these weights above pedestrians is very dangerous. Also, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. The idea for making a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a clever idea, but evidently it was impossible.",0

"i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc.",0

"What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, picture, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is CAPS1 parents are so carful with computers, and what their children have access to.      Every situation has it's pros and cons, but in CAPS2 cases if you analize the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult book. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at want they want on the computer.      I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books excetra. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine taht the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as apposed to borrowing if for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop himher from looking at them at a bookstore?           Another issue is banned books. CAPS2 of them are classics that past generations have read in school. CAPS1 would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? CAPS1 would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgetten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, 'CAPS1 would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it.' CAPS2 of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the DATE1, CAPS3 CAPS4 CAPS5 or the CAPS6 CAPS7. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it?      Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completly, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monetering their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer.      I think that there can be come cesorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet edjucational place to learn",0

The third obstacle was the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around uncontrollably.  Lastly, the last obstacle with the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.  These are the many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their",0

"I agree that the effects computers have on people can be very negative to people, but they should realize what they are doing to themselfs and what they can get themselves into. Starting with people are on the computers more then they are using the phone, this takes effects on people sitting around on their computers and not cleaning their homes and taking care of their homes; but instead they are on the laptops or desktops.

"There was many obstacles in the way of adding a mooring dock to the top of the Empire State Building. First was that new many modifications would have to be added to the frame of the building. This is because the previous frame could not hold the extra weight of a NUM1 dirigible hanging from 1 cable. These additions would take ""1 over sixty thousand dollars"" plus extra time and effort,. Another huge problem was saftey. Winds around New York were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to the blimb wraping around the tower and possibly break off or worse. Not to mention that all around was a densely populated city and any accident could cause much more destruction than normal. Forgein dirigibles also used mass amounts of hydrogen, which proven at Hindenburg, could explode into a massive flaming dunk of steel. This chance would be magnified with the weather and any accident would have high human and property costs. Finally, It was illegal for blimbs to fly low near a city, making the whole project illegal. As you can see there is many problems with having a blimb docking center on the Empire State Building.",0

"Do you think books, magazines, or movies that are offensive  should be removed from the shelves stores and libraries?

Today I will inform you NUM1 reasons why boss or managers should removed books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to some people and kids.     One reason, why the boss and managers should removed books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that some times kids go the stores and when the parents are about to pay what they are going to buy kids always get a magazine or a book and start reading it and probaly the magazine or the book have something nasty or inappropriate for kids and they  should not be looking at and the parents do not but attention to what their kids are looking.     Another reason, why the boss and managers should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of the stores and labraries is that for some people when they look at the magazines or books front cover and they see a picture from their culture or traditions and the people who did the magazine or the book wrote someting about thier culture or tradition that the person thinks that was not right or might not be true what they wrote about their culture or tradition and the person might get mad or insulted about what they read about their culture or tradition.My last reason why boss or managers should removed the books, magazines or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that when I go to labraries and I see this little kids waching at the books or magazines and the magazines look nasty or inappropriate I get questinable and in my mind I said 'why the boss or mangers don't removed the books or magazines from the shelves if they look nasty or  inappropriate and that might be something  bad to show them. If the libraries should be good for kidsteenagers and adults for study  in the libraries they should not have offensive books or magazines.In conclusion, I think that the boss or manager of stores or libraries should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries  because they might be offensive to some people and more for their kids. I all ready explind my reason why the boss and manager should removed the books or magazines from the shelves stores and libraries",0

"CAPS2 you think computers benefit society? Well I think so! There are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful. Many citizens in our own community of watertown think computers are a great resource for many things while others disagree with this completely. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet, also you can interact with your friends and family, and lastly there are many applications used for business. On both a computer and the internet there are more than NUM1 million things you can learn. When you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource. You can quickly open CAPS3.com and search any topic at any time. For example, if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet. Another thing you can be taught or informed about is news. There are websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com that give you daily news. I personally use these websites weekly. On the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to. When my family was planning our trip to ORGANIZATION1 in LOCATION1 we used the computer constantly. In the end, computers can teach you many things. Secondly you can interact with people on the internet in many ways. These include social networking websites, webchat and email. Social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past. Websites that were created for this include: facebook, myspace, and twitter. These free websites let you add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web chatting is a way to video people. You can personally see someone from acroos the ORGANIZATION1 from your webcam. Lastly, emailing is a great way to inform people. You can write a visual letter to one of your friends. In conclusion, the computer is one excellent way to interact. Lastly, the computer is used for business. An application called microsoft office is used in countless bussinesses, microsoft office word, powerpoint, excel and CAPS4. Each of these are used to plan, sell, present, manage, and write about products. Microsoft is something you should download in the near future. Business also use webchatting, as I previously state, for conference calls. A production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them. This makes it much easier than to fly half way across the ORGANIZATION1. Finally, computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business. Work sites such as CAPS5 companies use computers to control their machines. I know that the ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their factory due to the fact that I watche the show unwrapped about them on CAPS5 CAPS6. In the end computers are a necessary item in a business. In conslusion, computers have a great affect on people. The can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know. Also, connect humans with each from half way across the ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, businesses would not run well without a computer. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet. Also you can interact with your friends and family, and there are many applications used for business. If I were an expert I would have nothing to worry about concerning computers. They are a magnificent thing. CAPS2 you have the same belief and understanding as me?",0

While building the Empire state building people had to go through some obstacle to have it the way they want. They wanted Dirigibles to be able landbord on the Empire state building. One of there obstacles was the use in New York City and a lack of suitable landing area. The other obstacle was a good one. The use of Dirigibles for the mooring mast was successful.,0
"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" there were several obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, they couldn't just put a mast a top the building because it would put too much pressure on the building's frame. Also the stress would be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was 11 hundred feet below the mast. So before they could build anything, they had to re-inforce the entire structure of the empire state building. Finally these obstacles were fixed, but those were the obstacles the builders fixed.",0
"As far as opinions go, everyone has one. Only in certain situations are people's opinions actually taken seriously. When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an arguement for those who agree and for those who disagree. Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in ones opinion shouuld not be omitted..     At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious. If interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see. Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed.      Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth. The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see. A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at. It would  be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of NUM1, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge. The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit-and-chat session for better understanding.     Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the childs curiousity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and MONTH1 be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child. When the simplist solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated.     Therefore if one person out of millions dislike a book becuase they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep their self away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read.          To agree to removing information form the library is absoulutely purposeless, and MONTH1 be an inconvenience for someone whom MONTH1 have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reaason is to entertain, inform, and educate. By  removing every source all those who agree to the cause should also agree to the fact that they have no remorse for the outcome of how their child grows up and become someone they never wanted them to be.",0

"Somewhere along the road a guy once said ""a laugh a day keeps the doctor away."" CAPS1 the hell was he talking about? I didn't really know or understand the importance of it either. Until i found out first hand how important those words could be, and how right that unknown genius was. It was just a few years ago when the most traumatic event happened to me.Do you remember that first girl or guy you thought you loved? If you can, do u recall that feeling of heartbreak and utter distraught? Well, if u can then u might understand how I felt...and sometimes do feel. If not you MONTH1 learn something of importance to which you might realize why you're single. Before that certain event,when CAPS2 and I would end up fighting, we'd end up making jokes about it to get through. We'd sometimes intentionally go to see romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy in them would break down crying. In one of those sobbing weeping, just obnoxious sounding cries. The kind that pisses you off more than making you feel sympathetic. Back to the later and key point of all of this, when the horrible situation occurred CAPS2 and i were together for years, two and a half to be specific. yeah, long time I know. The day it ended it happened to be in the middle of math class (can you believe that? the middle of freaking class!) CAPS4 convinced me to go sit back in the corner of the room with her. It'd be just us, no interruptions. We did this everyday so it wasn't anything to unusual to me. I was thinking ""yeah! i get to work alone with my amazing girlfriend!"" I was such a idiot. I do fondly remember glancing her over before sitting down. CAPS4 was wearing white bleached jeans and a black band t-shirt. CAPS4 had skin so white and unblemished a porcelain doll would be jealous. To top it all off dirty blond hair, rose petal lips and believe me on this one unending curves. I was dressed similar. I was in my PERSON1 t-shirt, black jeans and my signature burgundy beanie. I had natural tan glowing skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes. When I sat down I'm not exactly sure CAPS1 it was, but I felt like something bad was going to happen. Almost like a oncoming thunder storm or that paranoid feeling of being watched. The most dreadful words fell out of her mouth like water coming out of a faucet. ""We have to break up"" my heart seized in my chest her other words blurred into one becoming inaudible. I remained not moving and completely silent like a stone gargoyle. I couldn't help, but laugh at myself silently inside my head. I didn't ever say anything back. I didn't trust my voice enough to be steady and unwavering. Even if my words didn't...my body did. I couldn't control the shaking of my body as if it was having one big muscle spasm. I quietly and quickly walked out of the room making sure to have my bag in hand. I didn't want a reason to have to come back. The hallways along with the tiles and eventually grass along with the pouring rain all blurred into one. I just kept on walking and walking, with no wear in mind. Until when i was finally to tired to stop. My cheeks were tear streaked to my jawline and my eyes were red and bloodshot. The most wonderful thing in the world to me in my life had ended. As i look back at CAPS2 and I's relationship, laughter was how we survived and got through a lot. It was however not enough. No amount of trying to laugh it off would help, like those petty arguments we had. I will sometimes though look back on how I reacted and that by itself will make me laugh. I was no better than those people in those movies. Unlike them however, I did not weep and bawl obnoxiously.",0

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders ""main obstacle were the wind currents the dirigibles had to face in trying to dock nearly eleven hundred feet in the air. The harsh winds at the top of the building were constantly changing because of the air currents. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles could not even get close enough to tie up to the mast. ""The captain could not even take his hands off the control levers"" (Lüsted NUM1) in fear the outer shell would be punctured by the mast. Additionally, if a dirigible was tied to the mast, it would moving all around the mast based on the unpredictable air currents. However, safety was also a major factor. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted NUM2). Therefore, attempting to tie dirigibles to the mast of the Empire State Building was very unsafe, as the obstacles the builders faced were simply too much to overcome.",0

"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by PERSON1, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.Their biggest concerne was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable""(Lüsted, paragraph NUM1).  The excerpt mentions the German dirigible, the Hindenburg which was destroyed in a fire. ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (Lüsted, paragraph NUM1).Another obstacle was nature itself.  ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (Lüsted, paragraph NUM3).  The unpredictable winds made it impossible to safely dock people onto and off the dirigibles.Finally, there were laws put in place restricting airships flying too low over populated areas.  ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (Lüsted, paragraph NUM4).",0
"Throughout the designing and construction stages of the Empire State building's mooring mast, builders and engineers confronted many issues including, the distribution of building stress, fire hazards and the constant shifting caused by winds. During the planning stages of engineers, they confronted an issue, how to alliviate stress on the Empire State Building's frame. According to engineers making the ""thousand foot dirigible moored at at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame..."" CAPS1, the building would require ""over sixty thousand dollars"" in redesigning and modifying the current building's foundation and framework. Secondly, engineers and builders never considered the fire hazards, which they were confronted with after the completion of the mooring mast. The American dirigibles were filled with hydrogen rather than helium, making that gaseous-filled transportation highly flammable."" An example of this safety violation occurred with the burning of a dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey, causing builders to reflect on the possible severity of this possible accident in the heavily populated area of New York. Thirdly, New York had ""violent air currents"" which could cause the rear of the dirigibles to swivel and shift. The only possible solution was to way down the back with lead blocks, but this would be ""neither practical nor safe."" Engineers and builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with many problems and concerns sometimes only addressed by irrational solutions.",0

"When I was about thirteen me and my older brother dissuaded we where going to spend the day fishing. I got out of bed that morning, throw on a pair of old torn up blue jeans and when downstairs to get some breakfast. On my way I could smell the sweet aroma of eggs and hash browns that made my mouth water. My brother was up and about and had just finished his plate. My mom handed me my plate and and I reached for the bottle of CAPS1.Ethan was sitting across from me as i ate and said""We'll leave in an hour or so"".I said okay and went on eating.After breakfast we gathered our poles and tackle boxes and put them in the car along with an old boat we kind of jacked of the old neighbor lady. We put our stuff in the van and mom drove us into town. It was about eight in the morning so we wouldn't get back home till about three or four in the afternoon depending on how the fishing is. There was a little store in town and the creek went right behind it. It was a small creek. I grew up on it so I thought i knew what to expect. We put in behind the store and our mom left after telling us to be safe. It was a chilly DATE1 morning and a little cloudy. The water was cold and my brother said I should wear his waiters. I thought it was silly seeing as we would be in a boat. Burt I put them on and we put the boat in the water. This was the first time we ever even used the boat so it was exciting.   As we went down stream the water got fast and loud and the embankment was like a wall to the outside world. As we took the next corner there it was. A water fall about as tall as a man. Not the kind you would see in the movies but it was good enough for our eyes. Right in the middle of it was a big rock and water went around both sides of it. We where pushed right up agenced the rock and where all most thrown from the boat and we grabbed the rock for dear life.We where stuck and I looked at my brother and he kneaded as if to say down is the only way.So with that being said we both let go and let the water have us. As soon as we let go it was like being om the back of a two thousand pound animal in a rodeo the only lasts a second. When the boat sunk my waiters filled up instantly and and it took all i had just to hold on to that boat that was pulling us down stream now. We lost all of our gear except the tackle boxes, an oar and that stupid boat. It took all we had but we finally got the boat out of the water and poured the water out of it and the water out of me. I was scared for my life now. This was suppose to be a fun fishing trip but it was now a game of survival. We couldn't turn back now. the only way to got home was to go the rest of the way. I was cold and wet and didn't have any options. We had to continue so we tried it again just to sink. We spent most of that day carrieing the boat around rapids and throw brush all day until it mellowed down and we could put the boat back in. We got to a big pool, so big you could fit a house in it. There where some small rapids running right throw the middle of it. It dint look bad but with what we had bean in we dissuaded to be extra car full. We went around the rapids through the pool. As we went we burly braised the end of the rapids with the boat and we went in. I tried to keep from sinking but my waiters where to heavy. As i tried to swim to shore my shoe fell off and went down stream. Being stupid a chased after it on my belly to get it. The water was faster then I thought as I let it CAPS2 me. I was swallowing so much water and i couldn't breath. I could feel it begin to get deeper and soon I couldn't touch bottom at all. My shoe was right in front of me and I finally got to it with burly anything left. I got to shore and just law there choking up water. After ten minuets I got up and went back. I think it was freak luck we survived that day but some how we did. I learn a lot that day and laugh about it now.",0
"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way. This ways are pysical and mental. The pysical ways that features affect cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and wiredy, this could wear the cyclist out. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep. When its you against gravity, it can be egausting. The temperature can also be a crusal factor in a cyclist pysical ability. Nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist and also be attracted mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a desert the byciclist instintaniously thinks dehydration and death. If some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die. If they see vulture circling them they would get afraid and think death, but the worse thing of all is that knowing all of these things are in the same place at the same time.

"Patience is a good thing  to have. Good things come from patience and bad things dont happen. But what is patience? Patience is being ablle to handle problems without whining and complaining about them. Patience is being able to wait while others cant. Some people are very impatient, such as my dad at some times. For a month or so he had  been saving up his extra money for a new CAPS1. Once he had enough he got a new NUM1 flat screen CAPS1,but if he had waited only about another week he couldve gotten one about a foot bigger for the same price.

"The builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in making a dirigible docking stations. One of the main things was that there was a law in place that banned the use of low flying aircrafts in urban areas, like New York City. Another reason is that it was just not safe to dock these massive blimps that high. Almost NUM1 hundred feet up the winds would have been very violent, and with the tailend of the dirigible not being fastened down, it was very likely that it could get spun around and end up tangled with the mast. Also it was not safe because many foreign blimps were filled with hydrogen which was highly flamable, and if an- accident similar to the Hindenburg with fire occurred over in urban place like New York City it could have been very tragic. Lastly in order to build the mast builders had to re inforce the frame of the building so that it could bear the stress that such a station would put on the structure.",0
I belive the author was saying a new start. I say this because of everything coming back. I also say it because Saeng knows whats important now and will take it seriously. That is what I think the author was saying at the end of the story.,0
"CAPS1 has lately come to my attention that people were saying that computers aren't important. Well, I strongly disagree with that statement. I think computers teach excellent hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even allow you to chat online with family and friends. Computers teach a lot of hand eye coordination. Study's show that PERCENT1 of all football players have excellent hand eye coordination. I'm sure this is because after the football players get home from a big game or something they log into CAPS2 and make thier status all about thier win. Plus, they probably pull up pingball and see how long they can go without getting the little ball down the hole. Do you have good hand eye coordination? My second reason that I disagree with the previous statement would have to be that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places without ever leaving home I mean CAPS1 is so much faster than having to go to the library. At the library you would have to first get there, secend pick out your book, and third check CAPS1 out. with a computer in all that time you could be completely finished with you whole project! Finally, the reason why computers are so important is because CAPS1 keeps people in touch. Do you have family members who live far away from you? I CAPS3 I do. I can't always call them on the phone CAPS4 I want to talk to them so I just log on to CAPS2 and if there online I can have my conversation with that person. I don't CAPS3 about you but I'm really close to my grandma. Unfortanitly she doesn't even live anywhere close to NUM1 hours to me. She's way down LOCATION2 in LOCATION1. By car thats one and a half days and by plane thats three hours! So CAPS1's so much easier to log on CAPS2 and have a private conversation with her rather than driving a day and a half or flying for three hours. So in conclusion I'm sure you totally agree with me. Computers are just amazing! They help you get hand eye coordination, let you research something super quick, and let you stay in touch with far away friends and family.",0

You know how some girl would want a baby ball no not me I want a rex this toy was the bigest and the meanest dinow on the plant well when I was a little it was.

Ever time I go to the story I would go to the toy part of the story, and find that rex and look at it in the eyes in say you will be mine one day. You know how relly want somthing and mom says chismist is coming up. When it ant comeing in till NUM2 months. But I wont it now not in NUM2 months. So I thought what can I do to get the rex befor NUM2 months? I got it!I will clen up more, walk the bog more, do better in school, and hopefully that will work. So I ask my mom mom if I start doing all this good stof can I get so of my chismast thing in a week NUM5 she said no you just get more thing on chismis I was so mad I was about to cry. But NUM2 month was not that long.  I was opening my gifts in no time. but I thought that I open all my gifts, I look arond one good time I did!

"The cyclists condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippiled him or he traveled in search of Yosemite.

"I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because heshe is offended, they are obviously paranoid. If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then don't allow them to get it. Don't make all of the other people suffer. Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem. You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'      CAPS1 of all, people have a variety of opinions. Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok. If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think? They MONTH1 find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book. Then it would create a big conflict.     Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature. They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong. If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover it when they're older? As a child, it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong. Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults.     Censorship is the same thing that PERSON1 did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society. In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in CAPS2 society. The citizens of LOCATION1 have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong. It's one of the ideals that help make this country great",0
"During the construction of the Empire State Building, there were several obstacles the builders faced to have the dirigibles be able to dock on the Empire State Building. The first obstacle the builders faced was figuring out how to modify and strengthen steel frame of the Empire State building to accommodate the mooring mast on top of the building. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a lot of money back in the DATE1's. Once the builders finished framing the entire building, the greatest obstacle to constructing the mooring mast came to be. This obstacle was nature itself. violent air currents would have the back of the blimps swivel around and around the mast. The blimp would need weights to hold it steady, but these weights would be hanging over people on the street and this was neither practical nor safe.",0
"newspaper writer I think the computer has a posative effect of people because CAPS1 helps people around the world learn to speak a different language, CAPS1 helps people talk to their friends around the world and CAPS1 helps people by making CAPS1 easier to write a letter and send CAPS1 out to people they work for or to their bosses that need the report in by the end of the day. Those are the three reason that computers have a posative effect. CAPS1 helps people learn to speak a different language without spending a lot of money like using rosetta stone you have to spend NUM1 us dollars but online you dont have to spend a dime. the best part is that CAPS1 is free. The slogan for rosetta stone is ""I have spent less money than months of formal classes."" I think their new slogan should be is "" we have a better learning company than anyone else."" That is why CAPS1 helps people learn a different language. CAPS1 also helps people by making CAPS1 easier to talk to their friends you can aim, web cast, and ever text to make CAPS1 easier CAPS1 talk to friends on the internet. The reason they created that is so people dont have to travel to far away places and spend money to tell a friend important news that is only one thing. So in conclusion you dont have to spend a lot of money to tell a friend something. The third reason that the computer helps people is that people san e mail theor boss that they are faxing their final repoet to the big interview for a new position in the place where they work, CAPS1 helps your boss by making CAPS1 easier to read and CAPS1 better because you could be in japan and your boss could be in florida CAPS1 will take like NUM2 minutes to get to your bosses computer. That is why CAPS1 is easier to send messages to your boss. The three main reasons are that you can learn a different language without paying a dime that you can talk to your friends easier and that you can send messages to your boss easier that calling him or her. Those are the three reasons that computers are posative.",0

"The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials MONTH1 be offensive towards the foriegn and children.     Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all CAPS1 rated CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves.      One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on LOCATION1 and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the CAPS3 people. I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!     Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie.      We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves",0

"I believe computers aren't having a positive effect on people in this time period for some people theyve really taken over their lives. There are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers. Also there is less time in your schedule for more important things when you're adicted to facebook. Also money will always be less when computers come along! Computers can really be dangerous to you health! For example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run. Did you know, more seizure are induced by compexors than epileptics? Dr. LOCATION1 is as saying ""People don't cause obesity, computers do"" CAPS1 also thinks that the majority of the obeisity is caused by an addiction to computer games. Ever been depressed than taken a long nature walk, and felt great? Well a lot of people tell on rely on thier computer when they're down. Computers usually make things worse. When on twitter, facebook, google and you tube all the time its hard to find time for even the most important things. For example if you're a parent your child might feel abandonned if you start caring about the computer more than very little time spent together could turn them to alchohol or smoking. I let you never of a computer like that! Computer can be good way to wind down but they can also become an addiction there when youre addicted to sitting on a computer you forget about the beauty of nature! Money can also contribute to the addiction. For example shopping addictions are a good way to blow money because it's so easy. All you have to do is type in a credit card number which gives you the illusion that youre not spending money, until the bill comes! Another thing is kids websites like webking which you need to pay for you also need to pay for internet and the electricity bill. It's clear to see that computers cause nothing but health problems, less time in your daily schedule and the money out of you pocket. To me computers are just a trouble in our lives.",0

"Censorship      CAPS1 you are trying to find the right book, music, movie, magizine, you MONTH1 come across some interesting ones. Should libraries ban certain books just because of some contend on one page? The person has that ability to read that book or not.      Banning books has been a huge problem in today's society and needs to be stopped. People should be old enough to choose a book that they enjoy and not have to worry about, does this libary have the book that I want. They should not have to think that way CAPS1 going to a library.

They do not think that they are banning a perfectly good book for others. PERSON2's 'CAPS2 CAPS3' was a big upror wheather or not to put the book on the shelfs. The book intailed the CAPS4 word, and some people were not pleased in this sequence. The book was very well written and just had a few bad words. Should a few bad words keep a book from being a prize winner. The book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be kept in a storage room in boxes.      There are many ways to keep a certain age from gettting a certain book. The library could put those certain books in CAPS5 own part of the library. Keeping the books in a different part of the library might be a better suited way instead of banning the books altogether. The book still will be censored to be in that section or not, but we still will have those wonderful books that we all love so much. What if there was a great informative book about how to do a certain task and no one knew how to do it. That book contained bad language, should the health and knowledge of the world go down because of some bad material in a book, that could help us in the near future.      Authors have just the same right as we do. They should get a say in wheather CAPS5 own book is liable to be on the shelfs. The government should not get all the say in this series matter in hand. The community and the author that writes it should get more of the say then anyone else. CAPS1 an author writes a novel they think of the great content they are putting into this great piece of art not thinking of, is this suitable for children to read. The author just loves to write and should not have to think of all the concerns that they should just not worry about.      There is this book we read this year called 'CAPS5 CAPS6 Are CAPS7 CAPS8'. This book had language that I do not think would be suitable for others in some content that was in the novel. Now do I think the the novel should be banned from a library? No, because it used the words in a very nonviolent way. CAPS1 reading it I felt that I was not harmed by the content and neither were any of my fellow classmates. PERSON1 was the author of this book and I thought she did an excellent job of writing this piece of literature. So the next time you think of banning a book think of all the warm hearts you could be crushing",0
"Letter to the CAPS1 I disagree with the so-called ""experts"" that claim that computers could have negative effects on people. The idea that you socialize less with family and friends is a pathetic arguement. Social networking sites like CAPS2 or CAPS3 allow CAPS22 with all your friends CAPS4 and other online games help you met new people that could be hundreds of miles away from you! Twiter is good when you just want to say something quick like ""CAPS5 to LOCATION1"". CAPS18 allows you to talk to friends, comment on their videos, and subscribe to them, plus it provides hours of entertainment without a fee. Computers also can provide fun games and entertain users. There are many free games, like PERSON1, that have endless possibilities. PERSON1 PERSON1 (made by CAPS6) claims to be the most popular CAPS7 (CAPS8 CAPS9 Online CAPS10-playing CAPS11) on the web. You can level up combat skills: attack, defence, strength, ranged, and magic. Or you can level up skills like wood cutting, prayer, farming, fishing, mining, and cooking. PERSON1, like most CAPS4, has quests, with varying difficulties. For example, for one quest you have to kill a demon, but for another, just find a missing cat. There are over NUM1 quests, and there are never fewer than NUM2 people playing at a time. Some other notable CAPS13 games are ORGANIZATION1 CAPS14: CAPS15, CAPS16 of CAPS17, ORGANIZATION2, LOCATION2, and ORGANIZATION1. As you can see, the computer has an impressive list of entertaining CAPS11 for all ages, not to mention sites like CAPS18 or addicting games. Computers don't really affect exercising. That's a personal choice, so you have to choose between CAPS2 or the basketball court. It's like saying that before we had computers or video CAPS11 consoles, that a CAPS20 board stopped kids from exercising. The computer doesn't actually stop us from exercising. It's our minds that do, and our judgement. If you have bad judgement, you'd stay inside all day tweeting and CAPS21. With a good strong mind and willpower, you can overcome a bad decision and play sports or go to the gym. All it takes is good judgement. Just to recap what I've said, CAPS22 is plenty on computers and there are many choices on how to do it. Many sites amuse us, and we should make use of that. Not to mention you can buy games like CAPS16 of CAPS17 or ORGANIZATION1 CAPS14: CAPS15 for your CAPS13! Computers don't actually hinder exercising, all it takes is good judgement to get off that chair and exercise.",0
"The first main obsticale that the builders faced was the fact that blimps even though they have propellers and rudders are still at the mercy of the wind. And since the wind on top of the building was described as ""Constantly shifting due to violen air currents"" (¶ NUM1) it would be impossible to keep the blimps stable while it was moored on the Empire state building. Just docking the blimp onto the building was an impossible feet, the only blimp that even tried to dock onto the Empire state building, the naval dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the building to get the mooring lines on because they where ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of the othe building in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" (¶ NUM2) causing the dirigible to fall onto the city.The second main obsticale was the public safety aspect of trying to moore a dirigible on the Empire State building There were too many things that could go wrong. The blimp could explode like the Hindenburg, or could run into one of the spires on the surrounding buildings and plumet to the ground potentially killing or severely injuring hundreds of people. That is why trying to dock a dirigible on the Empire State building was an impractical idea.",0
"Builders in The Mooring CAPS1 by ORGANIZATION2 face many obstacles when working to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In order to ensure safety and eliminate problems involving the stress load and pressure of the dirigible on the building, the building would need ""to be modified and strengthened to accommodate"" the blimps, and these modification would cost up to sixty thousand dollars. Many of the blimps were filled with hydrogen, an extremly flammable substance that could put the building and the City of New York in great danger if a dirigible was to blow up. Because winds ""on the top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" there was difficulty controling dirigibles and keeping blimps still to keep passengers safe. There was also a law against the height of airships in urban areas. Using the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would result in breaking the law since the Mast was too low. These difficult obstacles proved too difficult to overcome. as the mast is not seriously used by dirigibles.",0

"In the story, Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an theres No cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost. He didnt have a good map.",0
"The author concludes the story like that to show emphasis.Saeng vowed that so that it will teach her everything lives with hope & adaptation.

"What race are you? What religion are you? What have you been taught? Almost anything like these could be considered offensive. So should these types of things be taken out of libraries?     No, these types of things are everywhere. You just can't get away from them. Today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials. For example the commercials for CAPS1 gum with that CAPS2 woman, some people might consider that offensive. You might ask, 'CAPS3', well there might be a person who has a diesease who can't get that 'clean feeling' and always has bad breath. That person might take offense to these commercials. Another example might be television shows, like ORGANIZATION1. Some CAPS4 and just other races get offended by these types of things. Does that really mean we should get rid of them though?     People everywhere are somehow offended by something, the world isn't perfect. Even if we did take out these types of offensive material in libraries, it could still be seen. So whats the point?          If you tried to take it all out, like everywhere in the world everything would be crazy. There is no such thing as a perfect world, I believe if there was people would go crazy. For example in the movie 'CAPS5 CAPS6,' the main character finds a town that is suppose to resemble 'The CAPS7 CAPS8' or a perfect society. In the town at first everything is nice, but then everyone is so perfect that he can't stand it and leaves.      The best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else. Also they help kids learn, if you keep them locked up and not knowing anything, then how far are they going to get in life?     So should these things go away or not? What do you think?",0
"I don't believe that certain books, music, magzines, or movies should be removed. If they are found offensive then that is not my problem. If they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with. When it comes to any of the mentioned items, sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves.     No matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves. If a book id found offensive by one person or group of people that doesnt mean it should be removed off of the shelves. That is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with.      Anything and everything is educational in it's own way. Even if it is offensive it can teach someone wrong from right. That being said is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to removed from the shelves? It depends on a persons personal views or beliefs. Whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do out there to change that.     It's sad to admit, but there really isn't anything to change that. It's just easier to live with it. Maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive. It depends on what you take offence to. Maybe the writer, director, or composer meant for something to be offensive, maybe they didn't. It's all based on how you take what they said into thought. So when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves. For if one thing must be removed then youi might as well remove everything.",0
The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if its hot and your riding a long way you need a lot of water so you dont  dehydrated.

"The library is a public area where anyone can visit to find a book, movie, or magazine of their desire. Not everyone is interested in the same book genre. The library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of. If someone discovers a book or movie that offends them, they should not make a big deal about it. They should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      I am against the removal of offensive entertainment because it is not fair to everyone else that is a member of the library. What if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing? If the library took that movie off of the shelves, they would lose business due to one person. If a mother of a six year old boy wanted to report an inappropiate movie to the librarian, it would not be fair to anyone that is mature enough for that movie. It just is not fair to everyone else.     The library is public property. With that being said, it is the library's job to please the public's desires for entertainment. They are obligated to suppy books, movies, etc. for whomever. If one person does not like a particular book or magazine, they should search somewhere else for what they want.      A few years back, my mom stopped taking my brother and I to the library. There were too many complaints about inappropiat books being supplied or taken off of the shelves. That year, the library lost PERCENT1 of their customers because everytime the library tried pleasing them, someone else was not pleased.      If every article of entertainment were to remain on the shelf in the library, everyone would be happy. If someone does not approve of a movie or something, they can search another shelf. Those who complain are only making more work for themselves.",0
"The CAPS1 created by the author in this story is a couple different types of moods. One of those moods is a happy and good CAPS1. One example of this is when the author states ""I Learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That shows a good CAPS1 because it is about loving. Next example of a happy or good CAPS1 is when the story states ""Countless extended family members came and whent-and there was often someone staying with us temperally until they were able to get back on there feet."" This shows a happy CAPS1 because they are welcoming people into there family. Another CAPS1 in the story is sad. One example is when it says ""Could not afford to move into a moddest three room appartment"" This is a sad CAPS1 because a you always want the best of for people and if there to poor to afford a good place and that is sad. Also it says ""They struggled both personally and financially. This is a sad CAPS1 because they are haveing trouble getting by. There is more then NUM1 CAPS1 in this story, but the most import CAPS1 I think is loving. A example of loving is when it states ""all thes cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That line right there is showing love. That is the most importand CAPS1 to know in this story, loving.",0
"Computers are a great invention that we have created. Some people are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and hanging with your friends and family. Wait I also agree but spending time on your computer can actually be a good thing. It can be a good thing because you can learn something new every minute, you can also interact with your friends on it, lastly you can do things at the same time hang with your friends and getting exercise. Every minute you are on the computer you can learn something new! For example, let's say that you are on a gaming sights playing a game and suddenly an advertisement appears. It will most likely give you knowledges about the advertisement you are watching. Also study shows that everytime you are on a computer for atleast NUM1 minutes you can learn something new you spend your . Even way for them to communicate is via internetcomputer. This way you can make arrangements. I know that spending too much time on a computer is not all that great, but these are just of the benefits from it so please consider this.",0
"The mood created by the author was a very loving mood. Rodriguez describes his home life as CAPS1 grew up in Newark, New Jersey. CAPS1 describes the Cuban heritage that his parents based their home upon, including the music and the aroma, and ""endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" CAPS1 says CAPS1 grew up with a ""sense"" of family. His neighborhood was different than much of LOCATION2 because ""all of these cultures [Spanish, Cuban, Italian] came together in great solidarity and friendship."" CAPS1 expressed the love his parents had by explaining their hard work as they experience financial and personal struggles. ""CAPS1 says CAPS1 learned the real definition of family through his parents, and is very grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""",0
"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot For dirigibles also known as blimps. The builders of the Empire State building faced a myriad of obstacles. It is proven when it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building Flat Roof... A Thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable Tether, would add stress to the Buildings frame"". They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State building, which can cause pressure to the building which soon might clasp. Another CAPS1 that proves that the builders Empire State faced, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature its self"" The winds on top of the building made it dangerous. clearly there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced.",0
"I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. First, you have to consider what is offensive to most people, and who should be the people to determine if it should be sensored or not. People should be able to decide for themselves if they can or cannot get an item off of a shelf, because they might not even consider it offensive. If you are a parent, you have the right to not let your children watch or read certain materials, but you can't get it taken off the shelf because then it prohibits other people from being able to get that same material that they think is acceptable.      Things that are offensive range from cussing all the way to extreme violence. Some people MONTH1 not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence, but others will find it very offensive. In my personal experience, I tend not to think that a little cussing is offensive, but I do know some people who balk even hearing one minor cuss word. Many movies nowadays are made up of content that is mildly offensive, but only if you take it seriously. The movies make fun of things that people might find offensive, which probably offends those people even more, but they do not have to watch it if they don't want that movie! It just depends on the person and what they have grown up around, or what they think is right or wrong.      It is either your own responsiblity or a parents responsibility to determine whether the content of a book or movie is appropriate. Many times parents use the argument that children are too young to make the judgement on a book or movie, and that is very true. So most children movies and books are appropriate, and do not include content that children are not quite ready to handle. If you are older, then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age. Many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books in movies because those things are already in your life. It comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age.      The idea about taking these books off the shelves would be disastarous. The reading lists in schools would have to be cut down because parents didn't approve, and the children would lose valuable knowledge that is in most literature. One person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive. There would be nothing left in libraries if one person did not approve of something because then every item would have at least one person disapprove.I once read To CAPS1 a CAPS2, and our teacher told us that in another state this book had been banned because a couple of parents didn't like one or two things from the book. This book has many valuable ideas and lessons, and is considered a great piece of literature. These parents wanted the book to be banned from all schools, and all libraries all over the country, and that would be infringing on other people's rights of freedom of speech. The parents can say what they want about the book and not let their own child read it, but they cannot stop that opportunity for everyone else who wants to read the book. Taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well. Literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture. There have been so many movements over time, many started with literature and it affected the culture and the people. Censorship would just take away a part of our culture, which would be devestating.      You should look at your own life, and think about what you find offensive. Then step into someone else's shoes that does not think it is offensive, and see if it is worth it to take it all away from everyone. Almost everything could be considered offensive to at least one person, but it is your own resposiblity to decide whether it is appropriate for you or your child. The shelves should stay full of books, movies, music and magazines. It is our way of expressing freedom of speech, and that is an integral part of our country and our culture",0
"""CAPS1 people have any viruses in there head?"" CAPS2 they need a maricle to pop up away from the computer. Why I stated that is CAPS2 its unhealthy for many people. Its not using time wisely. But most importantly, it can get you into trouble you don't want to be in. Stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured. OMG!!! My stepfather needs to get of the computer! It's unhealthy the amount of time he spends online. He needs to get up and move around. But instead he just sit there online everyday eating. Another reason why its unhealthy is, as you get older your bone's get weaker and when your old you can't move lik you use to and want to. Man just think, if we didn't have a computer, all the timemoney people spend on computers can be spent for stuff more useful. For example NUM1 out of NUM2 people love computers more than life itself.

"There should not be a certain kinds of books in the library. Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment.     If you do not like the book do not have to get the book. While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past. It will not even be a bother. There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that one book. There will always be many more books there to look at. If there is a bad book just go to a different section in the library. There is going to be more good books for a person than bad books.     If other people would like the book then the library will not take the book off of the shelves. It MONTH1 be offensive to some people but there will be some other people in the world that likes that same book. Some people go to the library just to see them kind of books. Certain people like certain types of books, maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in. The book could be a interesting book all there is to do is try it. If anything the reader might even like the book and check it out.     The books are there for entertainment. Thats why they have so much different sections and selections to choose from. If an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid. A different parent might come in and think that the book will be great for their child though.      Books should be sat out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library. The librarians will not take books off the shelf for one persons opinion. When  all they have to do is do not get the book, think that others might like it, or remember they are there for the readers entertainment.",0
"ORGANIZATION1, With the recent development MONEY1 technology in todays society I know that there is a lot MONEY1 controversy with computers. Many people believe that computers are positive towards our society. While others disagree. I feel that technology can be both good and bad. Technology provides great advancements in our world. But people experience less MONEY1 the outside world when they surround themselves with technology. But I feel that we can find a balance between the two views. Having computers has brought a lot MONEY1 advancement in todays society. Look at modern medicine, it would be nothing without todays technology in computers. We can look at todays military. Computers practically run todays armed forces. But who knows where technology can take us. Our society could continue to greatly advance with the help MONEY1 computers. But then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers. So ORGANIZATION1, as you can see computers have helped our society greatly with improvement and progression. But with all MONEY1 this technology we still need to find a balance. It is live todays CAPS1 spend cover NUM1 hours per week on computers. People are not experiencing the world outside MONEY1 their computers. Our state does put in MONEY1 each year for our parks just so we can ignore them. Also with increased computer time people are not getting outside. They arenât getting proper exercise. You MONTH1 even notice that if you use the computer too much you will miss more interactions with your family. So although computers can be very useful you need to be able to turn off the computer and realize the true important things in your life, besides the computers. computers can be both good and bad. But I think that we need to find a balance between the two. Computers are useful to our daily life but at the same time we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers. Lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function. Entire companies revolve around computers and if computers just ended, MONEY1 MONEY1 people would lose their jobs. But also regular people, for example teens, do not need to be on the computer for four hours a day. Those four hours could be spent with their families. We need to find a balance. For example, you could say for every hour your on the computer you need to spend that same hour to go outside, spend time with your family, etc. Computers are useful but we cannot over use it. So, to the ORGANIZATION1, computers help our society thrive. But at the same time we need to learn when we have had enough time on the computer. So I believe that we can call find a healthy balance MONEY1 computer use.",0
"My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways.     Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person.  If they are not that big of a problem they shouldn't be removed.       People might change their mind about going to that particular library, if they find a lot of offensive things there.  Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds, and it could possibly change how most children act, or think.  A few things that I would find, that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying.     From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live, if you take them seriously.  Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos.  I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it.  In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they  are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them.     I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things, from all libraries.  Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials",0

"When you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about? Some from their own experience and some made up. I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed. The authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read, hear or watched by people that are interested in them! Also if the libraries are having diffculties with the complainments towards the offensive materials they should just make a separate section.     To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for? Easy one! To entertain us; to expand our knowledge on things; to let us have intrest. If none of these things were invented, life would be boring, now i'm not saying we need these offensive materials, i'm saying it's there so we can think bigger about topics instead of them same-o-same-o. Producer produced 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of library where nobody goes just because it has some things others MONTH1 not like. If you don't like those type of things, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries stop the people that made those things from making money? Does that seem right to you? It's bad enough they're sencond guessing if they're good enough to be shelve worthy. There's many books out there that are horible and a waste of time reading it, so should they be removed to? Think about that one.     Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section. It MONTH1 cost money, but what's more better loosing tons of costermers or finding extra room? Libraries are very big already and i'm sure they could find a little bit more room, they separate everything into genres already.     Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of  materials from shelves. There MONTH1 be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff. Teenagers especially, they MONTH1 get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff. I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and teering there inside out, this man got a idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn. The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves. Still I don't think it should have been removed because an imature, ignorate person thought it would be cool to do it. The book was made up and the guy was most likely dellusional and sick in the head to do it. And because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it.     In conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive. Some people just have ignorance to not understand the books, music or movies was made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff exposed. Like i've said recently it was made to be either read; heard; or watched. A separate section would be a great idea.",0
"I CAPS1 would like CAPS4 if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right? I am the kid that has no choice in the matter. CAPS3 should I not care about what I am forced not to see? I am sure there are alot of parents that dont follow the censorship rules. Like buying a rated 'CAPS2' movie, or game for their kid that is NUM1, and not NUM2 years old, but CAPS4 does matter that the parents are following the law. I say shrew the law, because when CAPS4 comes down to CAPS4, its the parents right to tellshow there kid about things, not the goverment.      I Think that CAPS5 have never really had a choice in matters that affects them directly, and I think we should. CAPS5 have to follow what ever rules untill there NUM2 years of age: CAPS3? I wish I knew CAPS3, but I dont. Because there is no logical reason for CAPS5 not to have a vote on what affects them.           For all I know there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerfull then the last generation. I am not saying that this is true, I am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen.     Video games, They are my weakness I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored. When people say things like 'CAPS5 who play video games with violence will make them murders.' CAPS4 makes me frustrated. There is not one single thing that proves that.      I have known CAPS5 who have been censored all there life, and when they learn about CAPS4 all they cant even handle CAPS4. Its sad really to not beable to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world. Just because they have been kept away from all that all there life.     I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. Did their parents tell them CAPS4 was bad, and never watchread CAPS4? Where did they hear CAPS4 from? I beleive CAPS4 came from the media CAPS4 self. I can see the headlines now, 'CAPS5 watching CAPS6 movie cause them to be murders.' Then they would have some made up percentage on how manny CAPS5 turn in to a murder that watch CAPS6 movie compare to CAPS5 that don't.     What I am really saying is that I try not to let other peoples beleifs get in my head and change my own beleifs. Even by me writing this MONTH1 have cause someone to change there beleifs, and I really CAPS1 hope I haven't.",0
"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were CAPS1. In CAPS2 NUM1 it reads that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to  building's frame work."" This CAPS3 that the designings of the Mast was going to take some time.

"I think that no CAPS1, Book, CAPS2, or any sort of music should ever be takin off the shelf, if u dont like what they say in these NUM1 catagories dnt wach listen read or anything.  Just because u dont like it doesnt meen somebody else doesnt.  I mean think about it is there a CAPS1 or a song or a sintance thats so terrible that you need to take it off the shelf i say no.  Also beacuse somebody might have not got to read see or listen to that CAPS1 song or book ya no what i mean.  Plus all that money and time and hard work it took to make the song, book or CAPS1 it takes up to like almost NUM2 years for a CAPS1 to come out and when a song comes out u hardly even no its new because they never tell you like listen to bullet for my valentin's new song on NUM3 or anything and when a new book comes out it's usually like harry potter or somthing like that but no, no CAPS1 should ever be takin off the shelf's nor book nor music nor magizine.

"When I was young me and my friends would play at CAPS1 CAPS2. CAPS1 CAPS2 was a CAPS2 in the middle of a orchard, there was a slide, diving bored, and two rope swings. All DATE1 long we would sit, play, swim, and laugh down at the CAPS2. We would have are CAPS4 day party, and calibrate the CAPS5 of DATE2 down at the CAPS2. There is one day I can remember so well that its like it was yesterday. The last day of school had just ended, my friends and I got on the bus as fast as we could. When the bus stopped at the CAPS2 we all started running and striping down to are swim trunks. I was the first one in, as a result I was the first one to relies the water was as cold as the river, it felt like a thousand little nettles stabbing me over and over again. My friends described me as a bouncy ball because I got out as fast as I got in. As soon as my friends saw my blue lips the all started laughing so hard that some of them fell in to the freezing water themselves. After that we walked you to CAPS1 house and asked him to turn on the generator, after about an hour the lake was warm enough to swim in. After a we all had swam around for a bit we decided to go of the rope swing. After a while we started doing back flips, when we stopped are backs and chests were as red as the apples in the orchard, and are throats hurt from laughter. As well as being sore from hitting the water over and over again, we were also hungry so we fired up the grill and started making burgers. When the first and second batches resembled a mound of coal, we decided to order pizza. We spent the time by air soft, when the pizza arrived the lake had thousands of air soft CAPS7's floating in it. As we ate we sat on the small dock and stuck are legs in and collected what ever CAPS7's came near. Soon after eating we started playing hide and seek in the orchard. After ten or so rounds we were all scraped up by running throw the trees, so of course we pored soda on are cuts, to this day I still wonder why we did that because it really hurt. Once we were done being stupid we laughed at are self's, then we laughed at each other. It wasn't long before we played swimming base ball, the bases were the corners of the docks and the pitcher was on the floating plat form. we used floating balls and swam from base to base. Eventually the sun started to set and we made a fire by the side of the CAPS2 and roasted marshmallows over it. When are CAPS9 came to get us we were in the middle of a belly-flop contest. Before we left we promised that we would never forget that day, and that we would be friends forever and laughter would always be the glue. That night I stayed up all night thinking of all the fun and all the laughs we had that day, it was definitely the start of one of the best and one of the most memorable summers of my life.",0
"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant.
